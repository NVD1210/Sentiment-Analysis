            "Length of reviews: ['Like iphone 11 Pro, Macbook Pro, Airpad Pro; the \"Pro\" denotes a higher end product. Compared to the Airpods (version 2) highest end model (with wireless charging case*); the Airpods Pro is $50 more MSRP. Compared to the non wireless case version it\\'s $90 more *Airpods Pro does have wireless charging case by default. Only one version. Let\\'s go through the differences 1. Physical Appearance: Shorter Stem, but larger bud or head There\\'s a large black airflow grill A mic inside and outside the Airpods Case is same thickness, a lot wider, but shorter. Still uses lighting cable to charge, but it does come with a lighting to USB-C cable 2. In-ear, instead of on-ear If your ear has a small cavum and the original airpods fit perfectly, then the Airpads Pro may be a tight fit/more uncomfortable, but seeing the in-ear design, the ear piece will go into the ear canal and the rest will float in place. Those with normal or larger cavum it\\'ll fit well. Some may not like the ear piece going into their ear canal These ear phones are more for a closed environment than an open one Seeing that it\\'s an in-ear design, you may feel this hollow air effect going on unless you turn on transparency mode (more on this later) or play music with active noise cancelling on Seeing that it\\'s in-ear, it has a tighter grip, better for joggers, those who shake their head around a lot for some reason, or if you run up stairs often. If you have an intense workout regimen and/or do extreme sports and not mindful it still can fall out There\\'s a Ear Tip Fit Test on app. There\\'s several ear tips in box. When you turn on this feature in app it\\'ll calibrate and suggest what ear tips are best listening experience for you If you lose the tips or get them dirty overtime, you can go to the Apple store and get replacement pair for around $4 or get cheaper 3rd party ones when they come out 3. Squeeze instead of tap Instead of tapping on the earbuds, you are pinching or squeezing the stem. 1x to play, pause, and answer calls 2x to skip forward tracks 3x to skip back tracks Press and hold to switch between active noise cancel and transparency mode Still able to say \"Hey Siri\" to do voice commands/adjust volume anytime No physical volume controls on buds 4. Battery life Battery life varies depending on how far away you are from the device and volume you set. Battery depreciation over time. These are just rough estimates Pro in general has 4.5 listening time with active noise cancelling or transparency on. Airpods version 2 has 5 hours. Note Airpod version 2 does not have active noise cancelling or transparency mode.  You can get 5 hours with noise cancelling and transparency off, but most likely you\\'re not going to unless you\\'re really desperate for battery Pro has 3.5 talk time. Airpods have 3 hours Case both old 24 hours battery life Pro: 5 mins in case = 1 hour talk or listen time. Airpods 15min in case = 3 hours listen, 2 hours talk 5.  Water/sweat resistant Now you can go to the gym and do cardio with them on. As mentioned before, tighter grip seeing that it\\'s in-ear May survive light rain. Do not recommended going in the shower or dunk in the pool with it though  6. Active noise cancellation, Transparency mode Airpods pro has 3 modes: Active noise cancellation, off and Transparency mode Active nose cancellation tries to block out outside noise while listening to music. I\\'d say it drowns out may 70%. If you focus to outside or aren\\'t focused to music; you still may be able to pick out what\\'s going on, but in general it does it\\'s job. Off is just like the standard in-ear headphones, but with the hollow air sound when no music is playing Transparency mode. The black airflow grills let in outside sound so you\\'re able to hear both outside sound and music same time. Think of it as open ear headsets. Unlike some in-ear headsets the black airflow grills prevent you from hearing yourself in your head when you talk 7. Sound Quality Better than the previous version seeing the active noise cancelling and in-ear with more focused sound direcly into your ear canal. It\\'s not $250 audiophile quality sound.  Better quality sound in lows and mids compared to non-pro version. If you ever tried the Power Beats Pro, it sound very similar to those You can hear callers better in a noisy environment and less likely raise your voice --Conclusion: Other than that, all other features are the same. Meant to be used on Apple devices. Very good ease of use for Apple users, and is in-style these days (shows social status). Sound quality is better that the non-PRO version, and you do get noise cancellation.

Call support and they said to return them.', 'Like iphone 11 Pro, Macbook Pro, Airpad Pro; the \"Pro\" denotes a higher end product. Compared to the Airpods (version 2) highest end model (with wireless charging case*); the Airpods Pro is $50 more MSRP. Compared to the non wireless case version it\\'s $90 more *Airpods Pro does have wireless charging case by default. Only one version. Let\\'s go through the differences 1. Physical Appearance: Shorter Stem, but larger bud or head There\\'s a large black airflow grill A mic inside and outside the Airpods Case is same thickness, a lot wider, but shorter. Still uses lighting cable to charge, but it does come with a lighting to USB-C cable 2. In-ear, instead of on-ear If your ear has a small cavum and the original airpods fit perfectly, then the Airpads Pro may be a tight fit/more uncomfortable, but seeing the in-ear design, the ear piece will go into the ear canal and the rest will float in place. Those with normal or larger cavum it\\'ll fit well. Some may not like the ear piece going into their ear canal These ear phones are more for a closed environment than an open one Seeing that it\\'s an in-ear design, you may feel this hollow air effect going on unless you turn on transparency mode (more on this later) or play music with active noise cancelling on Seeing that it\\'s in-ear, it has a tighter grip, better for joggers, those who shake their head around a lot for some reason, or if you run up stairs often. If you have an intense workout regimen and/or do extreme sports and not mindful it still can fall out There\\'s a Ear Tip Fit Test on app. There\\'s several ear tips in box. When you turn on this feature in app it\\'ll calibrate and suggest what ear tips are best listening experience for you If you lose the tips or get them dirty overtime, you can go to the Apple store and get replacement pair for around $4 or get cheaper 3rd party ones when they come out 3. Squeeze instead of tap Instead of tapping on the earbuds, you are pinching or squeezing the stem. 1x to play, pause, and answer calls 2x to skip forward tracks 3x to skip back tracks Press and hold to switch between active noise cancel and transparency mode Still able to say \"Hey Siri\" to do voice commands/adjust volume anytime No physical volume controls on buds 4. Battery life Battery life varies depending on how far away you are from the device and volume you set. Battery depreciation over time. These are just rough estimates Pro in general has 4.5 listening time with active noise cancelling or transparency on. Airpods version 2 has 5 hours. Note Airpod version 2 does not have active noise cancelling or transparency mode.  You can get 5 hours with noise cancelling and transparency off, but most likely you\\'re not going to unless you\\'re really desperate for battery Pro has 3.5 talk time. Airpods have 3 hours Case both old 24 hours battery life Pro: 5 mins in case = 1 hour talk or listen time. Airpods 15min in case = 3 hours listen, 2 hours talk 5.  Water/sweat resistant Now you can go to the gym and do cardio with them on. As mentioned before, tighter grip seeing that it\\'s in-ear May survive light rain. Do not recommended going in the shower or dunk in the pool with it though  6. Active noise cancellation, Transparency mode Airpods pro has 3 modes: Active noise cancellation, off and Transparency mode Active nose cancellation tries to block out outside noise while listening to music. I\\'d say it drowns out may 70%. If you focus to outside or aren\\'t focused to music; you still may be able to pick out what\\'s going on, but in general it does it\\'s job. Off is just like the standard in-ear headphones, but with the hollow air sound when no music is playing Transparency mode. The black airflow grills let in outside sound so you\\'re able to hear both outside sound and music same time. Think of it as open ear headsets. Unlike some in-ear headsets the black airflow grills prevent you from hearing yourself in your head when you talk 7. Sound Quality Better than the previous version seeing the active noise cancelling and in-ear with more focused sound direcly into your ear canal. It\\'s not $250 audiophile quality sound.  Better quality sound in lows and mids compared to non-pro version. If you ever tried the Power Beats Pro, it sound very similar to those You can hear callers better in a noisy environment and less likely raise your voice --Conclusion: Other than that, all other features are the same. Meant to be used on Apple devices. Very good ease of use for Apple users, and is in-style these days (shows social status). Sound quality is better that the non-PRO version, and you do get noise cancellation.

Call support and they said to return them.', 'Received my AirPods Pro a couple of days ago and have been using them day and night since. I also have the new Bose 700\\'s, which I\\'ve been using daily for a couple of months so I\\'ll compare to them. I commute each day on a noisy city bus. Sometimes there are people talking and sometimes there\\'s nothing but the loud noises of the bus. The Bose headphones are not sweat or weatherproof, and so are not useful outside unless the skies are clear. With winter coming, the Bose also prevent wearing a winter hat, so I decided to buy the Air Pods for use in commuting and then use the Bose once I get to my desk at work. I have never owned AirPods before. A friend at work has regular AirPods (not Pro), and the photo attached to my review shows the difference in size. These were easy to set up -- you just hold your unlocked iPhone a couple inches away from the AirPods in their charging case (with the case open). It\\'s all seamless. They automatically showed up in my Macbook bluetooth menu once connected with the iPhone, so all I had to do was click \"connect\" in the bluetooth menu. Interestingly, the play/pause squeeze of the stem doesn\\'t seem to work for controlling the laptop -- maybe it only works for Apple Music, which I don\\'t use so I didn\\'t test. And the other thing different -- and worse -- than the Bose is that if I pause on the laptop and then play again on the phone, the AirPods are not automatically connected and the music came out of the phone directly. The Bose connects to two devices at once so it will play whichever one is playing sounds (which can be annoying if the phone is playing and the computer gives a notification sound or vice versa). But in order to play again on the phone, I had to go into the phone Bluetooth menu and reconnect (not re-pair, just reconnect). So my conclusion is you have to manually reconnect for device switching. You get a little alert sound when connected -- no voice, no battery status, no \"connected to xxx\" like the Bose does -- nothing else. For music quality, the Bose quality is a fair amount better -- which would be expected since they are full size over the ear headphones. The AirPods Pro are still very good though, and unless you are an audiophile, you won\\'t be disappointed. Charging the AirPods case uses a standard iPhone/iPad lightning charger. It comes with a cable that will connect to a later model Macbook USB C port -- so USB C to lightning. If you want to use an outlet, you will need to have an existing lightning charger, which most of us have plenty of anyway. It\\'s hard to tell when the case is completely charged. The orange light comes on but goes off after just a few seconds, instead of just staying on and changing to green once they\\'re fully charged. The first night I got them, I charged them in the case overnight before using them. When I connected them, they said the AirPods were only 58% charged, so I\\'m not sure why they weren\\'t 100% if left in there overnight. There is a nice new longpress feature on the volume of the iPhone that appears when the AirPods are connected to the iPhone. You can control the volume (you can\\'t control the volume right on the AirPods, which is a slight bummer but it\\'s okay) and noise cancelling from this new interface. There\\'s no tapping on these AirPods -- you slightly squeeze the little stem. There is a soft click when it registers, almost like pressing a touch pad. It took a few seconds to figure out how to do it, but it\\'s been fine since. A longer squeeze toggles between the noise cancellation modes. There\\'s a slightly different sound for going into transparency mode and going into noise cancellation mode, but in a quiet room it\\'s hard to tell which mode you\\'re in, as opposed to the Bose, which literally tells you in a voice. Transparency mode uses microphones to let in the sound around you, so that you can keep them in while still talking to people. This is how they differ from noise isolating earbuds, which block your ear from hearing anything but don\\'t have active noise canceling. These have noise canceling I\\'ll talk about in a minute. But there is also an \"off\" mode available only (that I\\'ve found) through the volume long press described above. These just put them in basic noise isolation mode -- I\\'m guessing similar to previous AirPods. For noise cancellation, they are surprisingly very effective. More effective than I thought they would be. They are best at blocking out white noise -- bus engines, office sounds, fans, etc. They are good at voices if it\\'s just people talking in a group at a normal volume. But when I walked through the busy office cafeteria at lunch time, they did not do as good of a job as the Bose at blocking out the loud talking and other uneven cafeteria noises. Interestingly, they do a great job at blocking one-off noises like a door slamming or someone dropping something. The Bose have a hard time with sounds like that for some reason. I would say they are 80-90% as effective as the full size over ear Bose overall, which is very impressive. For comfort, obviously the Bose are better (and sound better) for hours of desk usage, and also given that the battery on the Bose is about 19 hours and these are about 4, the Bose will be what I use all day at my desk. But for moving around, walking the dogs, commuting, and portability, the AirPods are terrific and don\\'t hurt at all or cause my ears to sweat like the Bose do after a while. Would definitely recommend.', 'So, they don’t come with a charging cable that can actually be used—so don’t forget to buy one. That kind of sucks. Since I can’t use them, overall review... yeah... 1 star. 🤷🏽\\u200d♂️', 'Apple AirPods Pro is one of the best noice cancelling in-ear headphones available in market. Price is on the upper end but the quality is also on the upper side compared to other models. I have QC35 and the noise canceling is comparatively good but being in-ear, the listening experience is much better. The transparency mode is awesome. It is like you NEVER wore the headphones. You have to try to experience it. I use it all the time in car and it is true “your gasoline car sounds like an electric car”. Fit is snug and with extra tips, most of the people can get accurate fit. Make sure to run sound seal test from Bluetooth setting of AirPods. Each earpiece is about 1.25 inch, little shorter than earlier versions but they still stuck out of your ear and look little weird. Out of box, it comes with Airpods with wireless charging case, extra tips and USB-C to lightning cable. Note that it does not come with charging brick which is a bummer. But you can charge it with any other lightning connectors. Overall these are pretty decent noice cancelling headphones. Price is on the upper end, but I think quality is also on the upper side and I do think these are worth it. Would definitely recommend.', \"I thought they were pretty nice at first. Sound quality is good. They charged quick in the case. But transparency mode amplified sounds like crazy. At the gym someone was moving weights, the cling of them hitting was so loud it hurt my ears. When I took the airpods out it was much quieter in real life. Even in noise cancelling mode they pick up voices and then they end up sounding robotic. There's a white noise in the background too. It's like a little static, annoying as hell. Just now I started hearing a popping noise in the right bud. It kept happening even when the music was off. When I turned to transparency mode that popping became a buzz.\", 'They feel a lot snugger, 100% worth it.', 'If you’re thinking about these and currently own the original style of AirPods, please check out my review below! Are these a replacement to the original AirPods? Not necessarily. I own these and two original style AirPods. I am an Apple fan girl and own one of everything they’ve got. But even then, I’m on the fence about the Pro’s. First off... Comfort and Fit If you’ve ever tried out the PowerBeats by Dre, they fit just like them minus that extra ear anchor. It takes some getting used to but thanks to transparency mode, I don’t think I could really wear another pair of IEMs / earbuds again. They 100% will not make you feel like your ears are clogged and not can you hear your own voice as one would with earbuds. However, I’m hung up on the fit. I was one of the lucky few who the original AirPods fit just right. However, these just hurt after 20-30 minutes. I tried all the different sizes  of ear tips but none work. Ultimately, I wish Apple included foam versions of their ear tips. So be warned that these might hurt! Assuming they don’t hurt, then... Sound Quality The sound quality is great. It’s nice and clear, balanced and at times not packing the bass I was possibly expecting. The HomePod has a very, very strong bass signature and I thought these would be similar. But, nope! When third party foam air tips come out, I’m pretty sure that will help the bass out. (Bass needs a good seal when it comes to earbuds.) Are these better than the original AirPods? Maybe. Because of that seal from the ear tips, the sound quality is drastically improved. With third party ear tips, the original AirPods sound pretty similar to these. I do appreciate the dynamic EQ which helps the sound a lot. But, be warned that they will sound like garbage if you have an EQ set in Apple Music on your iPhone. Make sure to set it to off or Late Night, otherwise they’ll sound a lot worse! Ultimately, you won’t be disappointed and they sound great, better than the originals because of that sound seal, but not mind blowing! Battery Life They’re pretty in par with the original AirPods with battery life even with Transparency and noise cancellation on. You can go all day with these just like the originals! Speed This is what I love about them the most! This is the reason why I prefer these over the original AirPods. The Pro’s are so much snappier with Handoff, switching from device to device, pausing and restarting, etc. They also more accurately get picked up by your iPhone and Apple Watch. I really wish they would upgrade the hardware in the original design just like these. (We’ll see!) also, the Pro’s more intelligently go on standby when out of your ear, resume faster when they go in your ear, etc. They just do everything faster! I also appreciate the fact that you pinch the stem instead of tapping them. Whoever thought of tapping didn’t realize how uncomfortable that “gesture” would be in practical usage. Overall I love them but they’re like the cousins of the original AirPods. They’re not a replacement but a different flavor. These are great for working out and stay in my ears during running. The new features and speed in combination with the improved sound delivery makes them an easy upgrade — so long as you find them comfortable, that is!', 'So uncomfortable to wear... to make the noise canceling effective I have to shove the rubber tip into my ear which starts to hurt my hear. I have to sit absolutely still otherwise they begin to lose the seal required to get ANC. I have tried all 3 sizes too. They fall out of my ear in the gym. People are just high on apple. Sound quality is laughable. The most over hyped piece of garbage.', 'Not worth the money. New  Features are not worth the difference from AirPods . WAit till they come in different  colors', \"Should have listen to the other reviews, I'm beyond embarrassed. I bought these as a gift for my brother in law and these turned out to be FAKE. I contacted apple and they confirmed it, even tho the serial number is real!!! things to look out for because these are really well made FAKES - has noise cancelling/transparency but doesn't work when turn on ( in the real ones it clicks) - in setting under general/about they should appear to show the serial number - obvious bad sound quality/ not work left/right earbuds - last, these fakes were lighting blue in the earpiece itself. just wait a couple more days for apple or best buy.\", 'As a big fan of technology, I own Apple AirPods 1,2, AirPods pro, beats studio3 and couple other headphones. And AirPods pro is definitely one of my favorite. Pros: • It is very easy to get into and stay in my ear. It won’t fall out. Also it is much more comfortable than Powerbeats pro. • The ANC works surprisingly well. It is very similar to my beats studio 3. It is amazing how Apple fits everything Into such a small body. • The bass is better than AirPods 1 and 2. It feels more bouncy. Cons: • Since AirPods pro doesn’t support tap control any more. 2 fingers are required to pause or to control the AirPods, which IMO is not as good as tap control. Overall, it is good although a little pricy. Update: After using it for couple months, I have to say I was wrong about not falling off. Sometimes they do fall off. And AirPods 1 and 2 stay better in my ear.', 'Sound quality and the noise cancelation feature are decent, nothing like Bose though. My main issue is the fit. They just fling out randomly while you are on the go or working out. I have tried all of the different ear buds provided by Apple but in vain. The price is very high compared to what you get. There are better options in the market for this price.', 'I bought a pair of these after Xmas. It took over a week to get here but I thought ok they are from Warehouse and its worth it. Maybe someone got them as a gift and returned them new. It was described \"like new\". When I paired them with my phone only the right ear of the AirPods worked. The left ear barely displayed sound. It was defective. This is the 2nd time I have bought Apple products from amazon that were problematic. That were \"inspected\". Just buy from Apple. They have a great return policy and if they are \"refurbished\" from Apple- the quality is the same as a new product. Whereas here if you buy from the Amazon Warehouse- most likely they have an issue.', 'Charging box came broken, visible dent and damaged hinge...quality control questionable. Actual working life on one charge not impressive, not practical to carry charging box around....if You need to use them, product has quality sound and very good noise cancellation with pretty short life - 4 hrs new.', 'I really wanted to love these but they simply do not stay in the ear. Tried all three tip sizes and no luck. The sound and noise cancelation is good but so far this is useless to me.', \"I'm sorry I bought the new AirPods Pro.  I have owned the original AirPods for years.  I wore the originals almost constantly and honestly can only remember once that they came out of my ear.  I just never worried about them.  This is NOT the case with the new Pro.  They fall out of my ear everyday and many time more than once a day.  I mean you bend over to pick something up and they are likely to fall out.  I have tried all three ear bud sizes that come with the Pro, and while the new design looks like it would be better beware, they fall out!  Sick with the original AirPods! The sound of the Pro is great!  The new noise cancelation is excellent.  The battery life seems to be a bit better than the original and I really like the ability to pause the playback by touching the Pro.  (If only they stayed in my ear! )\", 'I really like the old air pods and have bought a few for my family, also used them everyday for 8+ hours straight  without any problem. Although the new air pods pro cost more and sounds great with some extra features, I don\\'t think it\\'s for me. If I use it for less than two hours or so there won\\'t be any problems as it preforms very well. The main problem is that if I wear them for over 2+ hours they start to hurt both my ear which is weird because the older models \"wired/wireless\" I have no problem with while they are in my ear all day long. \"I have tried changing the rubber from large to small still doesn\\'t help.\" It seems like the new design are a little thicker than the older generations. Also a minor problem I have is taking them out which doesn\\'t bother that much. So I would advise testing them out at least 2-4 hours to see if they are for you before keeping it. Overall they look and sounds great.', \"When I thought the old Airpods were already very good, Apple came out with something that's even significantly better. Pros: - Fits: very well. The old Airpods fit my ear well, these new ones fit even better. My ears do not get hurt after hours of wearing. And these do not even come close to falling out when I run. - Noise cancellation and transparency mode: both work amazingly. - Waterproof. However these are only splash proof. Meaning rain/spills/sweat are ok, but no swimming yet. - Sound quality: very decent. But probably not too insane to satisfy audiophiles. - Build quality: superior, as expected from Apple. Especially when consider small details like the silicon eartips. They snap extremely well into the Airpods and are very, very hard to remove. - Sync: very well with iPhone and Mac, as expected from Apple. Have not tested with Android, Windows. - Size: very conveniently small. You can easily wear them lying down in bed. Traveling case is also pretty small (just a tad bigger than old Airpods' case) - Design: this is very subjective. But I think the Airpods are the best looking earbuds in the market right now. Big reason why I choose them over other headphones. Cons: - Battery life: they're ok, I wish they last longer. Quote from Apple, battery lasts up to 4 hours 30 minutes of music time. In reality it lasts a bit more than 4 hours. But sometimes I wear them continuously way longer than that. Very sad.\", \"Did not fit and kept falling out. I tried the small, medium, and large tips. None of them worked and didn't find anything special about these pods.\", \"Apple hit a home run with these... I wanted the original AirPods but couldn't get them to fit in my ear. I have tried other true wireless earbuds and never liked the look or fit of them. With the AirPods Pro, Apple has answered my prayers, and they're even better than I could have imagined. The sound cancellation is LEGIT. I own the Bose 700 noise canceling headphones and while they're not as good at noise cancellation as those, I'm blown away by how close it is. The sound quality as well sounds very good to me. I'm by no means an audiophile but I'm a little picky as far as this goes and I'm more than pleased. The ability to switch from noise canceling to transparency mode is awesome as well.\", 'Received fake AirPods without the charging cable or any accessories. How do I know they we’re fake? Because they were cheap plastic , didn’t look at all like real ones, and didn’t even turn on. Spoke to Amazon and they said sorry you got screwed by some new ones. So if you are looking to buy them I guess just cross your fingers and hope that you get real ones because Amazon won’t take responsibility for a product they sold :/', 'It’s a little hard to know what is good or bad about my new $250 airpods because they do not come with a way to charge, you have to go out and buy some adapter or a charging pad.  I cannot believe they sell you a device, includes a wire but not plug.  Ridiculous.', 'Wow... these just got delivered 45 minutes ago and I am incredibly disappointed in my purchase. Usually I am the type of person to Go out of my way to leave GOOD reviews. But after this years Apple problems, I feel it necessary to go out and let people know what they’re getting into. These are probably the worst headphones I’ve ever used in regards to any bass at all. My original AirPods have a much more rich and full bass spectrum. An utter and complete disappointment in regards to the full range of audio quality. I even did the “share audio” Feature and kept swapping back and forth between the AirPod 1’s and the Pro’s. The originals not only have a much more fabulous bass response, they also have an altogether higher volume output. Some may argue that with noise cancellation that there’s no need for higher volumes... I won’t even touch that one right now. To be completely fair the noise cancellation works perfectly as does the ambient-noise passthrough feature. Choice. But I want an amazing AUDIO experience. I want my music to more than just “crystal clear.” I want it to be FULL and IMMERSIVE. These fall short terribly of a full high-quality audio experience. I gave 3 stars for battery life because if these are ANYTHING like my 11 Pro, I expect the battery to last less than my older generations of Apple tech, as that seems to be the trend of my luck with them. As someone who listens to a lot of electronic and bass heavy music, I’d like these to perform BETTER than the cheaper older models. I don’t think that’s too much to ask. I mean these are supposed to be a step up, correct? AirPods “Pro”... no “Professional” would use these for ANY type of audio engineering. Apple uses the moniker “Pro” for items they believe will perform exceptionally in areas relative to their items.', 'Sound isolation and water resistance are my favorite features! Was super blown away by how it silences a lot of the noise around me until transparency mode is active! If you want louder headphones than the previous, these are definitely NOT it.', \"Pairs immediately with nice controls. Did not keep long enough to evaluate battery life. Problem is the sound quality is OK, but not what you'd expect for $250. The first generation airpod sound quality is EXCELLENT. The second generation was terrible. Now this third generation is better then the second generation, but nowhere near as good as the first generation. I returned this third generation and went back and bought two used first generation airpods while they are still available. I figure there might never be another airpod that matches it. Also, the noise cancellation is worthless. This is not too surprising. It's really hard to do any serious noise cancellation without over-the-ear coverage.\", 'I bought these for two primary reasons:  Noise cancellation and sweat resistance.  Neither is worth the difference between the cost of the AirPods Pro and the “plain” AirPods.  The noise cancellation feature is practically non-existent.  Try as I might, I could tell very little difference between noise cancellation mode and transparency mode.  Outside noises came through loud and clear in both modes.  It almost seems as if noise cancellation is achieved by stuffing the silicon tips of the AirPods Pro as deeply and tightly in the ear canals as you possibly can.  Some folks ask if they can mow the lawn while wearing these.  Well, of course you can, but don’t expect to hear much unless you crank the volume up to damaging levels. I thought the AirPod Pro was sweatproof.  I was mistaken.  They are sweat resistant.  In the hot and humid South where I live and run, this product will have a short lifespan.  I’m not going to gamble away $235 in hopes simple sweat resistance provides adequate moisture protection.  You would think Apple would develop and release a sports version of AirPods. The sound quality seems about the same as the “plain” AirPods, so I see no reason in keeping the Pro model.  Sorry, Apple.  These are a definite return.', \"This product is not really an apple product and if you purchased apple care with it, you won't be able to use it. I thought I got a great deal on these earpods because they were $20 cheaper than the apple store. Less than a week after purchasing them, the noise cancellation feature stopped working and I kept hearing a wooshing sound and I can tell the equilibrium was not working properly in both earpods. Additionally, the noise cancellation feature would randomly stop working. I took them to the apple store to fix them and they told me that these are actually fake and showed me how the apple database does not recognize them. I asked how I was able to purchase apple care on a fake product and they informed me that the apple care was purchased for a single set of airpods and the serial number was printed on all of the airpods being sold. This is infuriating but I have learned my lesson to only purchase Apple products from the Apple store.\", \"The good: - Sound great- especially compared to other Apple headphones/AirPods!  Bass even!!  Wow!  (That’s why I always was shocked anyone liked other Apple headphones-  zero bass!) -connect to iphone in like 2 seconds -the ability to insert firmly in ear with silicone tips - noise canceling is excellent and like “transparency” mode when you want to hear around you to converse or not get hit by a car. - the ease in connecting to other devices like your iPad or Mac or even Apple Tv -that if you and someone else both have Airpods (any model) you can share connection to phone or ipad to listen together like watching movie, and change volume to each one. The bad: -my right Airpod became defective within 3 months, and I had to contact Apple for replacement (no charge)... that’s crazy fast to go bad, so not much confidence in the build of these. - Battery life is not great (about 4-5 hours) but at least they charge fast.  And the case provides many charge cycles before it’s depleted too. - The largest tips, which fit in my ears great, come loose, especially while jogging, very often and I have to keep pushing them back in ear... (the bass totally goes when they are not snug in ears!) -When I do go to push them back in my ears, invariably I squeeze it by accident, which causes my song to pause, or hangs up the call I am on, and you CANT disable the squeeze control , even though I like to control audio with my phone or watch, not the buds. - I literally have to push them back in my ears like  every 3-5 minutes, so if you are on an hour run, it gets really annoying!!  Especially when it stops song or hangs up call! - For the very high price, it would be great if Apple included a small non-charging case for when you need to pocket them when you don't want to have bulky charging case in your pocket.  Way too easy to lose them without a case!\", 'UPDATE: These are literally designed to have a short lifespan. There is no way to fully discharge the batteries from both the case and the pods as the pods do not work if the case is dead, although they work without the case if you had already started using them. This is to depreciate the lifespan on the product itself. With lithium ion batteries you need to fully discharge between charges for the best battery life. Seems like Apple has designed these in a manner where you actually can’t do so. Pathetic. I really didn’t have crazy expectations for these but they’ve let me down in every way. -Doesn’t even come with a power block to charge the device, because they make you buy it separately. -Sound quality doesn’t match the price tag as it’s very heavy on the bass and mid range but treble is almost non-existent. -Water exposure rating is extremely poor, which won’t be covered by Apple care if you get these wet or too sweaty and they stop working. -Battery life should be better for the price tag as these do not last as long as advertised. -The case is poorly designed as it’s extremely easy to accidentally push the cap backwards which will break it off. -These are designed to be inoperable if they need maintenance or are malfunctioning as the housing is glued together. If you open them up, you’d never be able to put them back together again. -Since these cannot be repaired, it contributes to our global pollution problem as once you’ve reached your max recharge amount and degraded the battery, there’s nothing to do but throw them away and get new ones. Apple really needs to do better. This is just another example of how badly they’ve let these products slip. -No way to locate the device if it gets lost. -No security functions to keep strangers from making it their own if they find it or steal it. -Have to get a case for the case because it scratches insanely easily. What’s the point of designing something to look sleek when you have to put a bulky case on it?', 'Let me clarify before getting into this: I drank the iJuice early on. I’ve always been an iPhone person, had a MacBook for college, and was gifted the first generation of AirPods which I immediately fell in love with. After 2 long, heavily-used years the first pair finally gave out. Bummer, but as a paralegal I had those things in ALL day, every day, and I’d never had a pair of headphones last me that long before. Naturally I was VERY excited to get these, knew they’d be worth the money, and was excited for all the new features. The noise cancellation is STELLAR. I mean borderline dangerous how little I can hear when it’s activated. Easy to switch on and off and the different sized earbuds they come with let you fit them perfectly. Battery life, as most Apple products in recent years, has improved. It’s not mind blowing, but you can get a solid 3 hours of listening, and the case itself will provide roughly 4-6 charges. Now for the iBummer... I ignored other reviews about this. Don’t make the same mistake. Based on other site’s reviews and discussions with others who have bought the Pros, it is an inevitable issue. The left AirPod, man. At first it dropped off here and there. No biggie, just put them in the case, close & open again, all set. It’s Bluetooth, it’s a piece of technology, it’s not perfect. It started happening more and more, but same fix. I became diligent with charging and cleaning them just to be safe (you’re supposed to clean any pair of headphones about once a week but like... come on), even got a case for the case. I figured a more advanced piece of technology would of course require some more careful maintenance. Then one day this frickin’ AirPod disconnected and has NEVER reconnected again. I’ve restarted, reconnected, rebooted, re-everything. I even got the new iPhone (again, drank the iJuice) amidst the month-long “pleasekeepworkingmamalovesyoudontgiveup” phase and hoped that an updated phone would alleviate. Nope. Apple customer service offered to send a new left earbud but they require a nearly $100 “refundable” (I’m sure they’d find a way to keep that) deposit and from what I’ve seen online it won’t make a difference. It makes me wonder if the case itself malfunctions or if it’s just the left AirPod. Anyways... Long story short: WASTE of $250. I’m returning them, it’s just not worth the trouble anymore and if I’m spending $250 on headphones when the phone already comes with a free, albeit corded, pair... I expect them to... work? I try to be understanding and firmly believe we already ask too much of most technology, but if you’re selling headphones they should at least work as headphones.', 'Bought these for a Christmas present for my wife.  Could not believe it does not come with  a wall plug to fit the other end of the lighting plug.  The end that plugs into the AirPods is a standard lightning plug.  The wall end IS NOT a standard USB plug..  it is a USB C plug???? This apple product does not include the wall plug for this to work.  So we are charging our $299 air pods with our IPhone charger. An Apple gimmick to sell something else that should be included in the initial purchase.  What do people do that do not have another Apple produce to do double duty as a charger. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in Apple. Should spend less on their packaging and include the wall plug with the Air Pods', \"I was very excited to try the new Airpods Pro, but unfortunately they are not for me. The main issue was the active noise cancellation (ANC). These were the first pair of ANC headphones I've owned, and it seems that I am in the minority of people who experience a strong negative reaction to ANC. Within moments of turning it on, I experienced head pressure, mild headache, and mild nausea. If you have never used ANC headphones before, be aware that the experience may not be as comfortable or magical as other say. Here is a breakdown of my thoughts on these Airpods: The Good: Fit: The fit was very comfortable and secure. I haven't tried the regular Airpods, but these fit great and seem very secure. Size: Both the Airpods and the charging case are compact and very portable. I have a pair of Bose Soundsport Free headphones and the charging case is at least 3 times larger than these. The mediocre: Sound: Based on reviews, I expected these to sound better. In fact, I thought they sounded worse with ANC on than off. Overall, I think my 2-year-old Bose Soundsports sound better, which is maybe not surprising but a bit disappointing given the price for these. The bad: ANC: Your mileage may vary, but I found using ANC a profoundly uncomfortable experience. I also felt like it did not cancel much more noise than having it off. Both of these factors negate one of the main selling points for these Airpods. Color: The Airpods and the case are dirt magnets. Even using them for less than a day, they were already picking up lots of dirt. I can't see keeping these clean in the long run. Overall: If ANC worked better for me, I could overlook the other shortcomings of these earbuds. As it is, I'll be sticking with my Bose Soundsports and sending these back.\", 'I really wanted to like these. I thought the audio quality of the original AirPods was great, especially if you held them snug in your ear. With the new design, I was hoping the seal would produce the same effect, ensuring high quality sound under all conditions. While they are comfortable and have excellent noise cancellation, I would almost go as far to say the sound quality is the same or worse than the original model. Maybe mine were defective; but, all of my music sounded crisp on the high end and peripherals, while feeling completely empty in the center. It is almost like Apple included an artificial surround enhancer or DSP, by default. Regardless, with the $250 price tag, I was told to expect better. Yes, there are new features and a new design; they are pretty and interface seamlessly with your iPhone. However, if sound quality is your primary concern, I would look elsewhere, or stick with what you have.', 'Double check your airpods. Mine did not come with the Apple plastic wrapping and came with scotch tape and the case and airpods themselves had clearly been used. Had to return them and now I don’t know when I’ll get new ones.', 'I have Bose, Sennheiser and Jaybird bluetooth earbuds, all with the wire.  The Senneheiser\\'s have the best sound. They give me trouble saying \"connecting and disconnecting\" to my iphone so I figured I\\'d buy the Apple product to go with my Apple phone to solve that issue. Pros: It did solve my connection problem I had with other brands.  I also like being able to pop just one earbud in if I\\'m on a call and overall they are very comfortable.  They aren\\'t super loud so I was having trouble using them to listen to a movie on the airplane.  So, I turned on the noise cancellation and voila, they worked great.  I like the noise cancellation and passthrough features. Cons: The fit just stinks.  They use a proprietary silicone ear piece and the large is not large enough.  They fallout when I exercise.  I don\\'t have this problem with any other earbud.  They need to make more options for a better fit but since the earpiece is proprietary, you have zero options.  The sound quality is just above average but at this price point, it should outstanding.  It\\'s not.  Value for the money...its not quite there.', 'The airpods pro is an amazing upgrade from airpods. Now with noise cancellation they cut out the rumbling of your commute and lower the sound of other annoyances. Quality control is lacking though on the manufacturing side (the left one has a sharp edge like it was glued together wrong) Pros: -ANC! -Bass is better than before -works seamlessly with ios -transparency mode sounds very natural Cons: -Sharp edge on the left airpod that seems like a manufacturing error. not present on the right airpod -ANC has difficulties cutting out voices and keyboard clacking. rumblings of HVAC are silenced though.', 'I am very disappointed with this product, it came disgusting. I wasn’t even able to use the AirPods due to the earwax and hair on the actual product. Not only that, but the different sizes for the earbuds were filled with earwax as well. I am utterly disgusted and unsatisfied.', 'This is a counterfeit and no refund was received after the item was returned, please issue a refund immediately.', \"UPDATED REVIEW: 3/9/21 - DO NOT BUY THESE FROM AMAZON! I bought the first pair thinking they were a dud so I gave it another chance and returned them and bought a new pair. I bought them on 2/15 and they stopped working again yesterday, 3/8/2021, less than 30 days later but VERY CLOSE to the 30 day mark (AGAIN). SAME PROBLEMS as before. They don't charge evenly. I have to jiggle them around for the charger to pick up both AirPods, just like the pair before. I thought maybe that was normal and overlooked it. Yesterday, they quit working all together, as the previous pair did. You'll know that they have stopped working when you put them in your ear and you don't hear a sound but it still shows connected to your phone. I have disconnected, reset them, unpaired them, restarted my phone, recharged them, re-paired them, EVERYTHING multiple times and they don't work. The right one gave out first, which makes sense because I use the right one more than the left. Now when I put it in my ear, it's just silence. I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD THEM 30 DAYS!!! I think these are SCAMS because this is my SECOND pair from Amazon to do this and my cousin had the same exact issue with hers from Amazon and ended up buying a new pair from Apple. They also stay connected as if they're in your ears when they're in the case. Totally faulty, no wonder they were $50 off. I will NOT be buying them again from here and will go straight through apple. Don't waste your time or money with these from Amazon because if it's after 30 days, you won't get a refund! PREVIOUS REVIEW: CONSTANTLY having to disconnect, reconnect, forget device, restart my phone, etc. even though they will be CLEARLY connected to my phone and in my ears but when I play sound, it plays out of my phone despite the volume button showing that I'm using my air pods. a complete WASTE of money.\", 'Tengo varias cosas que decir de este producto para empezar este es mi primer AirPods nunca antes avi probado algún otro audífonos de este tipo.

I had the first AirPods which, although didn’t sound great, where easy to use and carry, and I thought had a great microphone. Although the Pros are much better, I’ve always had a problem with them: they fall of my ears. I just got the new Comply 2.0 tips for them yesterday, which prompted me to write this review. By the way, so far, the tips are great. The Pros sound better, and have stayed in my ears. I also have the Sony WF 1000XM3, which, as much as I like them, also fall off my ears. The “ear falling” problem led me to try the Bose. Sound: I tried a number of songs on all 3. I streamed the music from Tidal Hi Fi, so they’re all at higher resolutions.  I’ll list some here: 1. Are you even real? James Blake - this song sounded terrible on the Bose. Muffled to the point that I wonder if these headphones are working correctly. As you might have read, the Bose Music app doesn’t have an equalizer, so there’s nothing you can do on this one. On the AirPods Pro, the song sounded much better than in the Bose. On the Sonys, about 3% better than in the Pros. 2. Blinding Lights - The Weekend - This song came out great in all 3. Edge to Sony over the Bose, but not by much. It sounded tiniest on the Pros. 3. Morning Dance - Spyro Gyra. This is a classic smooth jazz song. The Bose won this round. The song was expansive, lots of small details came out, it was great. I also played a couple of Joshua Redman songs, and I would say the Bose sounded better on those.  I feel that the Bose will probably play better jazz music, if that’s your thing. 4. Malamente - Rosalia. The Sonys won this round going away. Once again, the Bose sounded a bit muffled. Song was good on the Pros, but perhaps a little bit too trebly. 5. Paranoid Android - Radiohead. This song was really good on all 3, Bose was not that far off the Sonys. 6. The Only Thing - Travis. This was another song that the Bose couldn’t play well either. Once again the tinny, muffled sound came up. It felt like i turned the music down on the headphones (I didn’t). Definitely better on the Sony and Pros. Overall, on music playing, I would rate the Sonys number 1, especially if you use Tidal. For my taste, the “360 reality audio” does make songs sound better. The Bose are number 2, but not by much over the AirPods Pro with the Comply tips. The new ios update that added the spatial sound to the Pros with the Comply tips has made, to my ears, a huge difference. In fact, if you don’t listen to jazz, you might prefer the Pros. Microphone/Phone calls I did several blind test calls with my partner, so she could tell me which one sounded better to her. In all tests, she said my voice sounded “about 70% better” (her number) with the AirPods Pro. She said that my voice sounded “feminine” (I’m male) with the Sony/Bose compared to the AirPods Pro. I then tested the Bose and the Sonys with her as well. She said that the Bose sounded better. For the record, I did a call with my parents with the Bose, and they never complained that they couldn’t hear my voice well. They have complained several times with the Sonys (as well as other people). As for hearing phone calls, to my ears, the AirPods Pro sound more natural. I would say that the Bose are second. Phone calls are the Sony’s weakest link. If you want to use the headphones mainly for phones, as much as I love the Sony’s for music, their microphone is just not good. Fit AirPods Pro - the Pros have always felt comfortable to me. However, as I mentioned previously, the Pros routinely fall off my ears. They have fallen when I’m sitting on my desk, when I’m running, walking, or riding a bike. I NEVER had this problem with the original AirPods. The Comply tips arrived yesterday. I want to take them out on a run. For being in the house this past day, they’ve been a huge improvement. I’m glad I bought them. Sony - the Sonys fit comfortably in my ear. However, they will eventually fall off. This happens if I’m walking or exercising. I have to be checking them every few minutes. Bose - I will start with the good: they stay in my ears. I’ve tried them in the house so far, but they’ve been very stable. The bad: 2 things. (1) the tip flies off my ears. The small is too small to do anything. The medium and large just end up flapping, and have to adjust it. It’s very noticeable. (2) They hurt. They stay in my ear, but the seal is seemingly so tight that it hurts my earholes (the biology term is probably the concha). I used to have the old Bose Soundsport wired headphones, and the tip in those was incredibly comfortable and stable. I might be doing something wrong when putting them in, but this will probably lead me to return them. I won’t wear headphones, especially ones at this price, that hurt. Noise Cancelling: 1. Bose - they did a fantastic job with this. I stood next to the dryer, and I could barely hear it. My partner stood next to me to talk to me, and I couldn’t hear her either. If I turned it off to 0, I could hear her, but even then, the seal is so tight that it wasn’t fully perfect. On noise cancelling, these are far and away the best. If that’s the most important thing to you, stop reading the review and order them now. 2. AirPods Pro - I’ve always been amazed at how good the Pros block sound for their size. I’m looking forward to trying them outside with the Complys, as I think it will be even better. However, the Bose are better. 3. Sony - the Sonys block a lot of outside noise as well. I don’t know if it’s better than the Pros, but it’s right there. Hard for me to pick a number 2 here. Conclusion It’s possible that, if the Bose didn’t hurt my ears so much, that they could be the best overall set. I don’t like how some songs sound, but in others, it’s almost as good as the Sonys, which to me, are the standard. I actually have the Bowers Wilkins PX 7s, and I prefer how music sounds on the Sonys.  However, given the pain on my ears, this is how I would rate all of them: 1. Music playing - Sony, Bose, AirPods Pro. 2. Phone Calls - AirPods Pro, Bose, Sony. I will note that I get complaints on voice quality when using the PX7s as well. 3.  Comfort - AirPods Pro with Comply tips, Sony, Bose (VERY last). 4. Noise Cancelling - Bose (by a lot), AirPods Pro, Sony.', 'Best earbuds I’ve ever purchased. For years I wanted wireless noice canceling earbuds after using the beats studios and Bose qc lines. Being an iPhone user I always saw the appeal of AirPods but never could use them due to them not fitting my ear correctly and always falling out. As soon as I saw the design of the AirPods pro I instantly came to amazon and ordered them. If you’re at all contemplating on ordering these I 100% recommend. The noice cancelling is slightly above average and the transparency mode is extremely useful on the go or whenever you need to hear your surroundings with your music. Amazing product definitely worth the steep 250 dollars', 'Compared to the original AirPods, the form factor of the case and the earbuds just look awkward, but the functionality is great. This is the kind of the ugly older brother to the originals that is more powerful. TRANSPARENT MODE To me,the best feature is the “transparent mode” sound. This uses the microphones from the noise cancelling feature to actually pass ambient sound through to your ears while you listen to music or the phone.  It seems like such a small feature, but ultimately, the ability to walk around with full environmental awareness AND music or your phone is pretty awesome. It makes the music presence more like high quality background sound All the time. NOISE CANCELLATION I put these in when I was on a plane alongside my Bose Noise Canceling headphones. The performance was comparable or possibly even slightly better because these seal your ear. Given the match in performance, I’d rather wear these because it’s easier to sleep. SOFT BUD TIPS The soft bud tips aren’t magic, they just work the way all other bud manufacturers have been doing for years. “Oooh, but Apple made them white and...“ nope, just soft tips. Move along. CHARGING Compared to the originals, these function the same. If you have OCD and use your earbuds all day long, you may find they need to go into the case sooner by half an hour or something ... but I’ve seen no real difference in regular “in/out/in/out” daily use. CASE With a millimeter difference here or there, it’s the same size as the original case, rotated 90 degrees. IPHONE INTEGRATION Same special proprietary features as the originals, but the icon looks like a pair of confused ducks. OVERALL I wear them every day, leave them in when I’m not using them and consider them a key part of my work life for phone calls and music. Do they constitute a full upgrade to the originals? Not totally, but somewhat. The transparent sound is the main “wow” feature, and the noise cancellation is solid. If the loose feel of the originals bothered you, the new tips solve that. If you don’t care about the cost of buying new ones so soon after getting the originals, these are a worthwhile improvement on the originals and you’ll be happy. If I lost mine, I’d pay for another pair.', \"The day I received the Apple Airpods Pro, I noticed the connectivity kept going in and out. This lasted a while and didn't go away. After inspecting the buds, I noticed that the black oval on the right earbud was smudged (see picture attached), which is the eat sensor. This explains why the connectivity was going in and out. I contacted Apple Support and looked up the AirPods by serial number on their website, and they confirmed that this product was replaced. I see the seller is Amazon.com, so sure Amazon is letting their vendors fulfill orders. So it's not Amazon's fault, per se, but their sellers should be vetted more closely so this doesn't happen again.\", \"I have only had these for 1 day and I am debating whether or not to return them. I have had every generation of the airpods (e.g. Airpods 1 and Airpods 2). Why did I get these? Well, because I lost my previous Airpods and I was intrigued by the anti-sweat claims of this product. However, I am on the fence as to whether to return them because after about 30 minutes of a hard run, the silicon tips kept coming out. Every time I would try to push them back in it was awkward because I was running fast. What's more, each time I tried to readjust the tips and jam them into my canal (imagine me doing this running a 6:30 mile), I kept hitting the button on the stem and stopping/the music. For the last 10 minutes of my run I just threw the airpods into the treadmill cup. I am now trying smaller buds in hopes that they will work. I will say that the noise cancellation and the transparency mode is amazing. The speaker and sound is superb. But that won't mean much if my main use case (running with these on at high speeds and with lots of sweat) doesn't work. I will update this review in a week or so. UPDATE: I am definitely returning these. The first Apple product that I am extremely disappointed in. The left Airpod fell out multiple times during my run yesterday at high intensity. What is more, the Airpod has started emitting a high-pitched squeak/squeal sound. You can do a Google search on this and many users have complained of this. It appears to be related to the noise cancelling feature and there is definitely a design flaw. I'm disappointed and will be going back to the Airpods 2. I really wanted to these to work, but for serious runners, I would look elsewhere.\", 'I really wanted to like these noise-canceling earbuds. I am completely in the Apple universe, and these seemed like the perfect way to upgrade my headphone experience. The connectivity was wonderful, with the AirPods automatically connecting to the last Apple device you were connected to immediately after taking them out of the charging case. Sound quality was great for music, podcasts, and calls, and the microphone was wonderful for calls too. Noise cancellation was really good for these (obviously) not being over-ear headphones. The battery life was somewhat disappointing, although not worse that what was spec’d. Sure, you get plenty of hours with the charging case, but the AirPods themselves only last 4-5 hours. All that said, I had to return my AirPods after just one week. I have never had any issues with any earbuds fitting my ear, but these would literally cause pain after just 15-20 minutes. I was really hoping that I would get used to them after a week, but the pain only got worse. My ears would feel really sore after a day of using these. All-in-all, I would have absolutely kept my AirPods if they didn’t cause pain. Everything else about the experience was wonderful.', 'Enjoy immersive sound and optimal comfort with the Apple AirPods Pro with Wireless Charging Case, sweat- and water-resistant wireless Bluetooth earphones that use optical sensors and a motion accelerometer to detect when they\\'re in your ears. The all-new, lightweight, in-ear design boasts a customizable fit while providing complete sonic performance. Use Active Noise Cancellation to keep you focused on enjoying your content, or switch to Transparency Mode to stay aware of what\\'s going on in the environment around you. To ensure a rewarding listening experience, the AirPods Pro utilize Adaptive EQ to automatically sculpt the tonal output to suit your unique ear shape. Their custom high-excursion drivers and high dynamic range amplifiers deliver clear, detailed sound with bass down to 20 Hz, all while keeping distortion low and upholding extended battery life. The flexible silicone eartips come in three sizes and advanced algorithms allow the AirPods Pro to analyze the fit and let you know if the current eartip size is giving the ideal seal. Following a single-tap setup, these AirPods automatically turn on and maintain their connection to your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac computer; forget having to manually engage or disengage power. Enjoy music, answer calls, or communicate with Siri on your mobile device without having to pull out your iPhone. These AirPods automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say \"Hey Siri\" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you\\'re on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency. Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge—or 4.5 hours of listening time in Active Noise Cancellation mode, and they\\'re made to keep up with you thanks to a wireless charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time or over 18 hours of talk time. Just 5 minutes in the case gives you approximately one hour of listening time. Charge the case via a Lightning connector or take advantage of its compatibility with Qi mats (available separately) for true wireless charging.', 'As someone who can’t use standard AirPods because they hurt my ears, I’ve been thrilled so far with the AirPods Pro. The adjustable fit is great and they are very comfortable. Sound is incredible considering their small size (even smaller than the standard AirPods!). I’ve tried lots of competitors such as the Jabra Elite 65’s but these are smaller, better, and more seamless than anything I’ve tried. Very happy so far', 'These airpods are wonderful and work very well.  However, I am extremely disappointed that when advertising this product, it was not indicated that it does NOT come with the power adapter that would need to be purchased separately.  I have never purchased any gadget that requires charging and will not come with its charging components.  Now, since Apple and most companies are starting to do this, it is vital to include this information when advertising for your products. Apart from that, these Airpods pro are fantastic.', \"$250!? More like $300+ since you have to provide your own charging brick, they only include a USB-C to Lightning cable and all the other accessories you have to buy to get them to stay put. - Read on for more. The AirPod Pro true failure is their inability to stay in my ears! I have had multiple earphones before with no issues. They  start out okay, do the fit test and get the green check mark but literally a second later I turn my head and out they pop. The Beats X fit perfectly and have many interchangeable sizes that actually stay put. The Bose SoundSport Free has amazing staying power. Why Apple didn't use the tips of the Beats or even some memory foam ones baffles me. As a work around I found these anti-slip silicone covers and they help but not enough and for $250 I shouldn't have to spend another $15 to help them stay in my ear somewhat better. Something that truly bothered me and made me feel like they just don't care anymore is the fact that Apple includes a USB-C to Lightning cable to charge the AirPods but they do not provide a charging brick. So if you don't have a USB-C brick you're supposed to shell out another $30 for that!?!?! On the positive side Apple has done a great job of making sure that if you are in the Apple echo system this is the best way to experience wireless sound. It connects easily not just to my phone but to all my Apple products even my Apple TV allowing me to watch TV without bothering my partner.\", \"As an owner of the 1st gen and 2nd gen AirPods I can honestly say these are worthy of the upgrade.  The ear tips are much more comfortable than I imagined they would be for extended wearing and also hold them in place.  With older AirPods design they would fit but when moving around and even just talking (moving your jaw) they would wriggle from their set position.  Also, I didn't care for the loud sound pressure transferred to your eardrum when tapping to issue commands either of the older generation units.  These new Pro model buds have a pressure sensor on each bud stem you press/pinch to activate features.  They make little single click/tick sound when pressed. One press for Play/Pause/Answer/Hangup, Two-presses for next track, Three-presses for previous track. So far the best feature is noise cancellation which is fantastic.  Calgon, take me a away. The peacefulness is bliss.  The only nag I have so far is with the shorter stem they can be a little fumbly putting them into and getting them out of the charging case.  I haven't had them long enough to test call-quality (both audio and microphone quality) but will update if anything comes up.  I did make sure the firmware updated to latest version as I've heard others speak of microphone call quality with original/shipping firmware version, so I am interested to see if this new version resolves it.  All in all I can highly recommend them and will come back and either bump rating to 5 stars or keep it at 4 Update ~6 month (04/17/2020). Still at 4-stars. All in all a decent upgrade over Gen 2 AirPods and best wireless buds out there I think. Still some software/firmware bugs requiring to put back in case or reset and repairing them to get them working again. Also, microphone voice quality is horrible. On par with gen1 and gen2 AirPods and this is one of the major items I hope Apple targets for the next model(s). Mic noise cancellation is pretty good but voice quality is just lacking. Some would call fidelity of the microphones very compressed and tinny. If you can pick these up for 235+tax they are a decent deal. If they’d get to 199+tax it would be much better.  I still highly recommend them.\", 'the first gen AirPods sound better than these, save yourself some money', 'Not worth the money.  Very disappointed in the noise cancellation.  I’ve worn these on a plane and they only cancel out about 60% of the engine noise.  I occasionally work in a large data center where there’s a consistent equipment hum of about 84 decibels, and I estimate that these are only blocking out about 75% of the noise.  The noise cancellation software needs some serious updating.  The sound transparency mode is pretty good so that you can hear people talking and sounds around you.  There’s just a slight filtering of the sound, so it’s not completely transparent.  Good enough to leave the EarPods in and still hear what’s going on around you. The BIG downside to these are that the EASILY fall out!!  I’ve tried the different sized ear tips, and ran the Air Pods Pro sound/noise cancellation tests and I’m using the correct size tips.  On a plane, I nodded off for a bit and woke up to a missing AirPod.  I had to wait until the plane landed and everyone got off to search for the AirPod.  It rolled a few rows back winding up under a seat with a bunch of garbage and dirt.  On a return trip, I put them in, and within 5 minutes, one fell out again.  Forget about moving around with them in, as they will definitely fall out.  If you bend over, they fall out.  You will find yourself constantly pushing them in to avoid losing them.  I had to buy a silicone strap to keep the two attached to each other so the don’t venture off.  The use of the strap is ridiculous, and shouldn’t be necessary, but I don’t feel like buying a replacement AirPod and wasting more money. The battery charge lasts at least five hours, and charges quite quickly in the included charging case. Overall, save yourself about $200 and spend $50 on a decent pair of wired ear buds, which will have the same audio quality.  A very disappointing purchase!!', \"Connectivity issues abound when connected to Android devices and MacBook Pro.  Constant connection issues.  Can't update FW as I don't have an iPhone.\", 'they do not fit in my ear even with the smallest size ear piece they are still to large. Surprised apple put a product out like this.', 'For the size of it, please do not expect stunning sound quality. But functionally perfect as the previous versions. The noise cancellation is not bad. I used it in my office, most talk from others can be ignored. The only complaint is still the battery. Drain fast and two of them do not have equal amount of juice, which means one is always dead before the other and the noise cancellation function needs two pods to work.', 'Both the Apple Airpods Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds had very good reviews so I decided to purchase both and see which one worked for me. Sound: I have been in audio engineering for 40 years but honestly sound is a very personal thing. Some people like heavy bass while I prefer a genuine full spectrum experience, as if I were sitting in front of a live orchestra. That said, I suspect the Sony earbuds will make the bass aficionado very happy. In my opinion they lacked a full range experience while the Apple was very refreshing making every instrument stand out, even the softest notes. Both had good quality as far as NO distortion even at max volume. Speaking of volume, the Sony could not achieve the same loudness as the Apple. (I should also point out that I was using an Apple iPad Pro as my source device, not that it \"would or should\" make a difference) The Apple also had better clarity most likely because the Sony bass drowns everything else out making it sound a bit muddy. Comfort: In my opinion the Apple wins this one hands down. The Sony is much heavier and seems to run a bit hot as my ears literally burn when I use them. I can\\'t imagine trying to listen long term with the Sony while the Apple earbuds feel very comfortable for the long haul. They both have different size buds that can be interchanged very easily. The Sony has more options and even has two different materials that might appeal to someone who has skin allergy. The down side of the Apple might be that because they are so light it might be easier to loose them however if one the Apple buds fall out, the sound comes to a halt on both which is very nice. Another thing to point out for the athletic type is that the Apple is sweat resistant where the Sony is not. Function and Control: I hate to keep harping on the Sony but once again it mostly fails in this category. One thing the Sony has that I truly like is the ability to pass through external sounds by simply touching and holding the left bud. This also pauses what you are listening to while you attend to the interruption. Once you release your finger it resumes your music or whatever you are listening to. Unfortunately the Sony tap (touch) control for pausing, advancing and changing sound modes are hit or miss at best. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn\\'t making for a very frustrating experience. The Apple has a little microswitch on each bud that consistently works as advertised.  Either left or right bud of the Apple perform the same function while the left and right buds of the Sony have unique functions. The Apple has a seal test that you can run in the app settings to help you get a good fit. UPDATE: After loading the latest firmware the controls are much better for the Sony. No other improvements noted. Carrying Case: On both of these the case function as an integral part of the system. They both have internal batteries that charge the buds while the buds are in the case. The Apple case is a bit smaller and lighter making it the better choice for my pocket. The Apple can also be charged wirelessly or by USB cable where the Sony must use a cable only.  The Sony is more stylish and feels more expensive. I haven\\'t yet tested battery run time but from what I\\'ve read, they are both similar. Summary: Overall the Apple is my pick and makes me very happy. I\\'m sure there are many more options one might consider concerning either of these brands but this is just my experience in a nutshell and I hope it is helpful.', \"Pros: The AirPod Pro are a very good set of earbuds, in fact it’s one of the best I’ve used.  As an iPhone user, I have no complaints on the ease I have with pairing these earbuds with my, as I was able to pair with them with my iPhone in less than a minute, with no effort on my part.  Everything as far as personalizing the AirPod Pro’s ID name, or whether or not if I wanted the earbuds in transparent versus full noise-canceling mode, or even how I wanted to set up how I wanted each earbud to function (e.g. change song, pause, skip, etc.) was super easy. Wireless recharging of the earbuds in their case on a Qi-certified device is a piece of cake.  Simply put the earbuds into your carrying case, and set it on the charging device, and wait for the case color to change to a green light.  Apple does include both three sizes of earplugs and a Lightening Cable to recharge your earbuds and case. The noise-canceling function is good, and does block-out a log of ambient noise.  I haven’t tested how effective they are while traveling in an airplane (which is the true test of noise canceling earbuds), so I can’t rate them as to how effective they are.  I’m sure there’s a ton of YouTube videos, but I can’t personally attest to how well they perform in that specific environment. The earbuds seem to be very resistant to sweat, which is something I like.  I like to listen to music while I work out, I haven’t had issues with AirPod Pro performance while working out for an hour.  I’ve had issues with knock-off AirPods – simply a case of you get exactly what you pay for scenario. Cons: The biggest con of these earbuds is the fit in my ear whenever I exercise.  No matter what size earbud-tip I use when I exercise (i.e. running / aerobics), the earbuds want to fall out of my ears.  I ended up having to purchase a pair of knock-off Bose ProFit earbud attachments from eBay for a few Dollars (see the review photo of what I used), just so these Airpod Pros wouldn’t fall out of my ears while I’m exercising.  The attachments I bought from eBay didn’t help too much in keeping the Airpods in my ears while working-out, but it was a slight improvement over the Apple-furnished earbud attachments.  The security of the earbuds to stay in place while exercising seems to be a design-flaw overlooked by Apple, and I'm surprised their Engineering staff didn't notice this during product development. The other con is the battery life leaves something to be desired.  I’ve been on teleconference calls that lasted slightly over two hours (yes…trust me, I know it's a long teleconference), and gotten iPhone warning notifications of battery life of my AirPods.  That was a little surprising since the AirPod Pros were less than 2 months old, at the time of usage and notification.  This would be a warning I would expect for a device that was either somewhat old, or an inexpensive knockoff you’d purchase at a discount department store.  Granted – I was using noise canceling the entire time of the call, and not the ambient mode to perhaps save some power; however, less than three hours of continuous usage and still getting low battery notifications left me a little disappointed. Overall Rating: I’d still recommend them, despite the few shortfalls of these AirPod Pros.  If you feel noise-canceling isn’t worth the upgrade, the basic AirPods are still a VERY good substitute device to purchase and can save you some money.  The wireless charging is nice, but to me seemed a little bit gimmicky and useless – more so if you don’t own any other Qi-charging capable devices or Qi-charging stations, or if you happen to purchased a silicone protective case for the AirPod Pros to prevent them from getting scratched or damaged.  I managed to purchase these AirPod Pros during an Amazon Black-Friday Sale, so I was able to save some money.  If I were to purchase them at full-price, I would have to seriously weigh whether or not it is worth it,  if I intend to use them for both work and when I go to the gym.  If using only for work, it might be worth it, if I were in a somewhat noisy room whenever I have telecom's (if you have a neighbor using a leaf blower, noise-canceling can only do so much).  If I were only using it for when I exercise, I would have to seriously consider purchasing a set of earbud attachments, so to keep the earbuds from falling out of my ears when working-out.\", 'So, I got a pair the day after they were released for the first time. When I put them on the noise cancelation felt magical. Unfortunately my dog chewed them up two weeks later. Fast forward to last week, when I finally bit the bullet and spent the crazy amount of money on a new pair. For some reason they just didn’t sound the same. A few days ago, I finally came across an article talking about the firmware updates. Apparently, This is something that happens automatically and Apple really botched it. It’s completely destroyed the noice cancelling capabilities and once it is updated it can’t go back. I’ve lost all trust in Apple for keeping this quiet and refusing to rectify the situation or address it in any way.', 'These earbuds are an ENORMOUS ripoff. More often than not, at least one of them doesn\\'t charge while in the case, even if I clean it out with a cotton swab first. Rarely do both connect to my phone/watch/Peloton at once - most of the time I only have sound out of one ear. If you sweat, they slip and fall right out with the slightest movement (end yes, they are snug in my ear when dry). Forget about using them with a Peloton or other piece of equipment unless you force your iPhone to \"Forget\" them first; the Apple connection overrides all else and won\\'t let you switch to a different device. Then when you go to pair them to your phone again, have fun with that. It typically takes me at least 4 or 5 tries before my iPhone will acknowledge their existence in order to pair up. Earlier this week I had to try TWELVE times, and finally rebooted my phone and did a hard reset on the earbuds to get them connected again. Alas, the left earbud, though showing 100% charge, is now completely dead - no sound out of it for the past 10 days.. These pieces of crap lasted less than a year. I\\'m off to buy some Powerbeats Pros instead and hope they fare better.', 'After months of itching, crusting, leaking, a trip to urgent care, an ER visit and ultimately an ENT appointment, I figured out my problem is an allergic reaction to the air pod pros.  I am frustrated because as a long time Apple user I never had any issue so it was well after the ability to return them date that it was figured out. I have been reading others having the same issue... if we can’t return them, those who have suffered should come together for a class action suit.', \"These worked fine for a month or two, but then a crackling noise began in the left airpod. Everytime I move and occasionally even when staying completely still distracting noise will begin. For a top-of-the-line pair of earbuds these are surprisingly flimsy. They were serving their purpose but two months of regular use before breaking is unacceptable. As a side note, don't expect these to cancel out sound. They'll dull the ambient noise; if a TV is on in the background you'll hear it clearly.\", 'I wish I could give more than five stars. I’m a very picky person when it comes to what sounds are flooding my ears and I tell you, I’ve owned Bose and thought those were the game changers. I was more than pleasantly surprised at how these sound and fit. I’ve never used any Apple products in my ears, especially with the price of Apple nowadays. These are hands down the best ear buds I’ve ever owned! They stay perfectly in place through some rigorous working out as well!', 'Noise cancelling means tight fit - that achieved with soft silicon tips. Even with pressure regulators for equalizing internal and external pressure  the tight fit is uncomfortable, sounds travel through you body and you hear low frequency impact every time you make a step.  I have tried every size silicon tip, but it did not help. Sound quality is not even close to the free set included with iPhone. It useful when you need to make a short call in a room full of people...', 'I bought these for my girlfriend. Unfortunately, she has smaller ears, so the largeness of the white plastic piece, not the interchangeable silicone pieces, feels uncomfortable after short term usage. Even for me, the largeness of the ear bud starts to feel uncomfortable after an hour or so. They at least stay in when exercising. The noise canceling helps but doesn’t completely block out external noise. You can still hear the subway, people talking, etc. There is a high pitch squeal, like feedback, that occurs when lying your head down on the AirPods Pro. One forum said it’s likely mic feedback from the noise canceling. I also noticed that with an iPhone 6, the AirPods Pro would cut out occasionally. Oddly, it was when I was walking and my hand would hit my phone in my pocket. I probably won’t buy this shape of true wireless headphones when purchasing in the future, unless they are able to reduce the ear bud size or improve its comfort. I do appreciate the compact recharging case, addition of the silicone ear piece, reduced profile of the external control stems, and the control functions and stable communication with my iPad 7 and iPhone 11.', \"I got these as a pre-order on amazon, and when they arrived I instantly began to love them. Now you may think im weird for using these with my google pixel 3, but I have tried samsung gear iconx and jaybirds x3 in the past, and neither were a suitable option for me, despite their good passive noise cancellation. I love the active noise cancellation on these airpods, and it makes tasks such as leave blowing and other loud low tone things much more tolerable. !!!!!ANDROID COMPATABILITY!!!!!! I am amazed at how quick these were to pair with my android phone. This may be a new thing apple has allowed, I dont know, because these are my first pair of airpods. Connection is almost instant, and the airpods pro are always connected by the time I get them in my ears. Also, noise cancellation works and so does ambient mode of course. I have an iphone as well, but it is old. I used this iphone for the sole purpose of doing apple's proprietary fitment test, to see if I should change my eartips. On android hey google works, and I was surprised at how strong the connection signal, sound quality, and ease of use are on these airpods pro. I would highly recommend these airpods, because despite being on android, they are a very seamless experience, and once you hear the surrounding worlt melt away with the nosie cancellation, the steep price should no doubt be justified!!!!!!!\", \"I was hesitant to purchase these, becasue there wasn't data to support how many decibels the noise cancellation actually cancels. I still don't know how much it cancels out, but I love them! I wear them when driving a no cab JD 4010 tractor wide open. It blocks most of the tractor noise out, and I don't even have to have the volume turned up high. I also wear them while driving the skid steer. It does a great job of blocking out the back ground noise. If someone calls me while on a very loud tractor, I can hear them great, but they have trouble hearing me, which is totally understandable. I can have conversations with people while in the skid steer. The skid steer doesn't run too loud that people can't hear me during conversation. These airpods are very handy. I work in construction, and it is very convenient to be able to walk around the job site and talk on the phone without having to have my phone in my hand. Another great benefit is that I can leave my phone on the charger and walk around my house talking to someone on the phone. I also wear them while walking or jogging. I live in the country and don't have side walks to walk on. I walk/jog down the road. Even with the noise cancellation I can still hear most all vehicles when they are coming from behind. I've only been startled a few times. I really love that the airpods charge in the case, so you can get many hours of use, before you actually have to charge the case. My only compliant is that if I am talking on the phone without the airpods and then put one or both in my ears, it does take several seconds for it to connect to the airpods. During that time it will flip between the airpods and the phone and it can be confusing for the person you are speaking to. It does best when I put the airpod in before I answer the phone.\", \"I have been an Apple geek since 2004. Since Jobs' demise, quality control has declined precipitously as evidenced by increased numbers of defective units making it onto sales floors (& Apple refusing to stand behind them, from numerous expensive experiences). This is yet one more example of a unit that should not have reached the sales floor (defective). Had this unit since end of April. In 4 mos. I went from zero knowledge to expert at troubleshooting: syncing problems, charging problems, cleaning, unpairing/pairing, syncing/resyncing all for the Left ear bud. Mine is constantly (several times a week) not working. At all. My phone (XR, updated) cannot recognize it. I know little about actually using these for sound as I rarely get to. I spend many hours researching & fixing, maybe 1 listening then back to fixing. Honestly my experience with this particular unit has been bad to poor. But the small amount of time I get to listen? Not as good as my Bose cans for bass but very good sound quality for buds. Just the pesky issue actually getting to use them for sound & not as a tutorial to become an Air Pod technician. If you get a good unit, I've heard the experience is awesome. But like all Apple products post-Jobs it's hit or miss.\", \"The Pros are so much better than previous Airpods: -  Fit:  The small pads that come with the Pro fit perfectly and don't budge even when running. The default size of the old Airpods were too big for my ears and they were always falling out. - Comfort: I can wear these for hours and forget they're there. The old Airpods hurt my ears after an hour or so of wear. - Sound quality: Better fidelity all around, especially in noise canceling mode. No comparison to the old Airpods. - Noise canceling: Crazy good - if it's on, don't expect to hear any outside noise at all. Not available with the old Airpods. - Transparency mode: Perfect blend of being able to hear what's going on in the larger environment while still listening to music/calls/audiobooks, etc. comfortably. Easy to switch between transparency and noise canceling. Not available with the old Airpods. - Battery life: Delivers long life as promised, and charges quickly. I was constantly having to use a single earpiece with the old Airpods while the other was charging if I wanted to use them for an extended period. Price is the one major downside. If you can afford the Pros without breaking the bank, I'd say go for it.\", 'Occasionally, one of the AirPods fails to charge which is super annoying considering the price and I\\'ve only had them less than 3 months. I then realized that the battery percentage was also not showing on my iPhone. I tried to rectify this by disconnecting them from bluetooth and then reconnecting. BIG mistake. They will not reconnect now. After hours of troubleshooting and talking with 3 representatives at Apple Care, I still cannot connect. I would take them into Apple Store and let the \"geniuses\" work on it but there are no open appointments for weeks. I finally agreed for them to send me a replacement (while also putting a $277 hold on my credit card) - but then learned replacement is a refurbished unit. I think that\\'s totally unacceptable to give me a used product, not due to my mistake but theirs. Sure if I lost this pair that would be on me and that\\'s where refurbished might make sense. They will not budge, so I scrapped that idea. So now I guess I\\'ll have to wait weeks for an appointment. Unfortunately, I cannot return them since I did not purchase from Apple but instead here on Amazon which has 30 day limit. I told Apple Care supervisor they are losing a long time customer entrenched in the Apple ecosystem (I have the AirPods, MacBook air, iPhone - and would\\'ve bought an iPhone12 in a few weeks when it comes out). She couldn\\'t care less. Faulty product and Apple Care is worthless.', 'This is a fake!!! Did not come in shrink wrap and the contents inside the box aside from the AirPods were flimsy. The box was dirty. No charging cable and there were orange crumbs. I Immediately returned as soon as I opened it. The packaging was cheap and not typical of Apple. Do not buy!!!', 'I\\'m sitting here kind of chuckling to myself. I went from being AMAZED at the Pro\\'s (although if they slightly slip out of your ear, ANC goes to crap), and loving every second of using them, to feeling like they\\'re a burden and not worth putting in. Long story short, after ~4 months of bliss, the right Airpod has been malfunctioning. It sounds like the microphones that are used for ANC (or one of the other mics) is actually picking up reverberations from inside the earpiece, and causing massive amounts of feedback. Apple should be covering it by warranty, so I\\'m hesitant to leave such a bad review, but it feels like such a silly design flaw. Secondly, I got a new job, and my company uses Windows computers. This is the real kicker, and this MAY reflect more on Windows than anything-- but the connection is horrible. Sometimes I connect the earpiece and it sounds like I\\'m listening to sound through a tin can, and I have to disconnect and reconnect to get normal sound back. But sometimes cycling the connection like this causes them to stop working entirely, and I have to cycle the connection several times more to get them to work again. Now I\\'m sitting here, looking at my Airpods, with several upcoming meetings through Microsoft Teams, thinking \"I would much rather move to a quieter room in the house than deal with putting in my Airpods\" It went from the most blissful, user friendly experience with great call quality, to having one working Airpod that only SOMETIMES connects to my computer. Depending on the diagnoses from Apple I\\'ll update my review.', 'So these AirPods are everything Apple claims to be. I love the functionality. However, after two months the right pod developed a crackling sound during medium to high volume. Being an Apple product evidently Amazon will only cover 30 days. So I had to go to Apple for help. Bottom line it cost me $89 for a replacement. That’s how Apple plays. And that is why I gave this one star.', 'When reviewing these, I considered three fators: Sound quality, comfort, Apple\\'s newer innovations, and cost. Sound quality is surprisingly good and much better than the original Air-pods.  I am an audiophile and also play classical guitar.  I look at sound from the high, middle, and lower range.  These are excellent in the total spectrum.  The younger generation probably want\\'s more bass, but, I found the sound to be clear, pleasant, and accurate.  They are pleasant to the ear. As for comfort, the ear pads are soft and mold very well inside the ear.  They also fit well and are not inclined to fall off. I like the new innovation of listening with or without noise cancellation.  I tested both, and in my car I could eliminate the sound of my diesel Mercedes Benz engine and all outside sounds.  Granted, that is not a safe way to drive.  I also thought it might be a nice way to tune out my wife, which i can pretty much do anyway. As for the cost, well, just wait a few weeks or months.  The price continually drops, and you can buy them from Amazon, Costco, etc. with nice discounts.  I will probably buy a second pair within a few months, as it\\'s nice to have them in my car and in my office. Someone said to not buy them from Amazon, and I have to disagree.  if they are \"refurbished,\" perhaps that is true.  But Amazon has tremendous customer support and replaces or refunds almost without question.  And they are tough to beat on price. There is a big difference between these and the first generation Air-pod.  I think it\\'s worth the extra money, and I will probably buy another set soon.', 'These were ordered for me by my husband a birthday gift.  However when we received them one ear bud did not work at all despite attempting several times to troubleshoot the issue.  Absolutely zero sound.  Ok, fine not a big deal.  So we start the return process and Amazon sends us a new pair that work fine. I send back the original set exactly how it was sent to us.  Fast forward to a couple weeks later and we get an email from Amazon stating that they have received the package but with one of the airpods missing from the package.  Now I am 100% CERTAIN THAT I PUT ALL PIECES BACK IN THE BOX WHEN I SENT IT BACK.  My assumption is while the item was in transit it was opened and the working ear bud was taken.  Amazon has continued to insist that we will be charged an additional $209 for the product when IT WAS THEIR FAULT THAT WE WERE SENT A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT in the first place.  I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON!!  Get it from a store instead!  Also an FYI that we think the original AirPods we got were used.', 'After purchasing a pair of cheap, off-brand wireless headphones off of Amazon that were terrible - I decided to spend the money on some Apple AirPods. These are soooooo much better than the cheap ones I originally ordered! Pros: - Great noise cancellation - Impressive sound quality - Charging cable for AirPods is the same cable as the newer iPhones - Maintains a long battery life Cons: - Pairing my phone to the AirPods can be tricky at times. Have not yet been able to master how to easily switch between car phone/Bluetooth to AirPods. Or how to switch from one AirPod bud in to using both buds during the same phone conversation. In time, I’m sure I’ll figure it out! - The AirPods come with 3 sets of ear cushions of varying sizes. However even when using the smallest option of ear cushion, it’s still too large for my ear. Because of the fit, these have fallen out of my ears a few times and I’m constantly having to push them back in. I am now looking to purchase additional ear cushions that will be a better fit for me Overall, the Apple AirPods Pro are a good investment and I’d recommend these', 'Bought these thru the Apple Store on Amazon because our local Apple Store seems to be indefinitely closed due the pandemic. The necessary  noise canceling feature is what keeps my peace n sanity. Yard work is already a pain but when u hv neighbors so close jabbering away constantly all u hear is their annoying conversations. The regular Apple earbuds weren’t cutting it. 🤪 Now, it’s like meditating while listening, fully engaged in Spotify. Omg, it is a must have for sure. No exaggeration. As for comfort, for me, I barely feel them. There were a few times, a pod would fall out but then u’ll immediately notice so u can hunt it down. I noticed it happens when it’s not sitting angled down. U’ll hv to figure your secure position. After having for less than a month, only one day for some unknown reason, the batteries drained as tho I had bn using it all day but I didn’t. Maybe it was because I’d take my iPhone out of my pocket n leave it on the ground? Don’t know. But, so far so good. Still, it freaked me out since now I can’t live w/out it. After reading the reviews on purchasers buying the AppleCare w/the AirPods on Amazon n not having any record of the AppleCare purchase, I decided to buy it separately either going to Apple store, online  or calling. Shucks, the store seems like it’s indefinitely closed so I went to the site to buy online BUT after so many attempts it would not let me buy the coverage. “This device is not eligible for additional coverage.” 😖😫 I’m thinking did I buy it from a third party who bought it n is reselling it?!??? A cortisol panic moment. APPLE:  YOU HV GOT TO GET YOUR AMAZON STORE SET UP RIGHT. Long story short, call Apple DIRECTLY to walk u through purchasing AppleCare to avoid high insulin induced cortisol. See photo for number or go to Apple’s contact site.  I was told the “purchase” date was not entered (I guess by the “seller” or Amazon warehouse on behalf of Apple). I’m sure lots of buyers are having the same problem. A senior Apple employee helped me with her soothing😆 character n now I am rocking again. Hopefully my batteries will keep the charge a long time but if it doesn’t I think having it two years working nonstop is a good deal n if it doesn’t keep for two I now hv AppleCare to the rescue.', 'I was impressed by the sound quality.  They were much better than the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 2 which people rave about.  They integrate seamlessly into the Apple eco system, which is great for iPhone users.  Unfortunately, they would either slip out of my ear (almost lost one on a walk), or they would feel like they were slipping out of my ear, despite trying the various size earbud adapters.  I especially like how you can share your audio, as my fiancée and I did on a walk.  I tried some 3rd party earbud adapters, which fit better, but weren’t as comfortable.  Apple - why just put a soft loop around the ear like Bose and Beats and be done with it?  At the end of the day, it was too unnerving walking around with expensive electronics in my ear never knowing when I might lose them.  I returned them.  I hope they’ll have a more secure design with the AirPods Pro 2.  Of you cruise the internet, you’ll see a number of people experience the same problem.  Also, the noise cancellation didn’t knock my socks off.  However, transparency mode was really nice.  I hated to admit it, but with transparency mode and audio sharing, you almost don’t need a home sound system, as good as these sound.  I just wish they’d stay in my damn ear.', \"They are a little less comfortable than the regular Airpods, you really to wedge them into your ear.  But the noise cancellation is awesome and worth it. The problem is that over time the seal will go bad (you will not be able to get a good fit when doing the seal test), and i think the microphone blows out.  When there is a loud sound (like when i clear my throat), and noise cancellation (or transparency) is on, there is a loud crackling/buzzing sound.  Only with noise cancellation or transparency on though, which leads me to believe there is an issue with the microphone.  i am currently going through my second warranty replacement with these. The noise cancellation is great and worth the extra money, but if it keeps breaking I'm just going to go back to wearing my regular airpods.  Without the noise cancellation they are not as comfortable and there is no point.\", \"I recently made the switch from a good-quality brand that I was happy with, but I got a good deal on the AirPods Pro that I originally wanted, and picked them up. Holy moly, I really liked the off-brand version quite a bit.  They have good sound, come in black (I wish I could get that in the AirPods Pro.  I prefer less conspicuous and you look like a dolt walking around with bright white buds in your ear), so a black version would be nice.  The battery life in the off-brand earbuds and in the charging case are both far and above superior to the Apple product.  So, that one has black color and way superior battery life going for it.  But that's it. The first time I put the AirPods Pro in and listened to music, I was *immediately* blown away by the sound difference.  I mean, I thought the off-brand were good (and they are), but these are absolutely, positively incredible with sound.  The transparency mode is also very, very good.  The microphones pick up the sound around you and you can hear it in your ear.  So, driving my older vehicle without a decent stereo in it is no problem.  I can listen to music or podcasts and still hear what's going on around me. Calls are fantastic.  Pairing is fantastic.  It will switch between all your apple devices without a hitch:  computers, laptops, iPad, iPhone, and even the AppleTV!  It's amazing. I absolutely love these.  If battery life was just a little better (5 hours tops, vs. 9 hours on my off-brand.  Off-brand case has like 34 hours, and Apple is.... less), they'd be absolutely perfect.  I'm giving 5 stars either way, but battery life could be improved.  Still totally worth it, though.\", \"admit - general performance of the AirPods Pro is very good: sound; features; and, functionality. however, I have decided not to keep them after 1 set, followed by a replacement - both with the same problem. the issue is that the right earbud continues to discharge, even when not in use / even when sitting idle in a fully charged case. this problem was reported in earlier versions with comments/solutions as early as 2018. But my units were fresh, newest version units from 2020. - the common solution from Apple: reset the units., which had no effect on resolving the issue. it seems to me that Apple, great as it is, has slipped on this one - whether the buds or the case - it's hard to say. but for $200 (sale price), i should not have 2, let alone 1, problematic units with the same defect. still a believer in Apple products, but AirPods Pro let me down - twice!\", 'If you’re on the fence about spending this much on ear buds like I was and are reading reviews for that reassurance about some feature and wonder if it’s worth it, believe me it is! I tried the good knockoffs with good sound, unintentionally I might add and there’s no comparison. If you want more freedom from reaching for your phone or tapping your earbuds to change a song or pause and want to be completely hands free then you’re going to be in heaven. For me these are exactly what I what I need for work and at home because I can control my music hands free, make calls and all the other great things Siri does for you completely hands free. I’m in love with these things! This is my first pair of AirPods so I can’t give you a comparison from the previous generation but, they sound amazing! Crystal clear, deep bass and I could not ask for more. They sound better than I thought they would to be be honest. I wore them for a few hours straight today working outside and I was surprised at how well they stayed in place and how comfortable they were. Also the distance! I had my phone on a table in the back yard and walked to the front to my car and they didn’t cut out a bit. There was brick house was between me and my iphone so it wasn’t line of sight. I’m not sure the exact distance but, it was further than apple claims. As for the transparency mode all I can say is wow! It’s so much better than I thought it would be. You really do have to hear it to believe how great it is. I can pause music and keep them in and watch tv, carry on a conversation or anything I would normally do. They are that clear. I can barely tell a difference when taking them out. As for being able to use them as hearing aids like people wonder; uh, no not quite there yet. You can use your live listen on your iPhone and probably cheat and use it that way. It’s pretty clear in that mode and doesn’t echo but, it’s no replacement for hearing by far. Kind of distant sounding but, it would better than nothing. I’m sure live listen will sound about the same as it does on previous AirPods. What I found shocking was even in high wind in transparency mode there was no distortion of sound at all. I was worried since it has an external mic that it might but, nope it sounded great and just like normal. Noise cancellation is pretty good too. It doesn’t cut out 100% of noise but, enough to make a huge huge difference. Probably be good if someone in your house blaire’s the tv where it’s tolerable. For being little earbuds and having both noise cancellation and transparency you can’t ask for more. On call the mic seems to be clear on the other end as well and on dictation. Much better than other brands I’ve had for sure. In short, if you’re an apple lover and want some great sounding, super comfortable Apple earbuds or just want to go hands free with your iPhone and music you’ll be glad you got these!  On a side note... To Help people from getting scammed by other stores like I did; here’s one simple way to tell if you’re AirPods are real or not; each AirPods Pro earbud weighs 5.4grams. Most knockoffs weigh around 3.1 to 3.8g If you buy them from anywhere besides Amazon or an authentic trusted Apple retailer and wonder if they’re real or not, then throw them on the scale. That’s the one thing they haven’t mastered is the weight and Siri. Siri should work out of the box by voice and if you’re having problems, hear static in transparency mode or can’t find your AirPods in general> about settings then you might want to check them out on the scale because there’s some good clones out there right down to the packaging, print on the earbuds that look authentic with serial numbers and all but, none I know of have voice control with Siri or sound half as good as these. I apologize for the long review but, I’m hoping to help someone and save them hours of researching and looking like I did and from getting scammed. Have a wonderful day!', 'very good sound quality, and i bought one for my friend alright!!!', 'I\\'ve had these for about a month now, and I can give the following review with confidence: These are great for the average person. They\\'re very comfortable, stay in well for a jog, and the sound quality and features are all great. Pairing and connectivity to the iPhone is smooth, as expected. The fit is excellent, I think it was nice touch including different sizes of ear gummies. I personally use the smallest ones. You can wear them pretty much all day without discomfort. The active noise cancellation -- They work, but they\\'re not perfect. This features blocks out every day noises pretty well, and in conjunction with the audio from whatever you\\'re listening to I\\'d say they drown out outside noises very well; I wouldn\\'t go as far as to call it \"noise cancelling\" though. I\\'d say half the time they actually completely cancel noises, and the other half they\\'ll muffle noises enough to make it easy for you to ignore and focus on whatever you\\'re listening to. Overall, they\\'re excellent. I do not consider myself an audiophile. As an average user, I\\'d say I am beyond happy with the results. The transparency mode -- I think this is underrated. It is amazing for when you\\'re goin on jogs, as it allows you to enjoy your music while still being aware of your surroundings. I also enjoy that because you can hear yourself better, you speak at a more reasonable volume on the phone. I find myself speaking regularly instead of shouting during phone calls because I can tell that I\\'m speaking at a normal volume. I\\'m not sure if anybody else feels the need to talk louder with headphones / earphones in because their own voice is muffled, and they don\\'t think they\\'re speaking loud enough...but if you are, I hope you can relate to this tangent. The mic -- Good enough. I haven\\'t been told that I sounded weird over the phone. No complaints on clarity of my speech either. Overall, great headphones. Comfortable, definitely an upgrade from the first gens I had. The features are great for an average user; I use both the transparency and noise cancellation modes all the time. Would definitely recommend it for everyday use. If you do extreme work outs or are an audiophile, maybe you won\\'t enjoy these as much.', 'The AirPods Pro have exceeded my expectations. Audio quality is excellent. Highs and mids are superb while the lows/bass are very good. Important, a very good fit of the tips are critical for bass performance. If the included tips aren’t quite right, pay an extra 20 to a third party seller for more fit size options. Also, if Apple tips feel uncomfortable, pay the extra for different tips. You want them to feel comfortable being in your ears for hours if needed. You’re paying for premium devices, pay a bit more IF needed to make them just right. As expected from Apple, the setup is easy, almost non existent. Maybe the tip fit test, it took a few tries for me to get right. But I wanted it just right and played with it. I highly recommend trying one size up and one size down testing to get it just right. With just the right fit the audio performance is a step further next level. You’ll only get audio better than this quality with a very very expensive sound system or similar true wireless such as Sony. Auto routing is very handy if you have Apple ecosystem devices. Listen to TV audio that is hi def sound using these. Incredible listening! Phone calling quality is also very good. Use just one AirPod to double battery life for phone calls. Be aware, Bluetooth devices pic up small close ambient sounds. Don’t be washing dishes while using this for s phone call. One item that knocks rating down slightly, the only EQ customization will be dependent on the application. Apple Music app has EQ presets. Good but not as good as it could be. The iPhone software doesn’t have an EQ built in. Hopefully that will come in an update. But that’s a very small knock on it. Also, If you can afford the 8 to 10 dollars a month, I recommend Apple Music or Spotify for best in class music quality (maybe Amazon music too - no experience with it though). I like the stems and stem touch. But stem control is the one thing you will have to get used to using. It took me about a week to get used to using it after customizing it. Great device, great audio, great price and delivery from Amazon.', \"I want to start off by saying I am not a huge Apple person which this product is mostly aimed towards. I have a mix of products with different operating systems; I have a Google Pixel phone, an iPad, and a Windows PC. These earbuds luckily work with all of these products pretty flawlessly with occasional hiccups on Windows, though of course they work the best with my iPad. I got these on sale for $170 because personally the $250 price tag was just too much for me, and at this price they are a steal. I would say if you can get these for $200 or lower they are well worth the cost. Pros: - Sound. Sound quality is really good for most music. I'm a bit of a bass head so I don't get the fullest experience I would like out of these, but I still enjoy the clarity of the music. I did not get these specifically for bass, as I knew they would not be bass-heavy, which is why this is still a pro for me. If you listen to lots of hip hop or indie music these sound great. - Features. The ANC on these is not the best, but you should not expect the best from little earbuds at this cost. These block out my loud air conditioner and a lot of other white noise with a consistent sound wave. These do not block out loud sudden noises like typing or people conversing, though they do a good job quieting things down through noise isolation from a good seal. Transparency mode on these is amazing as well; with them on, it really sounds like there is nothing in your ears (except your own voice will sound slightly muffled to you). I am continuously amazed by how well transparency mode works and I can see the use cases for them only building. - Comfort. Honestly, with the relief of pressure Apple put into these with the little vents on the bottom of the AirPods, I forget these are in my ears. They are so comfortable to wear, which says a lot for someone with small, sensitive ears. This may differ if these don't fit your ears properly, which I will mention later. - Portability. The charging case is nice and compact, and even with a silicone case on top of it I can easily slip them in small pockets of bags and in large pockets. The AirPods themselves are quite small and I can see someone misplacing them if they lay them down somewhere and forget about them, but they're bigger than a lot of other TWS earbuds I've owned so hopefully I will be able to keep track of them. - Seamlessness with Apple products. AirPods are, of course, Apple made. Therefore they are designed to work with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Macbooks. These pause and play instantaneously with my iPad and I can access all the special features you get specific to Apple. - Presentation. Apple wins on sleekness. Not much else to say about that. Medicorities: - The fit of these is pretty good for the average ear, but if you have smaller ear canals like me they can be just a little troublesome. My left ear canal is almost too small for the smallest tip of these, but with maneuvering I can still get a good seal. They fall out if I lay on my arm in bed, but other than that they stay in. Definitely try all the earbud sizes. - The magnet for the lid of the case is pretty sturdy though not super strong, so I find it sometimes opens when I carry them around. This doesn't happen too often but be aware of that. Cons: - Price. As I stated before I don't think these are worth $250. I think $200 is just right for them, and the extra $50 is simply paying for the Apple branding. This is why I'm not a huge Apple fan. - Not seamless with non-Apple products. If you only use Apple, these will work great for you so disregard this point. I didn't expect these to work with everything, though an Android app would be nice. If Samsung can make an app for their Galaxy Buds for iOS devices, I think Apple can do the same for Android. I have connection issues on occasion with my Windows PC, and taking out and AirPod does not in any way auto-pause/play on Windows nor Android. All stem pressing functions do work as they are supposed to though. This is a mix between a mediocre feature and a con for me. Tl;dr I think that the pros outweigh the cons for the AirPods Pros, and I recommend them for anyone looking for great sound with any device. Apple could be a little more friendly to those who don't buy everything Apple, but from a competitive standpoint I get it. I can see myself using these on a daily basis and I think they are a great buy if you can get them under $200.\", \"Brutally honest edits 1. They’ve been great in every way, but they fall out when I try to stuff an entire slice of pizza into my greedy mouth. ______ After owning them for about a month: Yeah... I’d give five stars, but this is really more of a 4.5 star review because of volume control. This is as close to “doing it right” as wireless earbuds currently are. Four stars because having volume control on the buds themselves would be great. But they’re really low-profile, which I need them to be in my main setting, so I don’t mind the trade. ______ Two weeks of ownership. I’m noticing some hiccups when playing music, but I’m also in a warehouse setting that’s like a saturated signal trap inside a faraday cage. It’s likely my internet connection. Second note, the ultimate test: they’re comfy enough that I’ve fallen asleep in them, when my upstairs neighbors have had their tv off. It’s on now, at a low to medium disturbance (low enough to sleep unless you get anxious easily like me, but even if you don’t, you wouldn’t sleep like a baby at my neighbors’ volume). Well, noise Cancellation is flawless! _______ Day 1 I just got these today, and my rule was that they had to be better than JBL Tune 120s in every way (which shouldn't be hard to do). Addressing the problems of my JBL's, the AirPods gave me trouble finding a good seal at first. So I just tried playing music anyway. The quality was really good, and then I toggled to find out that Noise Cancellation wasn't on. When it turned on, wow. I had to test it a few times by snapping my fingers with it on/off, and then I wasn’t sure if I was actually hearing my snap or just the AirPods’ sound of it with Passthrough. I’m also hearing elements in music that I had previously not heard, even in songs I’ve loved and listened to deeply for more than a decade! Not only are those great features, but each AirPod can function exactly the same, whether I have only the left in or the right. Two squeezes, three, hold, on either of them. They didn't split controls so that the right does some, and the left does others. I've not tested voice control in my usual setting with these yet, but I doubt they'll be as garbage as the JBL Tunes. EDIT: voice control under a beanie in a loud warehouse setting is mostly flawless. And “mostly” means Siri didn’t hear me very well at the moment I had some metal (objects, not music) clanking near me, so I forgive her. Highs and mids are nice, bass is lacking just a little bit (but not at all to a disappointing degree), and I suppose the seal is good. It doesn't feel like the seal is good, and I’ve settled on medium tips, but they feel sturdy in-place, and the sound quality suggests that I do have a good seal even if I don't feel what I'm used to with silicone tips. This product may change in a few weeks or months, and I'll put the brutally honest edits at the top of this initial review, and the good edits will be added near their initial notes. But so far, these work, and I know Apple isn't as loose with the quality behind their name as JBL is. I don’t think your lifestyle is as regularly loud and disruptive as my daily life, so I think it’s safe to say that if they work well for me in my rough setting, they’re friggin awesome when I’m off the clock, even and especially when I’m falling asleep!\", 'Brief history: I’m old and I have had more headphones than some people are old. These are incredible and I have only been listening for about an hour. BTW THEY FIT IN THE WATCH POCKET OF MY LEVIS! DAY 5: Still love these AirPods!  I wear them almost constantly to listen to music and answer the phone.  Music is great for such small devices with some pretty nice Bass pressure with the noise cancelation on.  The transparency mode is really nice and the complete noise cancelation is as good as can be expected without ear cups. I changed the ear tip to the large size and they stay in my ears much better.', \"$200 for wireless earbuds that don't stay inside my ear for longer than five minutes, no matter which tips I use, even if I'm sitting still. One star may seem overly harsh, but I shouldn't have to keep turning to third-parties to find fixes and solutions for Apple products. [Update] Having had a chance to actually use these now that I have a third-party solution for the fact that they don't fit, I'm still not impressed. Noise Cancellation: 3/5 stars. The active noise cancellation is hit or miss. Certain sounds it's fairly good at filtering out, while others seem to pass through completely unhindered. My old Bose noise-cancelling earbuds performed far better across the board. Sound Quality: 4/5 stars. When they're actually seated properly inside your ear (and stay there) they sound fairly good. Certainly not audiophile good (as if they wouldn't turn up their nose at anything wireless in the first place), but better than cheap earbuds. Ease of Use: 0/5 stars. The case can't charge the earbuds with the lid open. The lid cannot be shut with earhooks (necessary for keeping them in your ear) on, requiring they be installed and removed every time you take them on / off. Which will be fairly often with only 3-5 hours of battery life per charge. Speaking of charging, they didn't come with a cable I can actually use to charge the case, so they're having to share the cable for charging my phone. As a final note: I've had one instance of either the active noise cancelling, or the bluetooth connection glitching out and causing a high-pitched and max-volume shrieking sound. Thankfully it only lasted for a moment, but it *was* quite shocking and painful. If it turns out to be a recurring problem then these earbuds will be going straight into the bin where they belong. Overall, the fit for these earbuds is terrible. Apple is the only brand I've ever had this problem of earbuds refusing to stay in. The active noise cancelling is mediocre, and the sound quality is above average. Given how expensive they are, you're probably better off finding a pair of cheaper and better fitting wireless earbuds.\", 'If you have ever worn headphones or ear-pods to listen to music, talk on the phone, or your favorite podcast, nothing will compare to these AirPods. I was VERY skeptical purchasing these because of the price tag, however in just the first few minutes of wearing them and realizing the functions that these offer made it all worth it! From alternating noise cancelling options, to geographically locating each AirPod individually (just in case you drop one somewhere), the sound quality is absolutely mind-blowing! The customization of the sound modes gives you limitless options to enjoy your favorite music with perfect balance. My personal favorite option is the ability to turn on and off noise cancelling functionality so you can still listen to music and be able to have a conversation with someone, and not miss a single word! Keep in mind, there are thousands of options out there for headphones, ear-pods, both wired and wireless; but these have surpassed all of my expectations. I have tried a few dozen different kinds and have never spent more that $30 for them. So, being as frugal as I am, seeing a $200+ price tag for them when they were first released really made me scoff. I thought, \"I will NEVER spend that much on a pair of headphones! Especially ones that are wireless and I could easily lose...\" Therefore, I never saw myself owning a pair of AirPods, let alone the pro version. Now as I sit here and type a review of these, while wearing them listening to a random playlist, I can easily say these will be the last headphones/ear-pods/AirPods I will ever buy. They are very comfortable to wear as well and come with an array of earplugs that are designed to fit your ear canal snuggly and without any gaps, so the AirPods do their job and process the sound they\\'re projecting with the most efficiency as possible. The microphone does a great job picking up even the faintest of whispers, and filters ambient sounds out very well. They also do well in windy conditions and process out the noise even a strong wind produces. I really don\\'t have anything negative to say about them at this time. If I did have to be extremely picky, one negative is that I have a hard time removing them from their charging box because the magnet is SO STRONG I find that they are sucked back into the box if I don\\'t have a good grip on them. However, with that being said, the nitpicking seems almost laughable. All-in-all I would give these AirPods a 10/10. They are the complete sound immersion device and I would be hard-pressed to find an equal, let alone a superior device to use for communication, music listening, etc. Enjoy these AirPods and buy with confidence! They\\'re worth every penny you\\'re about to spend.', \"They sound great, and the noise cancellation/transparency modes are awesome.  However, the main purpose for mine are working out, and these things fall out like crazy.  Stair climber, sit ups, bench press....they just don't stay in.  I tried all 3 size tips, and none will keep the airpod pros in during exercise.  I'll stick to my standard airpods with the $10 silicone wings....those never fall out.  It's a real shame, because noise cancellation on a stair climber or treadmill works great to block out the machine noise....well, at least until they fall out.\", 'I\\'m about two weeks into my new Airpods Pro and it\\'s time to drop some comments.  For context I\\'m coming from a $30 pair of Anker (wired) Bluetooth headphones that have served me well for 5+ years (and still work by the way), and Bose QC35 II headphones.  I\\'ve also spent an interesting amount of time with Bose QC30 headphones which would be more physically on par with the Airpods Pro. == Noise Cancellation== Noise cancellation in true wireless format  are the only reasons I was willing to chunk down $250 (an outrageous price even by Bose standards) for a pair of headphones.  I wanted something I could wear at the gym or on travel.  Note for those of you who don\\'t get the \"true wireless\" marketing term (I didn\\'t and had to look it up), it simply means Bluetooth headphones that don\\'t  have a wire between the two ear buds. Unsurprisingly my QC 35 IIs still outperform Airpods Pro *but* my QC35s have huge physical ear pieces to block out more sound so this isn\\'t entirely fair.  The QC30s are more of an earbud style and compared to Airpods Pro I\\'d say the two are on par when it comes to noise cancellation.  Maybe a slight edge to the QC30s. Where my Bose headphones shine is they switch between noise cancelling and no noise cancelling flawlessly, over and over.  My Airpods behave erratically switching between modes even once.  When switching between noise cancellation and transparent modes I\\'ve had the Airpods become unresponsive to click commands, lose connection in one ear, had the ear buds get out of sync, had noise cancellation in one ear and not the other, and a host of other issues.  I usually have to put the buds back in the case and let them sit for a minute or two to reset them. == Sound Quality == We buy ear buds to listen to stuff.  I listen to audio books, and am a Spotify junkie!  Also serving the occasional phone call.  I like a wide spread of music but mainly hang in the trance, electronica, rock, and metal categories.  The sound stage (that is, separation of instruments - making it so each instrument has a distinct position in your perceived space) is excellent!  Again not quite as good as my QC35s but darn close.  My Anker headphones don\\'t even compete. I think most electronica and low end bass lovers will be disappointed with the Airpods.  Being physically small makes it hard to do huge bass as it is, and I feel the EQ (not adjustable outside of Spotify) is tuned to focus more on the mid and high range.  Regardless, I was pretty disappointed at first, but I\\'ve adjusted a bit and am happy enough with the bass end now.  Mid and high range are superb!  I generally used a Rock EQ profile in Spotify\\'s settings with my Anker buds and Bose headsets.  I decided the \"Flat\" setting is better with my Airpods.  I will say that the bass end is very distinct on Airpods (like you can actually pick out the bass guitar!) and that crisp stage separation may be what ruins the generally smeared bass end of a lot of electronica aside from less physical thump. Audio books are not a problem at all, and so far phone calls seems good too. == Form Factor == Excellent!  Very comfortable, fit snugly, and I have yet to even  have an ear bud budget while running, cycling, rowing, etc.  These buds are really light and it\\'s easy to forget they\\'re in you ears!  So tiny they\\'re a little hard to deal with getting them in and out of their case. Apple provides three sizes of earpiece.  They are made of soft comfortable material.  I found I needed the large size.  Getting the ear piece off can be a little tricky - they snap on like little Lego bricks, and you have to pull on them until they pop off.  I was afraid i was going to tear them trying to get them off, but they seem to be pretty durable.  Be advised that there is a \"check fit\" option on your iPhone to help you find the right size.  Got into Bluetooth settings, and click the info button next to your Airpods to get to the Airpod settings. == Battery Life == I don\\'t have these in all day but I\\'d say the specs Apple provides are pretty close.  Maybe a little low.  I\\'ve gone 3-4 hours at a time without running out of juice. I usually listen at mid level volumes so if you crank it you may have a different experience. == Connectivity == CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY amazing!  Being an Apple product these paired up with my iPhone just by opening the case and holding my phone near.  That\\'s not the amazing part.  The amazing part is the range!  My Anker buds dropped out a lot at the gym if I was doing an exercise where my body effectively wrapped my phone and blocked the signal.  I could get maybe 30-40 feet if I had a clear line of site.  I forgot my phone in a stretching area and started a walk around an indoor track.  I must\\'ve made it 100 feet through walls, people, and gym equipment before my Airpods dropped out even a little.  I know a lot of this is Bluetooth 5 and not entirely unique to Airpods but I have to say I\\'m impressed! == Surprise Feature == I wasn\\'t particularly interested in more than the noise cancellation and small form factor.  Sound quality is important to me but not the main driver here.  While the spec sheet calls it out (and it wasn\\'t really a surprise) I am extremely surprised by how much I like the in-ear detection feature.  It\\'s really nice to be able to pop out a bud, have your music pause and have a conversation then put the bud back in and pick up again.  Pretty slick!  Also imperative since turning noise cancellation on and off causes problems and you have to take a bud out to talk. == Other Buggy Stuff == Apart from the things I\\'ve listed in the Noise Cancellation section, I\\'ve had a lot of other weird behavior.  Once I pulled the buds right out of the case and put them in my ears and  had one bud fail to connect.  Sometimes if I  put the buds in the case with noise cancellation on and then put the buds back in later they will come on without noise cancellation and won\\'t let me switch noise cancellation back on (through any method including settings on my iPhone). This is incredibly disappointing at this price tag let alone for an Apple product.  Bose charges the same money but they are rock solid when it comes to the prime use cases.  In general I feel like Apple\\'s quality continues to degrade with every release.  I get bugs are part of software (it\\'s what I do for a living) but you don\\'t release a product with major and obvious bugs in the primary use case of the product.  Especially at this price point!  My Anker buds were $30, have lasted me years, and have worked flawlessly.  Yea they\\'re simpler functionality, but still. == Bottom Line == In the hopes of a software update to fix all the weird issues, I am overall a fan and very pleased!  The noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life are not state of the art, but come together in a perfect form factor and make it happen for me.  I dinged a star for sound quality (need a little more bass end), and the general buggy state of the product.  My only other wish is these were in the $150 range.  That $250 is really hard to swallow, especially when things don\\'t work flawlessly.  But I expect to be gouged by Apple so I go in knowing you\\'re going to over pay on the expectation you\\'re going to get a flawless top quality product.  Didn\\'t quite pan out this go.  Software updates may change that.', 'This review is especially for people who are deaf in one ear (SSD), Single-sided deafness After a hesitation for about a month, I decided to buy Apple AirPods Pro. I couldn’t find any information on whether it would help my SSD. But I decided to go ahead and buy a pair anyway. In addition to the full bodied fantastic sound, I’m extremely impressed by the Transparency and Noise Cancelation modes. You can actually use Noise Cancellation with no sound coming out from your device. Meaning, you can mute all surrounding noise just like an ear plug. I was surprised also that Noise Cancellation works for the other party if you’re making a phone call. For example, I was talking to my wife while standing next to my noisy AC compressor in my backyard, but after applying noise cancellation she only heard my voice; the noise that came from the compressor completely disappeared. Transparency mode saves us the embarrassment when someone talks to us while listening to music. Transparency mode enables the other microphone on the AirPod so that you can hear your surroundings at the same time you’re listening to your device. And by the way, you can use one airpod at a time with both features, noise cancellation and transparency. I am deaf in my right ear so I can take my AirPod  for the right ear place it in my left ear upside down and it works just fine. The AirPod is so  very light, and after a few minutes of wearing it you don’t even feel it’s there. You can wear it all day long. In addition, you can also use the Live Listen feature, where you can place your phone at the side of your deaf ear and listen to whatever happening there.', 'I\\'m a runner, and I bought these to replace the headphones I used exclusively for running since they were IPX5.  These also offer some IP rating that should ensure I won\\'t have issues running.  I transitioned to these from some Liberty bluetooth headphones I really liked.  These weigh less, and the sound quality is not really an improvement, but since they allow Siri hands-free, they get an overall bump in performance over the ones I\\'m coming from. Pros: 1) Fantastic noise isolation/cancellation.  My Liberties had this feature, but there is an improved isolation to these headphones that allows for a more natural sound profile than the last ones achieved.  There is less bass in these headphones, but they sound better because the music and voices (in podcasts) are reproduced more naturally. 2) They\\'re made by Apple for an Apple ecosystem, and since I drank all their Kool-Aid I own a bunch of Apple gear.  They work with all of it, and allow Siri hands-free, which really helps if my hands are full or if I\\'m running and want to turn down the volume without trying to mess around with my watch dial. 3) They\\'re pretty comfortable.  I had the regular Airpods, and these rubber tips make for a better seal and ever so slightly more comfortable fit while walking around.  While running, however, these are FAR AND AWAY much better than regular Airpods.  I do like the tap feature on Airpods better than the squeeze feature on these, however.  I wish these had the tap gestures instead. CONS: The reasons they don\\'t get 5 stars from me are: 1) The tips won\\'t fit my left ear properly.  The regular size fits my right perfectly.  The left one small, medium, and large will not get a proper seal.  I use them now with the regular one and deal with the fact my left ear isn\\'t a perfect \"size\" for these tips.  I did have the same issue with the Liberty ones, so it\\'s not isolated to Apple.  That\\'s not an issue in and of itself to drop a star.  But in addition: 2) There is some bad wind noise when I use these running.  I had no wind noise to speak of when using the Liberty bluetooth set.  It\\'s worse if I listen to podcasts than it is when I listen to music.  I console myself with the fact that on the second half of my runs, when the wind is at my back, it disappears.  But it\\'s a little disappointing to have the superb noise isolation/cancelling not be able to deal with the wind. 3) The battery life on the case is ok.  It\\'s not bad, but just ok.  And the first time I charged it, it only went up 10% in three hours (using the supplied USB C to Lightning, plugged into a $249 CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 docking station).  When I switched it to a wall outlet, the charging was normal, but I use that docking station to charge an iPad Pro 2018 with no issues.  Maybe it was an anomaly, it was the first charge, and I\\'ve had these only a couple weeks. Overall, I\\'d rate them 4 stars.  I almost went with 3 stars, but when I use them inside, they\\'re a 6 out of 5, and they work so well with my iPhone, and we SOOOOO much less than the liberties with almost the same sound quality, and they are pretty seamless moving from iPhone to Apple Watch when I go running and leave my phone at home.  So overall, they deserve more than a 3-star rating. I\\'m keeping them, but that is due in large part to the fact that I bought them on sale for $199, and when Apple headphones drop under $200, the AppleCare+ also drops from $29 to $19, so I got Airpods Pro with AC+ for 2 years for $218 and for that price, I can run to my heart\\'s content knowing if I have any issues between now and Sep 2022 I\\'ll get a replacement.  That also offsets some of the issues I have with them, so I feel like 4 stars is a fair rating for these.  If I had paid $249 plus $29 for AppleCare+ I would return them.  I would recommend them only if the price dips again below $200.', 'Usted quiere escuchar música mientras lava los trastes para que su señora descanse. Entiendo, entiendo.  Mira haces una buena inversión al comprarte de estos. Y aun si nomas quieres usarlos cuando hablas por teléfono te deja las manos libres para que puedas moverlas agusto. Vamos a decir tú señora tiene un par y quiere escuchar grupos de esos como BlackPink. Cosas así. Tu quedas bien parado. Ella puede escuchar eso y tú en los tuyos escuchas tus rancheras. No pierdes nada.  Hasta tiene cancelación para sonidos, cuando no quieres oír que se quejan que te compraste esa tele enorme en vez de la bolsa que ella quería.  Los AirPods Pro tienen muchas ventajas sobre los AirPods normales entre otras cosas……..cancelación de sonido, ventilación para regular presión dentro del oído para que puedes tenerlos puestos varias horas sin que te duelan los oídos, mejor calidad de sonido, bajos más resonantes, y conforman al oído mejor que los AirPods normales. Para todos estos beneficios mencionados compra los AirPods Pro. Cuestan un poco más que los regulares. Pero si vas a hacer algo hazlo en grande. ¿Verda pariente? Hechatelos. Los mereces.', \"I bought the pro version three months ago and accidentally tossed them into the trash (I was drying them with tissues) so I went for the cheapest replacement (Airpods 2). Here are my thoughts as to which one to choose. If this is the only listening device you have and you care about music quality, then buy Airpods Pro (noticeably superior music quality that falls far below earphones such as Sennheiser HD599; the quality is also below that of Boss QC35II). (If I were you, I would buy the cheaper airpods 2 AND an HD599.) If you use this to listen to audiobooks, or if you have better earphones for music at home, by all means go for the regular Airpods. Why? I personally find the regular airpods far more comfortable. The regular airpods are like the earbuds that come with Iphones -- while not the most comfortable, wearing them for two hours is not a big problem. I found the pro version extremely uncomfortable after wearing them for more than an hour. The noise cancellation is cool, very cool, but not essential for my usage. If you travel frequently on domestic/short flights, then airpods pro might be great for its noise cancellation feature. But bear in mind Pro airpods are not the most comfortable. Moreover, battery lasts about 3-4 hours so Airpods Pro won't be ideal for longhaul flights. The noise cancellation works very well -- even comparable to my Bose QC35II. (It won't shut out all noise, thought, but I did try Bose + Airpods Pro --> the result is excellent. But would I travel like that? Prob. Not.) What I like about both: if you have lots of Apple devices, switching across these devices is very easy (2-3 clicks/taps). So for this regular version, I rate: 5/5 for music quality (considering the size); 2/5 for comfort; 5/5 for noise cancellation (considering the size).\", \"I really wanted to love these. The sound quality is great. Battery life is good. I could even get used to the fact that there's only one color option. But they fall out too often. They would fall out mostly when I bent over to pick something up. Oftentimes, on concrete. It was a matter of time before they break from constantly falling out. I called the support line. They actually asked me if I had the right pods in the right ears. Yes, I tried all three tips. Yes, I see that there are aftermarket tips that I could buy. I don't like the fact that the case won't close with these 3rd party tips. Besides, at the price Apple is charging for these, they ought to fit. I even wanted to give these 2 stars since they worked well - when they stayed in. But since I had to return them after a few short weeks, it's a total fail.\", 'Coming from the Jabra 65t, I figured it would match up in terms of ease of use. Not so. - Transparency mode volume needed to be lowered to simulate what the outside will sound like without the airpods. Left on default ment I can hear the bus engine louder than necessary. - Only some control is in the pods themselves: play, pause, skip, siri, and switching through active noise canceling/transparency. No volume control. - Using between other Bluetooth connected devices actually worked flawlessly. (Granted it was between apple products.) If you’re not phone deep in the Apple ecosystem, you can pass on these and not feel like you’re missing out on anything. Go with some Jabras and you’ll have a better time. But if you got at least an iPhone or the iPod touch, it might be worth investing in these, just for the fact that it’ll work without any issues.', 'These air pods are amazing. They paired with my HP Laptop quickly without the expected hassles. They paired with my Note10 with no trouble and paired with my i pad by simply placing the air pods next to the tablet. The reason for the 3 star rating is because they do not tell you that if you do not have an Apple product such as an i phone or i pad you cannot charge them. I purchased the charging cube and the charging wire does not fit. I tried my i pod cord and it does not charge the air pods. You have to connect or wireless connect to an Apple product. Not happy about that. Good thing I just happen to have an apple I pad.', 'I was so excited to buy these Airpods Pro for my husband as an anniversary gift. He talked about them for the past month. He started pairing them with the iPhone and reading through the directions and then testing them out and LOVES them.  Then as we continued to read through the information about how to charge the \"WIRELESS\" case, it became evident that something was missing from the box.  There was a wire, with two different ends, that DO NOT FIT in the iPhone or the IPAD, for the purposes of charging.  NOR does this wire fit in any of the 10 APPLE adapters that we own for all of our other apple products.  So I got on a chat with Apple Support, since I purchased the extended Apple + Care, to find out if I was actually missing or received the wire item. I rechecked the Amazon listing and although it does not say not included, it does not say that it is included either. But as an Apple user, usually an adapter is included with their products. I found out from the Apple Support person that APPLE NO LONGER PROVIDES ADAPTERS TO ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS.  He sent me a link to purchase a $49.00 adapter to buy, in addition to what I had already spent on the AirPods Pro, the AppleCare, and now in order to use & charge them, I have to buy yet another adapter.  I explained to Apple Support my disappointment that I thought this was crazy that they were only out to now make more money. BEWARE, before you buy any more APPLE Products that they are now making you buy an adapter to charge their products.  Disappointed in Apple, the Airpods, my husband loves but I certainly put a damper on me giving him a gift that wasn\\'t fully complete.', \"I have small ears which has proved to be problematic in the past with ear buds. Then add into the mix 3 inner ear piercings (daith in each ear, and one tragus) which means there was potential that they buds wouldn't stay in my ears at all. But, I have been doing a lot more out door walking and wanted to try the air pods pro any way since they were different from the traditional air pods that mimicked their ear buds. Let me tell you, I was expecting to try them and then return them within a few days, but that was not the case at all. I ended up loving them. They have managed to stay in place despite the earrings and the size of my ear and the small ear tips were just what my ears required for such a device. It's amazing how having that smaller option aside from medium and large makes such a BIG difference. The only thing is, if I am not playing my music loud, I can hear the outside world with the noice cancelling option on, but in reality it's still better than I expected and it doesn't impact my ability to hear the music or phone call at all. The transparency mode is amazing, if you compare it between the noice cancellation and off options, you hear everything as you should without the pods in your ears at all. That being said, if you compare the noice cancellation to the transparency mode, you can hear the difference. If I could give a 4.5 star, I'd give it that because the difference is so noticeable. That being said I love this product and was happy I decided to jump in and give it a chance. In my opinion they are totally worth the money spent.\", 'Look, Apple AirPod Pros should be a great product, they are Apple, and my whole family loves Apple.These are from Amazon and the sound was terrible so I returned them.  Plus they would not fit into my ears correctly and kept falling out.  When I make.a return I usually get an instant email stating I have been credited.  This time nothing.  When I called, because they are a lot of money, they had no reason why just told me 7-14 days.  Whaaaat???  They couldn\\'t tell me why it was just a \"That\\'s how it is,\" type of voice on the other end.  I do 20-30 orders a month from Amazon.  If I ever return it has always been immediate, but not this time.  The whole point of this review, is not that Apple is junk, because they are not.  This was just faulty, no biggie.  But, I will not be buying these again from Amazon.  Be Leary.  I will go somewhere else because it does not take half a month to get a return when needed.  I\\'ve never had this happen with Amazon and I do not get it or like it.  Don\\'t buy Apple on this site, go to the company directly for the same price or buy on their website for the same price and if needed, get your refund sooner.  More than likely you\\'ll get a great product and will not need to return.  Weird.', 'I deliver food for work and bought these so I don’t need to free a hand to call someone. Here are my main commands: 1: “Hey Siri, navigate to (address).” I use Apple Maps and usually, navigation begins immediately. This has been saving me time since I can say it while I put the food in my car as opposed to waking my phone and typing the address. 2: “Hey Siri, call (phone number) using Voice.” I use Google Voice for work so customers don’t get my personal number. I realized today that volume is extremely low with just one Airpod in. I will be using both in Transparency Mode so I can hear navigation, texts, etc. more loudly. The silicone tips did not work well for me. I purchased some memory foam tips that work great. The size and weight of the Airpods is great. They’re nothing like the original Bluetooth earpieces from the early 2000s. The battery life is not so great but considering Transparency Mode is actually the outside speakers listening to sounds and playing them through the inner speakers, I can understand that the batteries are constantly being worked. Overall, I’m very satisfied with my purchase and happy I stuck with the option that is directly compatible with my iPhone.', \"Previously, I owned the first generation of the airpods and was very happy with them. I was forced to buy this pair because my dog chewed up the left earphone of my first pair. In the new pair, the battery life is excellent and the sound quality is as good as any in ear headphone I have tried. I also really like the method for playing and pausing audio which is just squeezing the bottom of the headphone. The new noise cancellation feature is my biggest grievance. After 3 months of use, the headphones now crackle when I'm using either transparency or noise cancellation mode. The crackling increases dramatically whenever I talk. If I turn off noise cancellation and transparency, then the headphones stop crackling. Pretty disappointing for such expensive headphones.\", 'First and foremost, these are authentic Apple AirPods Pro. Some reviews claim they are not...they are! From the packaging to the smooth operation. It’s all Apple. The Good Stuff:  The paring / connection process was seamless and intuitive....as only Apple can do. I like the fact I can flip open the charging case and get a quick view of charge status of AirPods & Charger. In my experience, a fully charged case will get you four (4)...maybe five (5) complete AirPod charges. That’s great when traveling or mobile/remote. In control center you can also configure the AirPods. A quick & easy step. The noise cancellation is about 90%....worked great while flying. The transparency mode is perfectly balanced too. Just enough outside noise to keep you aware. You’ll also like the Spatial Audio mode too. Very cool... The Bad Stuff: The silicone ear buds didn’t work for me at all. I bought memory foam style replacement buds. That solved that! All in all, I’m loving these AirPod Pro’s....I understand Apple will be releasing a newer Pro version that eliminate the short stems on each AirPod. That would make them perfect for inside the motorcycle helmet. I’ll see....for now, these are perfect!!!!', 'I was initially hesitate to purchase these because they are a bit more expensive than other similar earbuds.  And, because I intended to use these primarily during my workouts, I was concerned about them staying in my ears.  My workouts consistent mostly of weight training.  I am not a runner.  Nor,  do my workouts include lots of sudden or dramatic head movements.  However, I sweat--alot.  These earbuds stayed in place.  A few times, I did feel the sensation of my left earbud loosening a bit.  But, it never fell out and I just pushed it in for a firmer feeling fit.  Interestingly enough, the right earbud stayed in place--no problem.  Maybe I have a weird left ear canal, maybe I just needed to adjust the earbud into place in a better way or maybe it fits fine and I need to get used to the feeling.  Either way I will consider this a me issue and not due to the buds. The noise cancelling is outstanding.  Please note, sound beyond the earbuds is not eliminated.  However, it is greatly and I do mean greatly reduced.  Most noticeably, to my ears,  lower frequencies.  I had these on three feet from my white noise machine.  With only the noise cancellation function activated, the white noise was barely audible.  I could hear my television but only the faint sound of voices.  Certain frequents are definitely cancelled out and what remains is drastically reduced in volume.  When I play audio and activate noise cancellation, outside noise is almost totally eliminated. The spatial audio function is fantastic.  I really enjoyed the experience.  I could sense the atmosphere of whatever I was listening to.  The audio was full and dynamic.  The quality of the audio is outstanding. In summary, I highly recommend these earbuds.', 'Oh my goodness. These are incredible. 1) Background & Comparison: I have had the Bose QC35 headphones for a year, and just purchased the Bose SoundSport Free (after purchasing the AirPods Pro) and love them both, but these AirPods Pro buds are SO lightweight I actually forgot I had left one in my ear at work the other day (no music playing of course). I don’t see a need for wearing my QC35s anymore because they’re heavy and large. After I purchased the AirPods Pro, purchased a pair of Bluetooth Bose Soundsport Free to compare sound and bass. Sound quality is great on the SoundSport Free model but I have issues with the size (even smalls tips hurt my ears) and they are bulky. Sorry, Bose, I really wanted to love your product but the AirPods Pro win for me due to size, ease of use, and comfort. —— 2) Fit: My ears hurt with a lot of earbuds styles bc I have smaller ears, but the medium sized tips surprisingly fit great. There’s functionality to test the ear tip fit while you have them in your ear - I assume it tests pressure and seal that the tips make in your ear canal. They also don’t fall out and seem completely snug. I did work out in them, but haven’t run or done any kind of strenuous activity with them, but would be interested to see if they stay in while running. So far, I would assume they do based on the secure fit. —— 3) Noise cancellation & transparency mode: I work in an open office and was completely shocked by the noise cancellation mode. It is AWESOME and really muffled out most (95%?) of the noise. I might wear these at work without playing music just so it’s quiet and I can focus better. Transparency mode is excellent for doing things around the house or wearing on a trail where I need to be cognizant of surroundings, and still want to hear my music. —— 4) Audio quality: I feel like I don’t need to turn these up as loud as I have had to with other brands. Ear tip fit is great and sound is crystal clear. I wish they had more bass, but I do find the bass quite sufficient. I generally seek out bass in my headphones because of personal preference, and I’m happy with them. I do wish there was an equalizer to be able to adjust the settings for the use, but I’ll leave that to my music apps to do. Sound quality is great and I hope it will save my ears a little bit from not having to turn them up like I have had to with my other earbuds previously. —— 5) Conclusion: These are amazing. Form and function are great, and most of all, they are lightweight and ease of use is excellent. Highly recommended.', 'I\\'ve had normal AirPods basically since they came out. Always liked them. Then my son got some AirPods Pro\\'s and I tried them out. The bass alone was enough to get me to make the upgrade. But then I got them and realized there is so much more to them. With the noise cancelling feature, and the spatial audio, I am blown away with these. Spatial Audio, for those that don\\'t know, is a feature where if you\\'re using the AirPods Pro\\'s to watch a movie that supports it, if you turn your head, the audio stays in the direction of the screen. It makes it more like watching a movie in a room or theater. In some cases you can actually \"feel\" the audio coming from the screen. It\\'s hard to describe, but really incredible to experience. I\\'ve told a few people about getting the Pro\\'s and it\\'s the first thing I tell them about. Makes watching a movie with these very immersive. Noise cancelling is great as well. If you\\'ve never tried headphones with noise cancelling before, you\\'re missing out. I don\\'t think I could say these do it better than anyone else, but they certainly work well. I can barely hear my wife when she\\'s sitting right next to me and trying to ask a question. Luckily there\\'s a simple toggle where you can hold the AirPod on the stem to disable it to allow outside noise in. The most useful time for this feature is when mowing the lawn. I have to double check every now and then that the mower is running cause you really can\\'t tell. If you like AirPods, you\\'ll love the AirPods Pro!', 'I\\'ve only had the air pods pros for about a week now, so this will be a high level review that I will plan to update with more experience. My first reaction is that they are everything I had hoped in terms of Apple product integration.  The other ear buds I was using were very clunky when switching between devices.  I am a macbook/iPhone user and do zooms and calls all day long so that\\'s an important feature to me.  The air pods pro are very good in that regard. Fit and comfort has always been a complaint of mine when it comes to air pods.  The original air pods I thought represented the pinnacle of Apple\\'s arrogance:  one single hard plastic size will suffice for everyone.  The originals were terrible IMO and hurt my ears and didn\\'t stay.  The air pods pro feature a soft rubber tip (three sizes) which in my experience is just slightly better.  For me, I\\'ve yet to find the right fit that will stay in my ear -- and I\\'m not even talking while being active, I\\'m sitting at a desk working and talking and they fall out. The noise cancellation function is really very good with the different settings offered.  I am impressed by this as I have not had that feature in the past. Here\\'s my biggest gripe and I REALLY hope it\\'s solvable or these earbuds will be worthless.  For whatever reason, it seems like all ear bud makers place a VERY high value on having some touch features that control devices associated with each earbud -- volume, pause/play, switching between noise settings.  It\\'s overcooked in my opinion and is not a feature I\\'m looking for.  And here is why:  if you are constantly having to fiddle with the earbud to make sure it stays in your ear, you will unavoidably trigger these features inadvertently. And the biggest headscratcher of all:  DEAR APPLE - WHY IN GOD\\'S NAME WOULD YOU EVER HAVE A \"FEATURE\" WHERE ME TOUCHING MY EARBUD HANGS UP A CALL?!?!  WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!!!!!!  Gosh, I wonder if it was foreseeable that users would touch/adjust their earbuds from time to time and that hanging up calls as a result would be an undesirable outcome??  This doesn\\'t happen once in a blue moon, it happens ALL THE TIME.  I\\'m trying to figure out how to disable these \"features,\" but as seems common to Apple\\'s design hubris, they are certain they know better than I which features are useful and which should be cast into the abyss.  I\\'ve just ordered some aftermarket, third-party foam replacement tips in the hopes this will help with fit and maybe solve this problem.  But if that doesn\\'t solve the problem, I\\'ll probably return these because it turns out that regularly hanging up calls/zooms is not a useful feature for me. I hope to update this review with more experience and hopefully resolved issues.  For now, these ear buds are a big question mark to me and I would not recommend them as of now.', \"These AirPods are amazing.  The noise cancellation and its inverse ambient noise allowance are incredible.  I use them riding my bike to be able to still hear movement around me, and I use them in my shop to drown out loud noises.  Both functions work extremely well. But.. 2 weeks in and now my left AirPod no longer holds charge.  I can put it in the case and see it get up to about 35%, but as soon as it comes out it drops to 7% and then dies.  The AirPods haven't been dropped or put through the washer or anything: it just appears that one has gone defective.  That being said, it is also very hard to monitor battery life on them.  You have to have the case with you, and even then it doesn't always show you battery status.  You may have to enable it as an extra screen on your iPhone, and then sometimes it won't tell you the charge of each individual AirPod.  I found this frustrating for the few days I was trying to diagnose what was failing before retuning. them.  Hopefully I'll be sent me a new pair and they can hold charge.\", 'Apple has done it again. They continue to prove why they’re one of the best tech companies in the world. After doing some research on the AirPods Pro I decided to buy some. Everywhere else, Apple.com, Best Buy are selling them at the regular retail price of $250. When I found they were on sale on Amazon for $199 that is a deal I could not pass up. I couldn’t be more happier with these. These AirPods make the original AirPods look weak in comparison. Number one the design: The design of the AirPods Pro is phenomenal. The stems as the end do not look like q tips like the original AirPods. And the perfect oval shaped top. Number two the tips: The original AirPods didn’t come with tip. In fact, you have to buy some tips from other manufacturers; the AirPods Pro come with 3 size tips small, medium, and large. Number 3 the sound: The bass sound on the AirPods Pro is top notch. It reminds me of the bass sound on the Beats by Dre when they were a thing and so on. The original AirPods didn’t have any bass in them, and even when you buy some tips from a 3rd party company, the bass was still poor compared to the AirPods Pro. Number three noise cancellation: Noise cancelation is a plus from me. When I go exercising, I’m aware of my surroundings, but I don’t like hearing traffic or certain things when I’m listening to music. Another plus is, you can turn it off if you don’t want to use the noise cancellation feature. The original AirPods didn’t have any noise cancellation. Overall, the AirPods Pro is a great investment and yes you should upgrade to them. $199.99 is an excellent price given how much Sony is charging for their WF1000s.', 'AirPod Pro review Its an Apple product, so you expect a certain standard. Im sorry to conclude that the Apple AirPod Pros fell short of my expectations. But, if you have huge ears, like to overpay, purchase a product that requires you to buy something else, not be able to disinfect, and have a short battery life while thinking your call might have dropped, this is perfect for you. I have been using headphones for years and prefer the in ear style of headphones with the rubber tip. Unfortunately, for the AirPod Pro, while the rubber tip insert part was fine, the hard plastic that swells up past the rubber caused me discomfort and required me to take them out often. This bulbous part of the earpiece also prevented me from inserting the earphone deeper in my ear they way I am used to, which made the earpiece fall out whenever I bent over. It made working out with them a nuisance. I have never thought my ears were too small for in ear style headphones before I started using the AirPod Pros. While I loved the ability to choose between Active Noise Cancellation technology or I guess regular mode, there was some issues. I would hear static or clicksrandomly at times. Almost like they needed to find signal or lost it. It is disconcerting when talking to someone during a phone call and hearing that, making me feel like the call had disconnected. This would happen with the phone in my hand. The battery life is just too short. While I know you could put them back in the case for a quick charge, I still cannot use them if they are in the case. I felt like I was married to the case because of this. So now I am carrying a phone and case around which is just too much. Not to mention that since I sweat a lot when working out, I have had to wipe them down often. But the left earpiece stopped working which means they cannot handle that level of moisture. Not only that, in the age of COVID, and the need to disinfect everything, you are risking damaging your earpieces when disinfecting. Even more so since they keep falling out of my ear and hitting the floor. There also seemed to be an issue with the charging case sending information to the iPhone about the charge levels. The window that is supposed to pop up on my phone screen when I opened the case to indicate charge levels would work randomly. I love the freedom wireless headphones offer. This was my first attempt at trying them. Unfortunately, The AirPod Pro have made me feel that using my ten dollar wired In ear headphones with the adapter for the iPhone seem like the way to stay until they resolve these issues. I would also like to add....If you still intend on buying the AirPod Pros, get ready to purchase the USB-C charging adapter, or use your old USB-A lightening cord and adapter. Apple is making it a habit of not providing you with the equipment necessary to use your purchase without having to buy more items or already own them. I recently acquired an iPhone 12', \"I am not an Apple Hater as I own and have been in their ecosystem for over 15 yrs, but I am honest and refuse to be a fanboy or sheeple for them. The original Airpods were a very good product and I still use them sometimes on my commute. First of all, these are very uncomfortable to wear, I have many sets of earbuds and by far these just do not sit well in the ear and need to come out after about 30-45 minutes of use. I can't point to a single reason as to why this is, I've tried all the tips and all of them are the same, just a dull ache that slowly gets worse as time goes by. Also very loose fit in the ear even with the large tips. Secondly the ANC is just not good. I get much better sound isolation from everyday non ANC buds with proper fit in my ears. There is little difference between ANC on or off. Really try out the Jabra 85T's or Sony's WF-1000XM4's if you really want to know what ANC is in ear buds. Thirdly, features. I've already mentioned the subpar ANC but the touch controls are terrible. Most of the time they don't register anything no matter how I squeeze/touch them. Or if they do I get the wrong thing to happen because the first squeeze is delayed so I try again and now get a double or triple squeeze instead of one. No idea why this is either, fingers are not dry, tried a more forceful squeeze and no difference. Battery life? Real world use 4 hrs if your lucky with ANC, while same type of use the Jabra 85T's are usually 5.25 hrs and the Sony's WF-1000XM4's are around 8 hrs with ANC on. So as far as the price they charge for these I would rather purchase another brand for what you get. Or just stick with the non Pro versions.\", 'Welp. That was a waste of $250. These are great for listening to music and ONLY listening to music . But if you thinking spending this kind of money is going to get you some superior engineering, you will be sadly, and angrily, mistaken. The background noise on phone calls is absolutely insane. $250 and the other caller will not only be able to hear every little thing happening in the background, but it will be amplified. Last week I was making bacon while on the phone with a customer service agent and she said it was so noisy it sounded like a science experiment gone awry. I tried using them while taking a walk, I called a friend and he asked if I was literally standing in the middle of a speedway because he couldn’t hear me at all and it sounded like a race car was about to come through his ear. I have reset these AirPods repeatedly repeatedly, resetting barely works and when it does work it never lasts, they’ll have to be “reset” again with in days, sometime they have to be rest multiple time in one day. I have had them replaced and guess what, within weeks the exact same issue. BUYER BEWARE!!!  They’re terrible! Terrible!!  TERRIBLE!!!!! Apple should be ashamed to have the unmitigated gall to charge $250 for this product. They should be ashamed to put their name on this product. They should be ashamed of taking advantage of loyal customers after years of supposedly building a brand that people can trust, this is such a dismal failure that it calls in to question all of their products. I’m ashamed of myself for allowing brand recognition to replace good old fashioned research. If I had done more homework I would have discovered that this is a known issue that has gone on for YEARS AND YEARS that Apple clearly could care less about fixing now that we’ve all been dumb enough to just hand over our hard earned money for a terrible product.  They have destroyed their brand for me, I’ll never trust an Apple product again without doing some very deep vetting. Now I’m on the hunt for something that actually works and get to shell out even more money.', \"I really want to love these, but I always go back to using my regular Airpods or Bose QuietComfort.  The primary issue for me is that they do not stay in my ears and I am constantly having to push them back in, which is extremely annoying.  I have tried all the different bud versions, but none of them work for me. I hate having to carry two different differents, but I found the following combination to work the best for me. Normal Use - Airpods Exercise - Airpods w/ Silicone covers Airplane / Noise Cancelling - Bose QuietComfort For sound quality, Bose continues to lead the pack in my opinion.  Apple should acquire Bose by combining their Bose's silicone ear piece / sound quality with Apple's ease of use.  The combination would be unbeatable in my opinion in the current competitor landscape.\", 'I was caught by the presence of AirPods everywhere, thus splurged on these AirPod Pros during Amazon prime. Packaging is the usual Apple excellence but the AirPods are cheap plastic with even cheaper rubber ear cushions. Even though the Pro version comes with three sizes none of them fit my ear with a seal tight enough to keep them in my ear even walking a few feet. Not sure why they were designed the way they are. Why the spike which is very short? Sound is like ever other Bluetooth wireless headphones. Quality is on poor side compared to other Apple products (iPhones being their very best). The over the ear Apple headphones are definitely great sounding but dislike the “bra” holder versus a nice case (that was cutting costs for profit certainly not for design - embarrassing). Thus have returned these but fir the very first time Amazon still has not refunded my money when they were send by their UPS mailing back on June 25th. Thus this shopping experience has been one of my worst. The product itself not worth the hype nor Amazon living up to the previously quick refund process. I purchase more than $25,000 of various products on Amazon each year. Less than 1% return. I avoid secondary sellers since these products are frequently not what was listed. I hope to be eventually refunded but until I am all my current purchases are being done on other sites ($6000 past week). So save your money or buy directly from Apple who I gave never had a problem with returns or typically quality of their products. Who knows whether the Airpods I received were actual brand name. They sure were poor quality and did not fit either ear. Would recommend trying them at a local store before buying here, if at all. Update: July 13th and stilll no refund despite receiving the item by tracking number. Amazon return service is not like it use to be. Update: July 17th. Item was received by Amazon over two weeks ago. Still no refund. This is quickly turning into a $200 scam by a company whose reputation is quickly eroding.', \"I'm still in disbelief that these things just would not stay in my ears no matter what I did. I wanted to upgrade my regular Airpods and decided to splurge on the pros. The sound quality was fantastic and I really loved the noise cancellation. I thought I hit the jackpot but these things will not stay in my ear. I think I have average to small ear holes and it literally did not matter what method I used or third-party accessories, these things do not stay put. I tried foam buds, I tried inserting the airpods using different techniques to create a suction or putting them in upside down. I had the most success using alcohol wipes to clean my ear holes and the buds before insertion. But, after about 15 or 20 minutes, they would slowly start slipping out. The less I talked, smiled or used my jaw the better they would stay in. But I'd rarely get past 30 minutes of use without having to catch them from falling or pushing them back into place. Regardless of the method or trick, doing anything beyond purchasing the damn things is not realistic or unreasonable for such an expensive Apple product. It should just work. The bare minimum is that they sit in your ear and stay there. I use Apple products for a lot of my electronics but this experience has honestly made me second-guess why I stay in the Apple ecosystem. It's just so wild to me that I couldn't get these to work.\", \"This is my first ever review of any product. I purchased these with the highest expectation of quality and performance from an apple product. Unfortunately, less than 6 months after purchase, these airpods began disconnecting almost daily and had to be repaired with my iphone before I could use them again. When I am able to reconnect them, one airpod doesn't always work and I'm left running with only one of the airpods producing music. It's been disappointing and frustrating to say the least and I wouldn't recommend this product at all. There are more reliable products on the market, which also do not carry the unwarranted high cost for such unreliability.\", 'These headphones are literally everything I could ask for. I was one of those who was anti AirPod because they were bougie and I didn’t need to put more money in apples pocket. I broke down and bought these on Amazon prime day because my beats headphones still had a wire, never stayed in during my runs and frankly, they hurt my ears. Enter the AirPod pro. I have run close to ten mile runs with these and they have great sound quality as well as stay in without any pain. I have used them to row on an indoor rower with no issue. They stay connected as I walk away from my phone or do an at home workout. I never thought I’d be one of those people you see on TikTok using AirPods for everything....but here I am.', '', \"When they worked they were great. The issue is the warranty. I returned them because the right speaker sound was distorted. The product was under warranty but they refused to fix the broken speaker because they found a small crack on the left pod. The left pod works fine. They told me they would only fix the right pod if I paid them $95 to repair the left pod. I refused to pay the $95 so I'm stuck with a faulty pod they refuse to fix even though it's under warranty. I have since purchased Bose noise canceling buds. I'm done with Apple.\", 'I have the AirPods Gen 2 and I have loved them. I decided to try the Pro and had such high hopes for them. The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is fantastic, but for some reason the design of the new AirPods hurt my ears within 15-20 minutes of using them. I tried various tips but it did not seem to matter as the actual size of the plastic is larger I think at least. Whatever it is, I was sad I had to return them.', 'When I first tried these out I was a little underwhelmed, and after a few hours I continue to be. The clarity is great, the soundstage is pretty wide. The sound is just a little dry and the bass is really lacking. The noise cancelling feature is very cool but I can easily do the same with some earbuds that have rubber tips. If I need to hear someone I can just take the earbuds out. Switching back and forth between my other headphones and earbuds these definitely have the most clarity out of the bunch but the sound is just so flat. For $200 I feel that I’m paying more for the fact it’s native Apple support. I’ve previously been using some Sony over-ear Bluetooth headphones at home and then the Taotronics Sound Liberty 97 while I’m out at the gym. I thought I’d get these so I can just have one pair for everything, though I don’t feel it completely replaces either. There’s just something missing in the sound. Concerning the fit, I feel like these are constantly on the verge of falling out but they continue to stay in my ear. It’s a strange experience I had to get used to when I owned the original AirPods some years ago. I find myself constantly moving them (even though I don’t need to) which causes me to either pause the music or turn off/on transparency mode. I’ll give these a few more days to grow on me, but I most likely will be returning these. $200 can get me a lot of other things besides earbuds I’m not completely sold on.', 'Seamless integration, surprisingly decent battery life. Decent noise canceling.  Convenient case has battery in it, charges them without needed to be connected to power. Only minor gripe really is specific to my ear canal size…. using the smallest included tips, while good for long sessions, they do start to hurt my ears just a little bit. I’ll look into the possibility of 3rd-part earbud tips to see if there’s a set out there that might be less fatiguing for me during log listening sessions. Like wearing them every day, I can’t really do, it’s just not pleasant, really-inserting them into ear canals that already have some minorly sore soft-tissue.  Or maybe I’m just a weak baby. Can’t wear them laying down with head to the side on a pillow, it’s just not reasonably comfortable.  Some earbuds you can..  I’ve worn other ear buds from Bose and Ultimate Ears that didn’t cause minor pain in my ear, but those were not Bluetooth (wired), and were lighter.  It’s nice not having that wire to deal with for day-to-day use (wears down the wires/connections, especially the Bose QC model, but the design was horribly thought through in terms of creating obvious failure points where the wire meets the in-line battery/noise canceling hardware.  And of course the sound quality of the Bose and especially the Ultimate Ears units is significantly better (bass response, accuracy, frequency range, accurate reproduction etc.).  Hope this helps somebody.', \"Apparently, I am in a (very) small population of people that these will literally fall out of my ears if I am talking to someone. Problem was fixed by buying a set of stand alone foam tips that (click) in like original but have memory foam that when squeezed and pushed into your ears will help them stay put! First up is the noise cancellation, which is totally amazing! When you put these in you will think that you are in a totally different environment. Insert into your ear and they turn on automatically.  If you have had Noise Cancellation on from the past, it will automatically be on and cancel out every thing around you. Next Up: Transparency These really rock, if you feel like having a normal conservation turn off noise cancellation and start having a Normal Conversation. Comfort and Fit: After purchasing, I have no regrets. I can keep them in for hours and my ears do not feel stressed or hurt in any way. Sound: Let's face it, they sound great. Very well balanced with no pushy bass or overthumps. I would definitely purchase again.\", 'I own the second generation Airpods and comparatively, these were a lower overall quality product at a higher cost. The noise cancellation was a neat feature for this size headphone but compared to Bose or even off-brand headphones here on Amazon it was not earth-shattering. I found the fit to be iffy, as a runner that is very important to me and these did not do a great job. After a few months of use one Airpod Pro suddenly plopped out of my ear while I was sitting and fell into a sewer drain... This was a fitting end to an expensive mediocre product. I attempted to get help from Apple support hoping that they would consider a poorly fitting earbud to be a product issue but they said no... I could replace the one earbud for $94. No thanks, Apple. If considering Airpods I would point someone toward the regular Airpods and avoid the pro. The Pros have some cool features but they are not worth $249 price tage and none of the features are best in class. Go with another brand or the basic model.', \"Pros-  Sound quality is just INCREDIBLE!!!  I have had bose earbuds, these blow bose away, not even close.   -  comfortable earbuds   - Noise cancellation is awesome, can't hear her nagging....HA   - transparency is good to have, when you HAVE to listen to her nag!!!!!   -  charges back up fast, the power case to charge up is handy, easy to carry with me to charge!   - can charge on a platform cordless charger   -  mic is great   -  callers say they can hear me very clear, almost to clear, they hear everything........ Cons-  Battery life isn't what they say, it's the MOST disappointing aspect.   - Cord is confusing??? One end is the lightening plug, other end is android plug?????? luckily I had past cords   - NO POWER ADAPTER,  I spent over $230, Apple-- you cheap-asses, you guys can't include a square power   adapter?  DAMN.........   - When doing task, they fall out easier, and when I bend over to pick up something they fall out   - NO in ear hooks to keep them from falling out, had to buy them on the side..... AGAIN,  DAMN APPLE, YOU   CHEAP-ASSES!!!! ******* APPLE, THESE ARE VERY HIGH DOLLAR, WHY CAN'T YOU INCLUDE THOSE ITEMS I STATED?  I GET I AM JUST ONE PERSON GRIPPING, WORK ON THE BATTERY ISSUE.......\", \"I boughy these cuz i heard it was good for exercising. This is false. In short, they fall out a LOT, but everything else is nice. (Unfortunately since they dont stay in, u cant really appreciate the other features) AIRPODS 2.0 EXPERIENCE I used to use the airpods 2.0 and they never fell out even when running as hard as i can on the treadmill or any other exercise even abs. The airpods 2.0 never fell out, but they also didnt have noise cancellation. AIRPODS PRO EXPERIENCE Falls out at least every 0.05 miles on the treadmill. Honestly wanted to rip them out of my ears, hurl them across the room, beat them with a hammer, and burn them in a garbage can!!! I would give zero stars if i could!!! I adjust them at least 20 times a mile. Half the time Im running, im adjusting my airpods pro. Its so ANNOYING. Ive been using them for nearly a month and I hate it. They fall out just sitting down driving in my car. They fall out doing situps. They fall out just way too easily!!! I tried it without the rubber eartips once and they actually stayed in slightly longer. I used the smallest size because the other ones dont even fit in my ear without falling out 5 seconds of doing nothing. My ears arent even overly small. I use the small tips for other types of earbud tips all the time, but Ive never had this horrible of an experience with the earbuds falling out THIS often. Also my ears dont sweat. When they fall out it isnt because theyre wet or im sweating. They just suck at staying in. THE PROS of the airpods pro (dont make up for them falling out so often): - noise cancellation is amazing. Cant hear the treadmill much at all (for the 8 seconds the seal stays intact) - works with android for the most part. U cant customize the buttons or use sound pass thru mode or use siri, but u can pause, unpause, skip, and turn noise camcellation on/off with the buttons - case is still smaller than competition even though its slightly bigger and wider than the airpods 2.0. - case is high quality and long lasting even after dropping. Magnets keep airpods in tightly without being too hard to take out Overall would love these of they only stayed in!!! Instead it hate them!!! They're short of ruining my time at the gym\", \"Sounds quality is maybe on par with the regular AirPods. The sub-bass is non-existent and the low-end in general is absolutely anemic.  The Noise Cancellation was pretty good until they updated it and made it almost useless. You can still hear almost everything when ANC is activated now, it had no problem drowning out car noises on the first firmware. Why Apple would willingly choose to nerf their product and not release an update to fix it almost a month later shows that these are absolutely not ready for market. If you want to waste $250 to be a market tester for some not-so-great sounding headphones, this is for you. Everyone else just avoid them and stick to the standards or another brand altogether like the Sony WF-1000XM3's for better sound and Noise Cancellation\", 'Though the cancellation is the first I\\'ve ever had that didn\\'t make me feel like I had water in my ears, this doesn\\'t mitigate the fact that I cannot get these to stay in my ear comfortably and securely. Apple apparently things that there are only 3 types of ears in the world and screw it if you don\\'t fall under those three types. My echo buds fit great but they\\'ve got connection and battery issues to deal with which I purchased these. Sound quality isn\\'t amazing or anything, if you\\'ve used the head phones that come with the phone, these aren\\'t much better. Talking on the phone seems to be ok, I haven\\'t heard any complaints from people on the other end. With the echo buds, people said I sounded muffled. Really my only complaint is the shape of these are awful, like really awful. I just can\\'t seem to get them to sit in my ear right. It\\'s so bad that I\\'m considering returning them even though that\\'s going to be a huge pain to do. I tried texting Apple and they weren\\'t much help beyond, \"have you tried to fiddle with them?\"...yes... yes I did... Ugh... Anyways. I\\'d buy with caution. They\\'re pricey and this fitment issue would wave me off if I knew that it was going to happen.', 'After starting to work from home and having many conference calls, I decided to purchase the Pro version of the Airpods and they are great.  The stay in my ear much better than the cheaper ones and the noise cancellation helps with the other noises in the house. I will say that the noise cancellation is almost too much for phone conversations since you can\\'t hear yourself talk much either.  The noise cancellation is best for music.  The transparency mode is good for just leaving them in your ears to hear other surrounding noises.  They have transparency mode, noise cancellation mode, and NC Off mode that is somewhere in between the other two modes.  I use NC off for telecons, transparency mode between calls, and NC for music. These are especially good for me since I can only hear out of one ear so I no longer have to rotate which arm is holding the phone to my one good ear or use speaker phone.  I can actually rotate the two Airpods in my one ear as the batteries die (about every 3 hours with calls on and off). Using the right one in my left ear takes a little extra care when inserting it to \"trick\" the sensors but you can put it in your ear pointing up, allow it to initialize, and then rotate it down and it works fine. LOVE \\'EM.', 'These have give me nothing but trouble since I got them. They pop right out of the ear if I so much a look down or raise my eyebrows. I’m incredibly noise sensitive and have a lot of noise cancellation devices. These are definitely the worst I own. Most recently, I meticulously set up an entire professional scene for a zoom interview. The backdrop was beautiful. I was well rehearsed. I tested all the audio in advance. Everything was set up perfectly, and these pieces of crap just totally failed to play the audio. I got to spend the first 8 minutes of my interview disconnection and reconnecting and unpairing and repairing. I have a band new MacBook Air too. There shouldn’t be any connectivity issues. It’s unacceptable. Needless to say, I didn’t get the job. Today, they keep failing. It’s not even that they are disconnecting. They are still connected, just not playing any sound. Been just past the warranty, so I guess these are good for about a year. I’ll reach out to apple and tell you everything they say. Stay tuned.', 'Only had them a month and I really liked them.  The sound quality was great and the noise cancellation was amazing.  Worked great on phone calls too.  I was very careful because I always worry about them falling out.  I followed the instructions and did the test for fit.  According to Apple, I was golden.  And I was just starting to trust them.  They would stay in my ear.  I was wrong. First couple weeks I only used them in the house.  Then I got braver and took them in the car and the yard.  No problems.  They never fell out of my ears. I was binging out on a great Matisyahu playlist I found on Spotify.  I had to use the restroom.  I bent over just enough to hit the flush lever at the same exact moment in time my left airpod fell out of my ear and into the toilet.  I watched it go down the drain.  There was nothing I could do but yell expletives at the toilet.  FML. The bottom line, pun intended, is that Airpods are an amazing product but they are too easy to lose to be able to justify the cost.', \"Maybe these things work better within the Apple ecosystem, but I had a bear of a time getting these to work with anything non-Apple. Via a Bluetooth adapter, I used the air pods mainly on a Windows PC so I can listen to music without big cans on my head.  The medium ear canal pieces kept falling out of my ears so I tried the small and still couldn't keep them from falling out.  I felt like I had to jam them deep inside my ears just to get a decent fit. The sound was terrible as it sounded like I was listening with 2 cans and a string.  I was constantly fiddling with the equalizer to get more bass out of the air pods, but everything sounds super tinny no matter what kind of music I put on. I expected so much more from these as they are Apple's premium offering, but wow they are absolutely terrible and will be going back for a refund.\", 'Updated Review (original below) I’ve got to say, I really love my AirPod Pros. I use them daily. They’re a great pair of earbuds for Apple users. However, I noticed a problem after prolonged use. They cause my ears to dry out. I started noticing flaky, dry skin occurring. After a bit of research, I found many people have the same issues. Some people got ear infections from using the Pros. Turns out it’s because of the silicone tips they use for noise cancellation. The seal the tips create isn’t good for your ears. So if you’re prone to ear infections or other ear related issues, take this into account. Especially if you plan on using them a lot like I do. I’ve been wanting AirPods for a while but the price always held me back. Black Friday deals rolled around and I finally caved. I’ve been using them for about two months now and here’s my opinion and on them. 1. Sound quality is excellent. I’ve noticed more song elements than I did before with my JLab wireless earbuds. Songs are clear and crisp. There is a bit left to be desired when it comes to bass though. 2. Noise cancellation is pretty good. Although Bose still has Apple beat on this front. It’s quite impressive for earbuds honestly. I like that it has transparency mode as well. It lowers the volume so you’re able to better hear what’s going on around you. 3. Battery life is on par with most other wireless earbuds I’ve tried. I like that I can wirelessly charge the case since it doesn’t come with the required usb-c cable. (Apple is going to nickel and dime us to death.) 4. Other features I liked are the touch controls, Siri, and sense features. Siri works much better when I’m using my AirPods. I set Siri to work with my left AirPod so all I have to do is click once to activate her. But I mainly use voice to activate her which works just as well. Touch controls are easy and provide haptic feedback as well, another feature I appreciate. AirPods sense when you place them in your ear. So if you need to pop them out for a quick second to talk, your music/video/podcast is paused. It resumes on its own once you place your AirPod back in your ear. 5. My main complaint with my AirPods is the fit. They come with three different earbud tips. I started with medium but found them to be too big. My AirPods kept falling out after a few minutes of use. So I dropped down to the smallest size. These worked well for the first few weeks of use. But now I’m noticing my AirPods shift more and I keep having to reorient them every few minutes. Perhaps it’s due to the material the tips are made from? Maybe implementing a slight texture would help. Final impression - Solid earbuds with excellent sound. Siri seems to be at its best when paired with AirPods. But the price tag is still a turnoff. If you’ve got the spare cash, go for it. Otherwise there are a lot of great alternatives out there for much less.', 'I waited a long time to get a good price on these, and now that I finally have them, they are somewhat disappointing.  The \"spacial\" sound setting (which is accessed through you iPhone Bluetooth settings) didn\\'t seem to do anything.  Then one day it kicked in for a few minutes, and the sound was fantastic!  But then it quit.  I called Apple support, and they had me completely reset my iPhone.  That didn\\'t solve it.  But the support person talked to someone else who said to turn off the \"mono\" setting located in my phones \"Accessibility\" settings.  That solved it (Did I have to do a complete phone reset??). However, I have an ongoing issue.  If I set a timer on my Apple Watch, when it ends, it causes the music I\\'m listening to, to stop and the only way I can get it to go through the Airpods again is to disconnect the Bluetooth and reconnect it because the Bluetooth connection crashes.  I frequently will be listening to music at the gym and set a timer to monitor time between sets, but I have to \"watch\" the timer, because if it gets down to zero and goes off it will cause the bluetooth connection to crash.  The same thing happens if I get an incoming phone call while listening to music.  Additionally, the Bluetooth connection drops often, and for no reason.  Also, sometimes the touch pads don’t work right. Also, they do occasionally fall out of my ears, despite having the best size earplug on them (they come with 3 sizes of silicon ear plugs). Noise cancellation isn\\'t great. that is, I can still hear things around me between songs with transparency turned off. ALSO, only when I have these in, it will turn the volume down automatically, and a warning will come up that says \\'You have exceeded the weekly volume allowance and the volume has been turned down\\'.  WHAT?!  I don\\'t need \"big brother Tim Cook/Apple\" telling me how to listen to these!  Give me a break. Overall, the sound with these is great, and the touch pad control is nice (I wish volume could be controlled), but my old wired earphones were better in many respects. UPDATE:  The issues with these continued to get worse, so I have returned them.  I will be looking for a good price on another brand.', \"I'll start with my only complaint:  The right ear pod has had a couple of times it hasn't charged inside the case.  Not sure why because the left ear pod has always charged completely.  The right one was just dead.  I'm trying to make sure both pods are being put securely inside the case when charging and so far this has only been a problem twice. Now for the good stuff.  MAN OH MAN do these sound great!  I've never had noise-cancelling headphones that TRULY cancelled all noise around me.  Even people talking around me!  5 Stars for sure for noise cancellation! I was so afraid I'd lose them and that's been the main factor that has kept me from buying them, but the PRO versions come with small silicone tips (3 different sizes so you can find a size that fits you the best) and they feel 100% secure.  The sound quality is clear and perfect with a nice bass response.  The ease of just squeezing one of the stems on one of the pods to turn cancellation on or off, or squeeze it twice to skip to the next song on my playlist or answer the phone is just awesome and so easy!  I HIGHLY recommend these!!!\", \"I've been searching for the right earbuds/headphones for the last 5 months, running the gamut from cheap to expensive.  Some of the cheaper buds sounded good, but in order to get good sound, you had to have the perfect seal.  In my case, the seal would be fine until I moved around, then the buds would work their way out of my ears just enough to render the bass response useless. One the ear headphones like the Bose and Sonys sound terrific with good NC, but my ears would get warm.  Cheaper headphones didn't have solid NC and most times felt like my head was in a vice after 30 minutes. Apple has created the perfect listening device.  NC is phenomenal and the sound, while not comparable to big cans is remarkable with solid bass.  The ear fit test is brilliant and works perfectly.  It determined I needed a different tip for my right ear.  And to top it off, these buds are so comfortable (like the regular AirPods), you don't even notice they're in your ears. Yes, they're expensive.  Yes, they'll probably lose their charging ability in 2 years.  But are they worth it?  Absolutely.\", 'Wow. Apple has gone down the drain. The 1st gen were amazing. Only needed better isolation. These are a big downgrade sound quality wise. Also they do not fit properly or symmetrically. Also they are hard to pull out of the case. Also they do not come with a power brick. Also they are too expensive. And they sound bad!  Also battery life is a joke for 2019.  Also they are ugly!  Gen 1 and 2 were elegant and easy to handle - these are terrible to look at and to handle including the ridiculous click pads - good luck with those! Also cheaper headphones blow them out of the water in all categories - see Creative Outlier air and Gold! Only plus is decent noise cancellation IF they fit at all AND noise isolating ones do just as good a job.', \"Apple did a pretty good job with these. I particularly enjoy them for iphone and ipad. First thing I will say is right out of the box the case looks great but it is a bit annoying to grasp. It slipped out of my hand a few times so first thing I would suggest is to get a case. I also noticed that the case still is prone to scratches light or deep which I hate. The white makes it a little less noticeable unless you look in the lights. The closing and opening of the lid is nice. Compared to the older airpods, the case is larger which does not bother me. The airpods themselves fit snug inside the case. It did not fall out or anything. There is also no microphone opening at the bottom any more so I do not get that lint,dust build up under there. I am very happy with the overall fit. I love having the rubber ear piece back. It really helps with keeping them in my ear and also with sound. That being said, I did notice that there is actually a fit test for these airpods to ensure the ear piece you pick is the best for you. It actually does test to see if there is any sound that leaks out. If any sound does leak out then it will suggest you remove them. The next thing that the air pods fits great in my ear. There is a transparency mode and noise cancelling. I actually like having these two options. The transparency allows me to hear my surrounding area so I use that if I am walking in the park or outside. If I am studying, the noise cancelling is pretty nice. I do not hear very much outside. You can turn these modes by pinching the bottom part of the headphone. The only issue is that there is no distinguishing noise so you do not really know which mode you are on. These headphones still the same issues as the first generation in that you can't tap to change music. You can pause and play but no volume control or changing music. I am not entirely sure why these are not included in the headphones yet. I would love to be able to control the sound with my airpods rather than taking out my phone especially during work out. The battery life is okay. In about 1 hour the airpods dropped about 22%. The airpods last only about 4 hours which is okay for what I need it to do. It about the same average as most bluetooth headphones. I did connect it to an android and it still can play music but the voice does not seem to work so that is a bummer. I had the same issue with my first gen airpods too. Pairing this to your iphone is fairly simple and the connection is pretty strong. I left my phone in my garage and I still was able to stay connected four rooms away. My voice was pretty clear through these airpods on calls. I love using these for my work calls especially with the noise cancelling on. I do not hear loud office noise. Overall I think these are good airpods with good sound and clear microphone. The only downside is that it is not that much different from the first gen airpods. You can stop and play but no volume control or track change. Those should have been included at least especially with the introduction of tap for transparency and noise cancelling. That being said, if you want to upgrade from your first gen to this, I would not. It is not really worth the cost to upgrade as the extra features most people can live without.\", 'As I sat on my computer today, perusing options to buy another set of Apple’s AirPods Pro, it dawned on me: it’s about time I write a review for these bad boys, because I’ve used mine almost daily for the past year-and-a-half.   If you’re new to the world of Apple’s headphones and earbuds, you may not realize that Apple offers three options that will suit your needs much better than the standard, wired ear buds that come with some Apple products, like iPhones and iPods: 1: Airpods, which are the wireless companion to the standard earbuds the you’ll find accompanying some Apple devices. These Airpods are the size of the standard earbuds, if you were to cut the cords off at the very base of the earbud stems. They come in a small, square-shaped charging case with round corners, which serves as a convenient storage location for your AirPods, and accepts the standard Lightning USB cable to charge. 2: AirPods Pro, which have all of the features at the standard AirPods, plus a more comfortable fit, better sound quality, and two modes of sound augmentation, being a noise-canceling mode and a “Transparency mode”, which allows you to listen to your surroundings while you listen to your music, podcasts, or other media. 3: Lastly, Apple added the Airpods Max to their fleet this year. These are over-the-ear headphones that offer similar features to the AirPods Pro, minus the charging case. You’ll find that these headphones have better noise-cancelation and sound quality than the AirPods at the cost of a larger profile and price tag. Please note: While the cases for the AirPods and AirPods Pro accept the lightning cable to charge, they can also be placed on a mag-safe charging pad to charge. With that said, I’ve only btested the AirPods Pro with the lightning cable, as I do not own a wireless charging pad. So, Let’s Focus on the AirPods Pro  Keeping in mind that this post has no ties to any outside entity, so my opinions aren’t being skewed with the intent of pleasing an advertiser, I absolutely love my AirPods Pro, and I take them with me just about everywhere. I’m on my second pair, because they are easy to lose due to their compact case, but that small profile is also a big part of why I love these earbuds, so it’s a bit of a paradox. If you can see, this won’t be much of a problem for you, but if you’re visually-impaired, it’s another story. With that said, the AirPods Pro are capable of being used with Apple’s “Find My” app, but you have to be pretty close to the case for this feature to be beneficial if you have a visual impairment. Keep in mind that I’m also deaf in one ear, so your mileage may vary here, but I just don’t think the sound is strong enough to truly tout this as an outstanding feature; I’d say the “FindMy” capability is more of an afterthought that Apple added to increase the length of the “features” list for these earbuds. But I’ll save the rest of my opinions until the wrap-up at the bottom of this post. Let’s get into some facts. What’s in the box?   First of all, the packaging for the AirPods Pro lives up to the standard we’ve come to know as Apple has grown into the Titan of a company that it is. It’s sleek, compact, and satisfying to open. Inside the box, you’ll find your AirPods Pro and accompanying charging case, three different sizes of the silicone tips that form the seal necessary for effective noise cancellation, one lightning to USB-C cable, and some documentation. Features  With the price being around 80dollars more than the AirPods with charging case, it’s a no-brainer  that the AirPods Pro are the better choice, whether you’re in need of noise cancellation or you just have an extra 80 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you’re about to see why. Comfort and Convenience  Being someone who owns a pair of ears that don’t cooperate with standard Apple earbuds very well, the comfort and secure fit provided by the silicone tips of the AirPods Pro are almost at the top of my list when it comes to benefits of these earbuds. With only three size choices, you may feel that two different sizes provide the same level of comfort and sound quality, but the AirPods run a “fit test” during setup to determine which of the tips are the perfect fit for you. The only feature that tops the comfort of the AirPods Pro is their ability to seamlessly alternate between the noise cancellation and transparency modes.  On top of these two stand-out features, Voiceover users won’t notice any latency between executing gestures on-screen and their devices’ TTS output, which is a somewhat common occurrence with other Bluetooth headphones. Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode Living in the heart of the city, I constantly switch between the two modes while I travel with my cane, as I come to street crossings and need to hear traffic, or when I’m on long spans of uninterrupted sidewalk, where I can block-out the sounds of the city while I make my way to my next crossing. And, while the noise cancellation of the AirPods Pro is incredible for their size, I do want to note that they don’t provide as much soundproofing as an over-the-ear headphone, like the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones. And if you’re curious, you can find my review of those headphones here. On the other hand, when in transparency mode, the AirPods utilize both their inward and outward-facing microphones to bypass the sound-masking that comes with having standard earbuds in your ears, leaving ones’ ability to hear their surroundings unimpeded. And when I say unimpeded, I mean it; when it comes to listening to my surroundings, the transparency mode provides a level of clarity I haven’t experienced with another pair of earbuds- and especially not with over-the-ear headphones. Sweatproof  I also wear my AirPods Pro when I lift weights, and on my way both to and from my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym: Two times when there is a lot of sweat and a lot of movement, and so far, their sweat/splashproof design has withstood everything I’ve subjected them to. It’s not uncommon for me to wash them under a faucet, and again, they still work just fine. I haven’t submerged them into a vessel of water though, and Apple has outlined that this would surpass the limits of the AirPods resiliency. Battery life and Charging case  While I haven’t been able to find any specific details as to the battery life of the charging case itself, one comparison article I found stated that the standard AirPods can be used for 4.5 hours before needing to be charged by their case, while the AirPos Pro will survive for 5.5 hours. Do keep in mind that these measurement are approximate, as the battery life may vary greatly, depending on distance from the connected device, volume level, mode, and many other factors. Alright, but how do they sound?  My AirPods Pro deliver a surprising level of sound quality, whether I’m listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or music. They are undeniably the best pair of earbuds I’ve ever owned, and I’ve had a hard time transitioning back to standard Bluetooth earbuds at times when my Airpods Pro are charging. Spoken-word content sounds crisp and professional, with no fuzziness looming around the speaker’s voice, so I’m not often distracted by poor audio quality, unless I have an unstable wi-fi connection. And, the AirPods Pro even add an extra layer of depth to stories that have occasional music or sound effects entwined throughout their duration.  Finally, when listening to music, the AirPods Pro have a surprising amount of power; I haven’t had the feeling that I’m missing any part of a song because of their bass output when in noise cancellation mode. However, When in noisier settings with other music in the background, like at a public gym, I do find myself longing for my aforementioned, over-the-ear  Bose headphones, because I can hear too much of the gym’s music over my own. Wrapping Up  If you know you want to buy a pair of wireless earbuds, I can’t recommend the AirPods Pro enough. While I do believe they are a tad pricey, inflated prices come with the territory when it comes to Apple products, and I feel like I’ve gotten my moneys worth from these earbuds. With that said, if you’ve decided it’s time to track-down a pair for yourself, I suggest shopping around. While prices fluctuate everywhere, several articles I’ve skimmed mentioned that Amazon occasionally offers much-better AirPods and AirPods Pro deals than Apple.', 'Wanted to really like them, but ears had some allergic reaction to the silicon used and made my inner ears very itchy. First time this has happened and I’ve used numerous in ear earphones from Shure to Bose to cheap $5 ones from JetBlue airlines and never had this issue. Would have loved to keep them and was wondering using them and getting rid of me other earphones/headphones. The only other thing that really annoyed me is that similar to my non pro AirPods, they also can only connect to a single device at a time. What the heck!! My Bose supports at least 2 devices at once (iPhone + laptop). So inconvenient. Had to return due to the allergy issues. Googled online, others had same isssue. Be careful. Can lead to possible in ear infections.  Thankfully, I noticed the itching early and put two to two and realized it was an allergic reaction.  After stopped using, itchy immediate went away.', '', 'Ok, so it could be all the wifis around me.  Or it could be that I live in a small town.  But I hate wireless.  My Android-using friends are looking at my expensive collection of apple products askance.  I have two sets of pros and one set of pods, and they all have the same problem: at any time, unpredictably, during a phone call, all of a sudden both people in a call will hear 1-10 seconds of electronic \"garbling,\" kind of like static.  No one can communicate anything effectively.  I do hypnosis by phone, it\\'s my career, and this is massively problematic.  10 seconds in a hypnosis call is a LONG TIME.  I\\'ve been to the apple store and had both sets of pros replaced.  NO IMPROVEMENT.  None.  Further, when I listen to music, it just stops, out of nowhere, randomly, for a second or two or three or more at a time.  Sometimes it drops altogether and I have to press play again.  I\\'ve set my apple watch to airplane mode, thinking its activity was interfering with my phone\\'s bluetooth.  I\\'ve turned my apple watch *off*.  Not that I should have to do either.  Didn\\'t work.  I even gave up on my perfectly fine iphone 11 pro max and spent $1,600 on a 13 pro max, thinking it must be a problem with the 11 and I didn\\'t want to deal with the process of a repair (I work on my phone, remember, so I can\\'t just have it gone for a week to 10 days being repaired).  I\\'ve been on the phone with customer support for hours and hours.  I reset my 11 back to factory settings.  I\\'ve unpaired and re-paired.  Nothing works to make these $250 airpods pro or their predecessor airpods, work.  Problem must be with just apple, itself, since everything sounds like trash with iphone.  I\\'m so disappointed, thinking of selling every iphone product I own, and switching to android or whatever else is out there, if iPhone can\\'t even handle basics.  Lots of people don\\'t live in cities.  Lots of people live in apartments.  that shouldn\\'t make call quality this bad.', 'Meh. I got my first AirPods recently. I was thrilled with them. So much better than corded headphones. I upgraded to these because they are supposed to be “better”. Not really. They are less comfortable. They fall out all the time. They are slimey and gross feelings when sweaty. The noise cancellation is real. It’s amazing how much it cuts out though I rarely want to be cut off like this. I can’t hear the doorbell (I literally missed being informed about a gas leak in my neighborhood because of this) and it’s dangerous on a bike. If you leave it open for ambient noise there’s a lot of crackling sounds from wind or it shifting in your ear. Also the mic seems poorer - or at least my family complains more they can’t understand me more often with these than the previous hard AirPods ( the ones without the silicone ear piece.)', 'First off it’s Apple, the only thing they are going to disappoint is your wallet. The sound is superb for wireless earphones. Clear phone calls and overall bluetooth connectivity. Sound quality is amazing, music sounds very vibrant and rich using these earphones, although they do lack bass and any kind of EQ adjustments from Apple. For that reason, they’re not a big go to for my gym workouts even with the wide variety of genres I listen to. The noise cancellation is really good without that cabin pressure that most others leave you feeling like. Transparency mode coupled with how soft and light these are, honestly feels like your ears are naked both in comfort and how natural everything sounds. Great product by Apple, gym sessions with these should be reserved to light weight high rep weight lifting days maybe some moderate to  low intensity cardio days or if you just go to stretch with some occasional lunges or high knees haha. They’re good but bass makes the world turn or get you that extra 2-3 reps on days you need it! Lol', \"My left airpod died after 5 weeks of light use - no sound was coming out of it whatsoever. These never left my desk - a hardware failure after such light usage is not great. Unfortunately I was two weeks out of the return window, and I had to deal with Apple's notoriously bad online customer service because of COVID. Even if this issue is resolved I'm going to give these away to a family member and get a cheaper pair of buds with better build quality. The noise cancelling itself isn't great, it couldn't filter out some sounds that noise cancelling headphones are supposed to excel at, like air conditioners or airplane noise. In terms of the headphones while they were still working, the sound quality was average - muddy and mid-range heavy. Definitely not as good as some other noise cancelling buds I've tried. I had to play around with some EQ apps to get an acceptable range. The three tips that came with the buds weren't great either - some days the airpods would stay in, and others they would fall out at the slightest movement. Battery life was good though.\", \"I love the Apple products that I have since they are very well integrated and are usually high quality.  You do pay a premium for that though.  The air pod pros sound great and the noise cancelling is really good.  My issues are that they have quirks and some quality issues.  I think they tried to put too much in such a tiny package and the software is still a little buggy.  I had to get a replacement pair after about 2 months because the left air pod stopped working.  Also, the integration with the Apple watch has some issues.  Using the timer when trying to workout will stop any musing you have playing if your air pods are connected to your phone.  If you connect to the watch, then the music will keep playing once you stop the timer alarm.  That's just weird.  Sometimes when a call comes in and I'm connected to my watch listening to music, only the left air pod will function when I restart playing my music.  I have to disconnect and reconnect to the watch to get both to work again. Overall I still like them, but they certainly are not without certain really annoying behavior.  Far from a seamless experience.\", \"I've used Apple headphones for years. I've used them for countless miles when I did cross country or hitting the gym. I remember when they were just circular knobs (corded), and then eventually got remote controls on the cord itself, and eventually evolved into wireless. I've ran thousands of miles outdoors with Apple headphones and years in the gym. I've had the original AirPods since they first came out 3ish years ago and they were a great step. Easy design, simple, but the batter life didn't last too long. Now I bought myself the AirPod Pros about 6-9 months ago and I'm very happy overall. Let's start with the Cons to get them out of the way: - It's difficult to do software updates. You NEED an iPhone to get the latest firmware. I wish you could download iTunes on your computer and update them after plugging in. - You don't get all the features if you use Android vs iPhone. This is to be suspected and completely fair, but frankly the most important features can be used regardless of device. - The silicone earbuds are TERRIBLE. They are very light weight and soft. Luxury feel to them... However, as your ears start to sweat, even just sitting around, they become slippery and will fall over with ease. Laying down or tilting over will make them fall out. You must get them in just right and be relatively steady to have them stay in without the need for adjustment. Especially when going out on runs with these. I did buy some after-market foam earbuds and they've resolved this issue immensely. Hopefully Apple will release better earbuds with superior slip-resistant material. Let's get to the Pros: -The sound is definitely superior to the original AirPods. Very rich and fairly good bass. Don't expect a ton of base because they're only earbuds, but you'll be surprised with what these can product. -The noise cancellation is much better than I expected. Washing dishes? Not a problem. Running outside and want to drown out traffic? Not a problem. Going on a bike ride on a windy day? Not a problem. To be clear, these do not completely drown out your surroundings, but you're going to be happy. The goal was clearly to make a design that doesn't force you to blast the volume. I can keep my volume on low and be pretty satisfied. If I go to medium or higher, then I definitely don't hear anything. -The controls are easy to use. I can quickly go between transparent mode and noise cancellation, even with Android phone. The controls are on the pods themselves, so no phone use is necessary unless you're changing songs (again - Android specific). -You have the ability to use one earbud if desired. It sounds odd, but you can put one AirPod in and set the mode to either transparent or noise cancellation. This is great for work if you want to listen to music in one ear and hear it fairly well with noise cancellation, but have your other ear completley open. -The transparency mode functions very well. If I want to listen to my music at medium volume and still interact with the local human in Walgreens, I can do so. The microphone picks up nearby sounds and voices, then plays it alongside the music. Overall, I am very happy with them. I am really disappointed in the material of the earbuds (comes with Small, Medium, and Large) since they fall out easily. However, I bought aftermarket (non-Apple) foam buds and they have resolved this issue. This has helped the AirPod Pros stay in and be used for what they're meant for: a lightweight music listening experience.\", 'Ok so here’s a long story but I hope it helps. Had a pair of air pod Pros and after almost 2 years I lost them, wanted a pair quickly because I use them in my day to day, found out amazon had an almost 50 USD discount I decided to buy them on amazon. Since I live outside of the US I use a freight forwarder this means that 2 day shipping +7 more days for the airpods to arrive, all the time in the world to doubt of my purchase, since i always buy apple in apple. Amazon ships the item with a Serial Code that if you put on Apple an error will appear. After almost 2 days thinking I was just scammed (without having the airpods of course) I realized that the Serial Code amazon ships with has an extra letter in the beginning, if you take that number off, the correct serial number can be verified. I received my Airpod Pros and immediately got my cellphone out and started to look at all the details to see if I was scammed. 100% authentic Airpods, take it from me, a nervous buyer. I even took my airpods to the local Apple Store to verify and they confirmed them.', 'As big of a conglomerate as Apple is. As much R&D that they put into their electronics. WHY on God’s green earth are their earbuds so terrible. I never used the old wired earbuds because it was like cramming a marble into my ears. They would never stay. So the AirPods came out and they were all the rage. But they weren’t made any different; so there was no way I was going to spend that type of money on plastic rocks that wouldn’t stay in my ears. So along comes the AirPods Pro. I’m thinking, “Alright! Apple has finally got it figured out! These will stay in my ears!” WRONG!! To Apple: It doesn’t matter how amazing your technology is, if the damn things won’t stay in your ears, they’re useless! I’ve got cheapo $14 wired earbuds I got at Wal Mart that stay in my ears a million times better than these POS. How are they better? They actually go down INTO the ear canal. All your junk does is rest on the outside; and the silicone tip is useless if you have to keep cramming them back into your ears because you feel them falling out. Not to mention how dang sore it makes your ears by doing that. For the love of God FIX this problem. I’ve ordered some memory foam aftermarket tips in the hopes that they’ll work. But I’m not overly optimistic. Ridiculous for the money these things cost.', \"These headphones have replaced all other headphones in my life.  I used to use a very expensive pair of Bose QC25 headphones when flying.  I was skeptical that these would cancel out the crying babies and chatterboxes sitting in the seat behind you, but these do work!  The sound quality is great.  Unfortunately, if you are flying more than 5 hours at a time, you may want to have a backup pair of headphones as the low battery warning did come up on a nonstop flight from Maui to San Diego. One thing I really love about these headphones is that you can use them independently of each other, so if you're working from home all day, you can put the left one in and use it until the battery dies, and then switch to the right one while putting the left one back in the charging case.  This is also very helpful when I'm out cycling as I don't want to cancel noise when I'm riding my bike, you want to be able to hear the cars and pedestrians and be 100% aware of your surroundings at all time. For conference calls at work, these work perfectly.  I use a MacBook Air, and Zoom and all of my calls are clear and I have had zero complaints from any of my coworkers.  These seem to do a great job of cancelling out most background noises as well which is very helpful when working from home!  One thing I recommend when you're using these with multiple devices (i.e. iPhone and MacBook Air) is to turn the bluetooth off on your iPhone while using them with your MacBook Air to avoid any confusion on where they should connect.  For the most part, they work well, but occasionally I notice some interference when I have the bluetooth turned on my iPhone when I'm using them with the MacBook Air. The integration between Apple products here is fabulous and I love that there are AirPod controls built into my Mac in the menu bar at the top right of the screen.  You can also see the charge level of your headphones by clicking on the Bluetooth icon on your Mac which is very handy. My only complaint with this product is comfort and fit.  Some days my ears are ok with having these in all day, but other days my ears like to complain a bit after having them in for long periods of time.  I guess that's a friendly reminder to me that I need to take a break from using them.  Even using the Apple fit tool, I found that it said my fit was good, but I needed to use the large tip in one ear, and the medium in my other ear.  Overall, it works, but occasionally these can still fall out of your ears.  They never fall out of my ears when cycling, but if you're doing CrossFit workouts they may fall out.  There are companies here on Amazon that make foam tips that some users have mentioned fit better than the Apple silicone ones.  Overall, I haven't found the fit or comfort too much of an issue to make me want to try other tips. Range wise, these are great, I can go to the kitchen and get some coffee and come back to my desk.  Granted, I live in a single story house.  If you live in a larger home with multiple stories you may not be able to roam that far, but that's not a limitation of this product, it's a limitation of bluetooth in general.  It's really easy to connect back to your iPhone and now Zoom supports switching back and forth so if I need to wander further I can switch the zoom call to my iPhone, connect the AirPods to the iPhone and disconnect from the laptop and be able to walk away. Last but not least, let's talk about the sound quality.  I'm pretty picky about my sound quality.  I use Sonos speakers at home, and I've always been a huge fan of the Bose headphones as well as the Sony ones.  I have NEVER been able to find a pair of in-ear headphones that fit perfectly and I've bought everything from the high end expense Klipsch ones to Shure to the original AirPods (not the pro).  The sound quality on the AirPods Pro is much better than any other in ear headphone I've used.  You can hear a lot of details in your music that you normally wouldn't hear.  With that said, they aren't the best, but when you look at the overall experience and convenience, they are my go-to headphones.  When you want audiophile quality, nothing beats a CORDED pair of headphones plugged directly into your audio system (Bluetooth does NOT support HD audio, so if you want to use the new Apple HD audio you can't with these headphones).  I did a test with my Bose QC25 connected directly to my iPhone listening to several HD audio albums and then compared to the AirPods Pro.  I barely noticed a difference.  Most human ears will not be able to hear the difference, so unless you're really fussy you probably won't notice any difference in audio quality. One thing that disappointed me about this device is that the original one did not come with MagSafe charging, although the updated model does come with MagSafe charging.  You have to be careful to properly seat the headphone case on your wireless charger, make sure you see the light come on, or your headphones may not get charged.  Of course, you can always use the lightning cable to charge them instead.  Charging these does not take long, and the case actually charges the headphones 2-3 times before you need to charge the case! I'm looking forward to seeing what Apple does next with this amazing device.  These are durable, I've dropped them on hard pavement several times and they do not even have a scratch on them.  I also had one fall out of my ear and into my cup of coffee and I dried it off for 24 hours and charged it back up and it still works PERFECTLY!  (So, in my opinion you don't need the AppleCare with these).  To avoid loosing them ALWAYS put them back in the case when you're done using them and make sure you turn on the find my AirPods function which is similar to find my iPhone and other features!\", \"These are hands down the most comfortable in ear earphones I've used. Whatever Apple did with ventilation really worked, and I don't feel the pressure I do with most in ear earphones. Noise cancelling is also fantastic and is actually very close to my Bose QC35 in most use cases. However...these sound like garbage. The bass is too strong, the mids are muddy, and highs are nonexistent. I actually think the regular Airpods sound better since their open design creates a clearer soundstage (not that they sound great either, but they're better than these). For this reason, I really wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for something that sounds good. The features are nice, but I cant get over how bad they sound.\", \"The Apple AirPods Pro have many flaws, but I will get right to the three big ones. (1) One earphone stopped charging. This was the last drop that prompted me to return them and to write this review. (2) Prior to that, there was a dramatic difference in how fast the two earphones lost power - one would be still charged at 60% while the other would drop to 20%. Various online solutions were sought and tried, and none helped. (3) The charging case is not compliant with wireless charging. It does not stop trying to charge the battery and keeps heating up after its battery has been fully charged. This is both a hazard and bad for the batteries in the case and in the earphones. Other problems with this product include the non-intuitive, inconsistent user interface. For example, bringing the case to the phone and opening the case does different things depending on whether the earphones are inside the case, outside of the case, both inside the user's ears, or one inside and one not inside a ear. The good thing about these earphone is their sound quality and noise cancellation, and acceptable (though not that long) expected battery charge life. However, given the problems encountered above (which apparently many other users online are also encountering, as I did), this product is barely usable and a great disappointment. Back to the seller it goes.\", 'Back in the day us Boomers used to laugh at \"Italian product design\" meaning designers had put a premium on looks and styling over functionality. This is true of the Airpod line. When they first came out I was excited about the seamless integration with Apple products. Check. That works mostly right most of the time with a couple glaring oversights too. It\\'s the look and functionality. Sleek. Slippery. And everyone in the world has ears that perfectly round pieces of silicon will fit in either small medium or large. Sorry. JUST like the generation 1\\'s these fall out of my ears constantly. Doesn\\'t matter what size silicone tip I wear. I tried all three. They fall out . They fall out. They fall out. I don\\'t have cauliflower ear. I do grapple occasionally but no MMA ears. I have normal ears. Also relying on something jammed in your ear is not a comfortable or reliable way to wear a device that you want to not think about. It hurts after a short time. Why not put a friggin\\' over ear band to hold them (Like plantronics FIT)? I can wear the Plantronics for 24 hours with no discomfort. I love the functionality. But the wearability is awful---- update after several months of use --- THESE ARE JUNK. You are a fool to spend a dollar on these. The sound is good when they are jammed tight into your ear, but that doesn\\'t last very long, and it\\'s painful. I will NEVER EVER buy junk from this line again. You can\\'t walk across a room without them working themselves loos and falling out. God forbid you need to bend over or take a leak. They\\'ll fall on hard floors or water without any thought to their beautifully packaging and sleek look. My left one fell out yesterday and now it won\\'t hold a charge above 4%... JUNK!!!! These are times of self-delusion so I\\'m not surprised these are so popular and people are fighting each other to throw their money away on these. I want my money back... and an apology for the frustration and bad performance of this JUNK!', 'Honestly, I was a little bit spectacle about purchasing this AirPods, because I know the original ones are just like the wired Apple earphones, where you can hear the sounds from outside and I did not want to spend 100$+ for earphones that can hear outside! Smh So I did my research diligently (for weeks). Finally decided to purchase the AirPods pros for my birthday especially because I love Apple and after my LG TONE Pro HBS-770 broke down within 10 months smh, never buying again. I am a huge audiophile and especially when it comes to picture and sound; I look for the best. I tested both LG and AirPod Pro and the Pros comes in first because it does block out any noise from the outside - I would say mostly 80%. I also hear that it adapts to the sound to actively block out any noise outside especially when I shop: I can’t hear my footsteps, the people around, the car on the streets. It’s amazing! Plus I can leave them in my ear and they are so comfortable, especially when I’m on the treadmill they stick like glue! Plus it helps with the sweat resistant feature the AirPods provide! Sometimes I forget they are in my ear lol also the transparency mode works well so I don’t have to remove my earphones (but seriously I’m listening to music why are you talking to me) lol I also love switching between Noise cancellation and transparency modes. Golden. Even when the modes for Off, the sound is still particularly good. My recommendation is that if you are or not an audiophile and you want to purchase AirPods, go for the AirPod Pros. You won’t be disappointed. 249$ it can be high, but it’s money well spent. It’s better to spend a little more or a lot more to get what you want versus spending 100$ less and you aren’t satisfied.... life is too short! Enjoy while you can :D Plus 249$, I mean... we spent 249$ on anything else :P', \"I wanted to like these, I really did. I have the original AirPods and I absolutely love them. But they were lacking in a few ways, primarily in no noise cancelation and they (supposedly) are not sweat resistant. I use them for conference calls at work and when I work out (to listen to music) so those features (or lack thereof) are pretty important to me. When I first heard about the AirPods Pro they seemed like the bridge that closed these gaps and I was willing to pay extra money to get them (even more than usual since the 3rd party I purchased from thru Amazon was selling them at marked up price of $299). Sadly, they effectively do not work. The sound quality is good enough and the noise cancelation is noticeable when compared to the original AirPods; nothing that really wowed me but an improvement. The deal breaker for me is that they will not stay put, no matter which size I use or how I position them. I put them in for a conference call and as I talk they begin to push out eventually popping out of my ear completely. I put them in to wear around the house while listening to music and without any movement in my face at all, they still eventually popped right out. I haven't tried them while working out because the last thing I need is for one to pop out while I'm running and fall under foot to get crushed. I didn't want to rule out that my ears are the defective ones, so I let 3 other people try them: popped them in their ears (tried each size), talked for about 3 minutes, POP! out came the AirPods each and every time. Ear buds that don't stay place during extremely common use are, essentially, a defective product in my opinion. A few other flaws to mention, that weren't necessarily dealbreakers on their own: 1. There are currently no Apple approved protective cases so you have to go with pretty cheap cases on Amazon; considering how pricey the AirPods are this might be a problem for some people so wanted to mention it. 2. They are extremely difficult to get out of the case because of the size/ shape of them; I had to turn the case upside down and tap them out. 3. They are not at all comfortable. I would not need to wear them for extended periods of time so this would've been okay if they actually stayed put the way ear buds need to. I'm a devoted Apple fan, perhaps to a fault; I was so excited for this product and really hate to rate them so badly. But they just don't cut it as the product they claim to be; certainly not at the price you pay for them. I'll  keep my fingers crossed the future iterations of the AirPods pro work.\", 'The AirPods Pro stopped charging after 5-6 uses, within 2 months of purchase (August, 2021). This probably was a failure of the charging case. While I am sympathetic to product failures, 2+ weeks without a status update is a significant decline compared to the standards Apple set in the past. Apple\\'s excuse: \"The request is delayed because of a Back Ordered Service Part (BOSP). As you may be aware, there are several industries around the globe, such as manufacturing and shipping, that are impacted by current events. We\\'re working hard to minimise the impact to our customers, but we\\'re expecting some delays in shipping equipment. We do, however, want to thank you for your patience as we work through this and be assured that the customer will receive their replacement/device/etc. \" Meanwhile, this product is widely available by retail, ready for pickup tomorrow. While the supply chain is their excuse, Apple\\'s priority here is transparent — new sales. Customers are at the back of the line.', 'Wanted to love these, but is a major fail. Buds take 2 hours to charge. The case takes over 5 hours to charge!!! Even with a power delivery charger. This is insane. Called Apple support and they couldn’t answer how long it should or shouldn’t take. My AirPods one took 1 hour to charge and buds would charge completely in matter of 20 minutes. The sound is great, clients can clearly hear me, but I’ll need two pairs of these to not be with or without one while the other is charging. Am completely baffled about the choices Apple made in designing this product and their ability to provide clear guidance and support. For $250 I expected more. Makes me consider finally getting off iphone all together but can’t stand being forced to have google track me as soon as I boot up an Android for the first time.', 'I am sadly disappointed with this design. I really wanted to love these headphones & follow the cool kids, but I have to be honest with myself & admit for as much as they cost, these headphones suck! Sound quality & comfort would have to be key points in my choice of headphones & these lack in BOTH departments. The sound is mediocre compared to what I already had with my Beats X! The shape of the headphones are very odd & bulky! I have daith rings in my ears & I have to completely remove them in order for these to fit. Once I got them in, they make my ears VERY sore after wearing them a little while. I have a job that allows me to wear my headphones & listen to music for the majority of my day, anywhere from 4-8hrs a day & these are super uncomfortable even with the smallest rubber fitting. The rubber fitting also wouldn’t stay on one of the headphones so the stupid thing kept getting lodged in my ear & I’d have to pull it out with tweezers 😳. Transparency is unnecessary to me. When I used them to workout they kept starting to fall out, especially once I started sweating. I don’t like Siri so I hate that you have to ask her to turn the volume up & down! Otherwise you have to use your phone itself.  The list goes on! I’m going back to Beats X!', \"Long story short I lost my airpod pros. Saw these on major discount ($90 for Black Friday), and couldn't resist. So here's my take in four parts. Sound Quality. Noise Cancelling. Ambient pass through. Features. Sound quality -- versus the airpod pros, these are almost identical in sound. The only difference is the beats buds are a touch bass heavy. It's good, punchy bass, but noticeably more than the pros which were more balanced with its lows. So if you're a bass head, or hip-hop enthusiast, the beats win hands down. Noise cancelling -- now this could have to do with the shape of my ear, but I found the beats to actually be a step ABOVE in noise cancelling. My gf still has her airpods and I compared. The seal the beat creates, paired with its noise cancelling makes it seem like the world doesn't exist. Beats win for me in NC. Ambient pass-through -- this is where the beats lose out. Their noise cancelling is too good. So even when you have transparency turned on the world sound a little muddied out, while with the airpods, if I had transparency on it was almost like I wasn't wearing them. I miss that alot. So if you are in an environment where you need to hear what people are saying without removing your buds then airpods might be your pick. It's not to say that beats mak you deaf or anything but things are just noticeably quieter in transparance vs airpods with its full clarity. Features -- another loss for the beats. They don't work with the beats app so no equalizer function... why beats???? WHY?? So you'll have to go third party if you want to equalize. The beats also won't stop the music or video you're watching if one falls out. No biggy for me as I like that but some people might not. Other than that it has similar functionality to airpods. One click to pause, two to skip, etc. It doesn't auto switch between devices but does actually switch pretty similarly. Takes maybe two clicks to switch it to my mac. The pairing is a breeze with iphones. Just open the case next to your iphone and voila. It's paired.\", 'I\\'ve owned the original AirPods, AirPods 2, and now AirPods Pro. I read or heard the comment it\\'s $50 more for the AirPods Pro over the wireless charging AirPods 2. Well, it\\'s more like $85 difference now with the price drop. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s temporary or not. Still are the AirPods Pro worth it? I would say yes. If you had trouble getting the previous models to fit or stay in your ears then it\\'s a big \"YES!\". The Active Noise Cancellation works great. At first I thought it didn\\'t work. I turned on Transparency and I can say with certainty it works incredibly well for earbuds. Is it perfect? No, there is some light sound leakage that I hear. If you have the volume past 60% or so, it\\'s not really that noticeable. When walking. I have one earbud set to Transparency. Something not mentioned is how it \"feels\", when you have ANC on then off. It\\'s a bit eerily or disorientating at first. You have to get use to it. It sort of feels like when I tried 3D glasses and took them off. You had to readjust for things to be \"normal.\" Sound quality is better and it should be because it creates a seal, when you have them in properly. The controls are simple. Squeeze the stem on the earbuds to pause/play. Squeeze twice to skip. Squeeze and hold to turn on Transparency mode. Or if you\\'re lazy then ask Siri. You can find the right fit with the ear tips optimization by tapping the Information icon in BlueTooth. It would have been nice to use foam tips but that won\\'t happen for now. You\\'re stuck with the Apple silicone tips due to the design. Things not mentioned in any or most reviews I read or watched online. A subtle change most users won\\'t think about is that the speaker grille is not recessed like the previous models. Why does that make a difference? If you\\'ve used the previous generation of AirPods, things like ear wax, dust, debris get trapped in those areas making it pretty disgusting. Even Dr Pimple Popper might be offended by how gross it is. Not a problem anymore. Also, I recommend AppleCare but a smart tip is to buy it close to the 60 days after the purchase. That\\'s the amount of time you have to get AppleCare. The shelf life of the earbuds is about 2 years or so. My first gen died about 18 months later, so definitely worth getting AppleCare since it\\'s only $29. Trust me the benefits are worth the extra cost.', \"I bought these to help block out distracting office noise.  Unfortunately (and ironically), the noise cancelling algorithm on these actually make the distractions worse.  The AirPods Pro removes the white noise that had been masking conversations and abrupt sounds.  With them in, it's actually harder to concentrate.  I truly hope the magicians at Apple can improve the noise cancellation program via firmware update.  It is not in the same league as Bose and Sony at this point.  It is also not as customizable. As far as sound quality goes, I had been scared by other reviewers into thinking these were absolute garbage.  I'm happy to say that's not the case.  They are generally balanced and pleasant to listen to.  The bass is present but not over-accentuated.  The mids and highs are also present but not irritating.  It's close to being good.  There are better options out there, obviously.  My favorite pair of wireless ears is the Bose SoundSport Wireless, which is, by the way, cheaper and more appropriate for working out.  Apple's sound should have a bit more low frequency extension and more customizability.  By the way, having a good tight fit in crucial to achieving proper low-end response on any in-ear headphone.  So if the bass sounds weak to you, try a bigger tip and make sure to push it in snugly! As far as the mic, it's OK.  It sounds about like you'd expect.  Everything else works pretty flawlessly.  The charging case is easy and intuitive.  Putting them in your ears (one or both) is easy and intuitive.  Pairing them was a breeze.  They look pretty good too, if that's important to you. It's a 50/50 toss up now if I return them or not.  I already have better sound in the Bose SoundSport Wireless, and these are not adding the noise cancelling functionality I was hoping for. UPDATE: It may be placebo effect, but I think the most recent firmware update really has helped the noise cancelling feature on these perform better.  They are still not on par with Sony's technology, but it seems better.  You just have to add a little noise from the Coffetivity app or the White Noise app to further drown out the office noise.\", 'I’m a huge Apple phone and own all kinds of products from iPhone, watch, original airpods, iPads, MacBooks etc.  This is the first time I have returned a product and the first time I felt Apple truly failed at product design. Sound qualify was amazing and I really like the noise cancellation.  The problem you ask?  The fit is terrible.  I tried all 3 provided sizes of the grips and these things won’t stay in my ears.  One workout they fell out all over the place on every set.  I wore them to talk to my friends for a couple hours and my ears hurt so bad I had to rotate one and the other out.  I’m sorry but what the hell were you thinking Apple?  Read the internet and there are tons of people with this problem.  You have always created products with the mass market in mind and this is not it.  Garbage!', 'First, these are authentic headphones for anyone asking. These also work with android devices if you’re wondering. I don’t use them in android but I’ve heard they are better on Android than they are on the iPhone (go figure). Anyway, the noise cancellation is so good on these that I used them for ear protection while I was on a site and one of the guys was running a saw through concrete in an enclosed area. Didn’t think they’d be that good but they sure are. I also like that it reads my text messages to me and I can reply to them without grabbing my phone. The Siri integration is superb and one of my favorite features next to the battery life. Get these headphones because the new AirPods coming out will not have noise cancellation as a feature (yay Apple). These will be the AirPods you want because they will still be the top tier item even after the launch of the new version.', 'First off, I would like to give props to Apple for doing a great job with their noise cancelling and transparency modes. They work and sound great. The audio quality is great. BUT HERE ARE THE REASONS WHY I GAVE 2 STARS: The biggest issue is the fit. The AirPod Pro’s will slide and fall out of your ear no matter what size earbud you have on. This is a very common issue for users. If you don’t believe me just google “AirPods falling out”. Most people either have to spend additional money on aftermarket ear buds or some people have luck by turning their AirPods about 30-50 degrees. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY $200 FOR A PRODUCT THAT DOESN’T FIT WITHOUT SPENDING ADDITIONAL MONEY ON AFTERMARKET PARTS. The headphones fall out even when you are just sitting there doing nothing. Do you want to do any sort of activity (including taking a leisurely stroll)? Expect your AirPods to fall out without warning. “What happens when they do fall?” Well on their first fall from my ears (about 6 feet) inside my house they got multiple dents.  This happened the very first time I put them on. My second discrepancy is that they will randomly disconnect or connect to a different device. Example: there have been many occasions where I will be in a zoom meeting on my laptop and all of the sudden they disconnect for absolutely no reason and are stubborn out Reconnecting. Overall: unless money grows on trees or they improve their fit design by increasing the length of the ear bud away from the stem DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.', 'The sound quality was great. I\\'m no audiophile, but low-frequency bass is present and sounds good, and highs are just as present and also sound clear/natural. Fit/Retention: I caught the earbuds falling from my ears multiple times during a low-impact workout after I had started to sweat. I tried to preempt that condition by adjusting them often when I felt them starting to slip out...but that was almost more annoying than just catching them when they started to fall out. Note to Apple: Just buy Comply tips...or for that matter...buy the entire company and make their tips standard for your devices. Your silicone tips are garbage...along with the rest of the silicone earbud tips on the market. Don\\'t advertise your earbuds as sweatproof and make your customers believe they are suitable for workouts when they definitely aren\\'t...at least not for everyone. Noise Cancelling: The first thing I tried the ANC with was my kids in the van...no dice, but it was a fun idea while it lasted. The 4 and 1-year-old will likely win over any ANC I try. My wife wasn\\'t impressed that I even tried...but I thought it would be a nice bonus for long car rides when the kids want to be loud and goofy. Transparent Mode: Very cool...and one of the selling points for me. I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder when running or biking with earbuds because I know I can\\'t hear ambient noise as well. This was the perfect solution to that problem. If it weren\\'t for the following problem...I likely would have spent additional money to make the AirPod Pros actually work for my intended purpose. Until this point, I probably would have given the Airpod Pros a 3 or 4-star review. If they shipped with better tips, I think I would have even been at a 5. That said...now I\\'ll tell you about the serious issue. The left earbud died at a rate 2-3x that of the right earbud. I completed a 50-minute workout after charging the AirPod Pros fully (with noise canceling on, volume a little over half) and the right earbud had about 3/4 battery life left. The left earbud had approximately 1/4 of battery life remaining. I don\\'t expect them to be absolutely even...but that is unacceptable...and doesn\\'t even come close to the advertised battery life. I imagine that issue is simply a factory defect. I likely wouldn\\'t have the issue with a second set if I exchanged them. That said, with the fit weirdness and the need to spend another $25+ for a decent set of tips, I can buy other similar products for the same money that are sometimes rated higher in quality/performance than the AirPod Pros. I\\'m a self-admitted Apple fan-boy. I own an iMac 27\", an iPad Pro, an Apple Watch, and an iPhone 11. I wanted to like these AirPod Pros...but they just don\\'t cut it. So...instead of having them replaced due to the battery defect...they are getting returned and I\\'ll be trying something else. Update: I decided to use the AirPods for another few days hoping the battery issue would iron out, and they would grow on me. The battery issue must have been a case of me not having realized that one side didn’t charge properly for some reason, because from that point on the AirPods batteries discharged at the same rate. I went for a run with them and I constantly had to push them back in to keep them from falling out...something that I don’t even think a new set of tips would fix. I feel like the design made retention of the devices an afterthought. It’s unfortunate because otherwise they are solid. I already own a set of sport focused earbuds from another major brand. The my don’t have transparency mode though...so I’ll be patiently waiting for a company to release wireless earbuds with ANC/Transparency, good fit/retention, and decent battery life. I’m going to increase my rating to 3 stars. I feel like the fact that they are unusable due to fit is worth taking off two stars. Otherwise, they are fine.', \"I couldn't wait for the next version of Sony WF-1000XM3 or Bose QuiteComfort Earbuds, (even if i really wanted to give them a try) and I just committed to the 2nd pair for myself. That's the 3rd purchase of Airpods Pro in my household. I got the first two as soon as they were released, and I couldn't have been happier with them. One of the earbuds developed a weird noise that couldn't be addressed in any means possible, but the RMA process was pretty straight forward and above all fast. Firmware issues have been somewhat annoying but I'm still pretty happy with the quality of the sound or the quality of the noise cancellation feature. With the lowest ever price now, there was not much hesitation in this decision to buy yet another pair. I was using a pair with both my work Macbook and my Android phone. And, I was literally switching between them a few times a day. Even with shortcuts/widgets to make the connection on both devices, it was getting quite tiring after doing it for like a year now. Besides, Airpods Pro seems to remember only up to 2 devices at a time, so it's a lot more hassle if you have a 3rd device you want to connect to. Then you have to pair again and again to switch around. Anyways, I really needed another wireless earbuds to make my life easier. My only apple product is the Macbook Pro, so I have no problem getting the firmware updated. And, a third party paid app on Android works well in providing some additional features on top of the bluetooth pairing and noise cancellation.\", 'First off, the good!  I really like the size and features these AirPods have!  They hold their charge really well, fit well in your pocket, have great noise canceling features. I really wanted to love these earphones. I have been a huge Bose fan, they have amazing sound and great ability to stay in my ears, but they were so big sticking out of my ears I looked like Frankenstein’s brother.  I hoped the size and features would win me over, and they did, except for one blaring issue—they FALL OUT all of the time!! I wondered if it was just me, but there were so many people that had the same issue, I’ve tried all the tricks without getting 3rd party adapters which makes the case worthless in most instances.  I know there are some people they work great for, but there are a lot of us in the same boat.  I wish apple had a better solution, for such an expensive set, it’s discouraging.', 'If you can rationalize the steep pride tag these will deliver an extremely enjoyable and easy to use form of music listening. Can you get a better deal? probably, but can you get a more slick and fun experience? Probably not.', 'These serve the purpose of being wireless headphones and they stay in your ears for things like conference calls and workouts. Issues: I will say that the noise cancellation quality on mine has GREATLY deteriorated since purchasing them. I went from barely being able to hear my husband standing 10ft away to being able to hear/distinguish his entire conference call from another room. One of the biggest issues/annoyances I have with these is that there is no way to mute/un-mute yourself on a call. You have to carry your phone around to go in and out on calls that way. If you\\'re walking around various kitchen appliances, something like a microwave is going to affect the signal a little. There is also no volume control; you have to do that on your phone manually as well (re: carry it with you). I personally like to sleep with headphones in too, so you\\'d need something separate for that. They\\'re not \"sleep-in\" comfortable. I would rate these as average, but there\\'s nothing \"must have\" about them that another wireless device wouldn\\'t give you.', 'Pros: Comfort/fit  - Easily the most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever used. The standard AirPods would fall out of my ears constantly and would rub my ear. These fit my ear perfectly. They are small enough for me to wear them through out the day and notice them. No irritation and no falling out of the ears Microphone and sound clarity - I use these for hands free work calls on a regular basis. The microphone sounds just as good as my iPhone 12. Also, the sound of music is as clear as you can get. However, it did lack a little bass. I personally prefer clarity over bass in most situations. Size - These are significantly smaller than any other quality wireless earbuds on the market. Noise cancellation - the noise cancellation is above par. It cancels out nearly all peripheral background noise. It’s not 100% though, nor would you want it to be. The headphones provide just enough audio feedback to understand my surroundings but blocks enough for me to hear a voice on the phone while walking through a large crowd. These will save my hearing for sure. With noise canceling, I find myself reducing song volumes by 50%. Cons Color - I really don’t like that these are white. Every little piece of ear wax is visible. The white case collects lint and dirt which is visible. The lid to the cade is magnetized and catches every single shard of metal. From my experience, the earbuds and the case will start to look dirty in just a few weeks. Pass through - These headphones are supposed to pass through volume from the outside of the appropriate setting is checked. I don’t notice a difference really. Everything still sounds like I have earplugs in my ears. This issue may be unique to me though. I have a rough time hearing with or without headphones. Regardless, this feature is a little disappointing Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds for the previously mentioned reasons. I wish I could comment on the integration with MAC. If you are a MAC user, I highly recommend you check into how these headphones can auto swap between devices.', 'The Pro version has better sound than regular AirPods (and you can choose from stereo or spacial ) and additionally have noise reduction. These are not true noise cancelling —they are noise reducing but they do a good job. You also have choices for background noise to use like white noises. Sounds like rain, ocean and more white-like noises for example. The indented bars on the stem are easy to click to change from reduction, transparency, off etc and the bars are a good size. Click bar is too easy sometimes if you try to adjust them you can easily disconnect a call.  The shorter stems are great. Once get the hang of removing the different sized ear tips they are easy to chabge—For me, none of the air tips kept them secure in my ears.  I missed the Aha tips with the ear hooks which kept the AirPods 2 in place no matter the activity.  So I found out they make them for the Pro version and bought them.  Better but not as secure as the AirPods 2 were. The one HUGE disappointment for me is that the skip back and skip forward feature (triple click to skip back and double click to skip forward) does not apply to videos. That’s the one I use most. You can only use those features for music, and audiobooks (once you configure for the books). Truly a surprising oversight since that video feature is functional for videos with AirPods 2, and for big difference in price between the pro and regular. I hope that feature comes in the future along with longer battery life (which is about 30 min shorter than AirPods). So are AirPods Pro worth it? It’s an individual decision. Yes if you don’t care about video back and forward, they fit securely in your ears, you love charging without removing silicone tips and place a priority on noise reduction and slightly better sound.', '', \"Funny thing is that I never had a problem getting the original airpods to stay in my ear, so was expecting the airpods pro to be even better given they come with three different ear tips. Oddly, these keep falling out of my ears and I've tried the medium and large tips. The actual airpod itself is much bulkier, so I guess it just doesn't sit in my ear correctly. But that's not the only issue I have with these. I also bought them because they claim better microphone sound in the wind. Unfortunately, I done a few tests while biking slowly and I don't think there is much improvements. Oddly, I've also had people complain that they wouldn't hear me or was dropping out. It wasn't my signal because when switching to phone and back they could hear me just fine. I also really miss being able to tap the airpod to answer calls or hangup. Now you have to click on the short little stem, which I've had trouble doing. I tried for days to get this used to this, but no luck. What's worse, when I would finally find the right spot to click, it would cause the airpod to fall out. Yes, there is some sound improvement and the noise cancellation is nice (although I hate the strange hallow sound it creates when talking). But if you can't keep the airpod in your ear and you can no longer tap to answer/hangup, then I'm afraid the cost/benefit isn't there. Really surprised to feel this way since I don't see many others complaining about these issues. But mine are going back.\", 'These are a huge disappointment. My old AirPods stopped working about the time they went out of warranty and I’ve been unimpressed by the sound on the Samsung ear buds that other family members have when they’ve called me. I decided to give these a try and wish I hadn’t. The battery life sucks. 2-3 hours of listening on one and about 4 on the other. I usually wear one at the time. The newest glitch is that they don’t answer the phone or control my books or music. You can mash the control button all day and nothing. It won’t answer the phone part of the time and they can’t hear me when it does answer at other times. I’ve forgotten them on my phone and reinstalled them and it helped for about two weeks. It’s past the time I can send them back so I’m stuck with them. I’m thinking about going back to wired headphones because these suck so badly. Don’t waste your money unless frustration is your thing. Worst $200 I’ve ever wasted.', \"As the result of a recent iPhone upgrade, I was forced to find a Bluetooth headphone solution. Since the original hard Apple ear bud style makes my inner ear hurt within an hour, I was optimistic to find this version has customizable ear tips. The tips themselves are much firmer than other, more comfortable ear tips I've used in the past and strangely do invert somewhat when you pull them out, likely because they are designed to form a tight seal. I do experience some discomfort in my ears if I wear them a full day, even with breaks to charge. The noise cancellation tech is dramatic, it makes working in a crowded environment much less distracting. They are a mini-vacation for an empath, as they help block the draining buzz in the world around you. It also seems to block some internal (breathing/walking) noise, as well. The transparency setting seems to amplify external noise (at least to me), so while I doubt I'll be using that setting, it may be ideal for someone who has some hearing loss or to use as a hands-free option while driving. The only issues I can see (so far) is I only get about 3-4 hours charge on the noise cancel setting especially if I'm talking on my phone, so definitely have to factor in charging during my lunch hour and once again in the late afternoon. Additionally, I do worry as the battery starts to degrade, these will quickly become useless.\", 'I think the biggest question when considering this purchase is whether or not they are worth the outlay of cash. I’ll be honest I had mine sitting in my Amazon cart for months before I finally decided to pull the trigger. Previously I had the Jabra Elite 75t I thought these were fine. Sound quality was good but they did feel bulky in my ears. It was my kids who sold me on the Apple AirPods and I will be honest I am an Apple girl. Everything else in my life is Apple. Here’s what I love… Ease-of-use How everything automatically syncs up They feel great in my ears Noise cancellation is awesome My ears are very sensitive to things being in them too long. These buds seem to fit comfortably and do not aggravate my ear canal. I could even sleep with these rive never been able to do that with anything else. They’re so light weight it’s amazing Also love the case... It has a magnetic closure No pulling your fumbling to try to open yet strong enough to stay closed when needed The feeling of the carrying case in my hand The weight of the case is fabulous Like a rubbing stone you can carry around all day LOL The design is Apple perfection as usual You can see in the picture that I added a vinyl just to make mine look different than everyone else’s. If you’re on the fence I promise you won’t regret jumping to the other side to make this purchase!', \"I have really struggled trying to find earbuds I actually like. I have a pair of wired ones that are really comfortable and sound decent--but the wire is a pain. I have another set of semi-wireless ones that are also comfy, but the sound is only okay, and they don't stay in my ears. I've tried super-expensive custom ones. And several other options. None of them hold a candle to these Airpods! The sound is fantastic, especially with the noise cancellation on. But I especially love that you can also put them on Transparency mode. I didn't understand from the description what the difference was between having noise cancellation off and Transparency mode, but when fiddling with them, I figured it out. Transparency mode allows you to hear outside sound MUCH better than just having the noise cancellation off! It's more like listening to a stereo or the speakers on your computer. A couple of other things I really love. The range is fantastic! With the other wireless earbuds I've tried, I have to stay in the same room as my device, but with these, I can walk throughout my house and still have sound! Amazing!  Also, the little vents in them keep you from hearing your voice echoing weirdly in your head, as it does with other earbuds. Especially nice not to have to hear myself swallowing when I'm drinking a cup of coffee as I listen. I have super-sensitive ears, and the hard plastic part of these earbuds is a little uncomfortable for me. (I've never been able to tolerate other Apple earbuds because of this.) However, the silicone part is great, and it's possible I will get more used to them so that I'll be completely comfortable. I suspect others would not have this problem. (I returned the expensive custom ones I ordered because my ears didn't like the hard plastic even though it was customized for their shape, so this really is likely just a quirk of mine and not a problem with the Airpods.) Overall, I'm super-pleased with them and so happy I decided to take a chance on them despite my wariness of Apple earbuds.\", \"I have had/owned and still own many wireless headsets/earbuds. If you're an apple/iOS user, Airpods are a no-brainer.  I didn't love the originals, the battery life wasn't great.  They'd be cooked on a 2 hour conference call before the call was over.  90 mins in you have to pull one pre-emptively and place it in the case to catch a charge then swap.  I figured these would be the same, but they are considerably better. For comparing the original release w/o wireless charging case, if the second gens have a better battery life then this may not apply.  But with the Pro's I can easily stay on a 3+ hour call (sounds fun doesn't it?) w/o having to charge them. The noise-canceling is nowhere near as good as Bose over the ear, maybe not even as good as the Amazon Echo buds.  but it's adequate.  I haven't taken them on a plane yet but they easily cancel out basic background noises. Anyone that tells you they don't hear people sitting next to them or loud traffic is smoking crack.  None really cover-up that type of noise. I will buy these again when I lose one.  That is the biggest downside.  They are slippery but so are the originals. That's all I have to say.  If you're an Apple fan you won't be disappointed.\", \"I have experienced and still own quite a few over the ear, in ear and true wireless headphones and buds. UE Custom, Jabra 75t and a few others are still in use. I owned the original Air Pods and ended up giving those to my wife as I found useless for a number of reasons. I picked up the Air Pod Pro's and I am absolutely impressed. I have a lot of adjustable light switches around my house and the H1 chip keeps the connection without a blimp. When my wife is home, I use earbuds (sometimes Plantronics that a waterproof that go's around my neck and sometimes the Jabra Sport 65t), I have even used the Jabra 75t and Air Pod Pro's while taking a shower. With every truly wireless earbud the connection breaks up due to the adjustable light switches in my bathroom. If I use the Air Pod Pro's the connection is as solid as using earbuds that fit around the neck. Now as far as sound. As I mentioned I have too many listening devices to list. But all of my over ear are fabulous sounding and most to my ears add little coloration or take away from the music. Even my entry level UE when I connect them directly to my iPhone or use bluetooth are really pleasing to me. Since purchasing the Air Pod Pro's I've had to purchase another set for backup. The functionality of the Air Pod Pro's with my iPhone are second to none. I've listened in every mode, noise cancelling, transparency and neither and these things just sound good to me. They let the music come through for me. I've read reviews by professional reviewers and they almost always say that when it comes to the music they're just mediocre, well to my ears, that's not true. I own some of the devices they claim sound much better. I don't own several like Sony earbuds the 1000 series, and Bose I sent back. To me the Bose are over rated. Sennheiser I wouldn't purchase another pair because of poor service, no, no service with a high end pair of connected over the ear set. Don't want to repeat myself but the Air Pods Pro is a no brainer for people with iPhones if they can fit them in their budget. They kind of pricey but less expensive to the highly rated Sennheiser thingy. And one more time the functionality with the iPhone and the sound makes them worth every penny and worth saving for and investing in.\", \"There seems to be a known manufacturing defect. There is a static/crackling problem that Apple knows about, and Apple has extended the warranty because of the problem. Mine had this problem of getting static/crackling/white noise in one earbud. If you get the problem within one year of purchase, I believe you are covered by the normal warranty. If you get the problem after one year, you might be covered by the extended warranty or you might be screwed (like me). If you get the problem after one year, Apple will run a diagnostic test and then they may or may not replace yours. In my case, there is an obvious defect, but Apple won't do anything because they claim my defect causing static is a different defect than the one they are covering with the extended warranty. That means there are two (at least) different defects that can cause static, and Apple only extended the warranty for one of those defects. As for using them, the noise cancellation is very good for an in-ear earbud. The sound quality seems good. I'm no audiophile, but my music and podcasts sound fine.  Sometimes there is a problem with one or the other not staying in my ear, but I think that's just hit or miss, and you may have to try the different sized silicone pieces to see what works best for you. If not for the defect causing static and Apple's refusal to do anything, I would give these a higher rating.\", \"These have some features I like, but I got them for the noise cancellation mostly. I have 3 bose n.c. devices, 2 headsets and their original n.c. earbuds. These are nothing at all like the bose.  They are about as bad as the amazon buds I once bought and returned. I might return these, not sure yet. The good points of this, which temps me to keep them, are the comfort (no dangling wires or battery with on/off switch of the bose) and they cost a lot less than the bose. The sound is about the same quality. With the bose, I can play a 100hz sound and if I position them just right in my ears, the sound is almost completely canceled. With these airpods, no amount of re-adjustment in the ear can create a good enough seal and the 100 hz sound file is not muted at all. A window a/c unit doesn't mute at all either. Ok, maybe just a tad, but not enough to brag about. I like the charger setup, although I have trouble getting my magnetic (color lights) charging cables to charge the case Sometimes it works, sometimes not. I don't normally buy apple stuff due to the high price, and have an android phone. It handled Bluetooth with the phone and my amazon echo's ok. I like the case, since it makes it easy to tell left vs. right. It would be better if opening the lid was a bit different, as when I place it on the table, the lid will shut w/o me wanting that, and it needs to be open during some operations and when you want Bluetooth from the case turned on. There should be an android app to let you do all the same things w/o needing an iphone. The included charging cable was useless to me, since I would need an adapter to a standard usb plug on the one side to plug into my little 5v usb chargers (those little cubes). There is one app that at least lets me check the battery levels, but it's not an apple app.\", \"I've been using the Apple AirPods Pro for three months as of this review. I use these very regularly, and I've been impressed with how they sound. More impressive is the noise cancellation. I'm new to noise-cancellation headphones, so I wasn't sure what to expect. These will filter out the sounds of birds chirping while outdoors, and and fans whirring while indoors. These won't filter out all background noise, but it's the difference that I was looking for. Apple has made an impressive set of AirPods here, and the quality and design are what I've come to expect from the company. I also love that this comes with three pair of soft rubber ear cushions to accommodate different sized ear canals. Daily use for these have proven good, and I'm amazed that these don't fall out of my ear. The way Apple design the AirPods is great, and these have very rarely fallen out of my ears at all.  Battery life has been great, and I've gone 4-hours without needing to charge these in the case. Even when I place the AirPods into the case to charge them, the case do so quickly so that I can get back to my music or podcast listening. Overall I'm thoroughly impressed with the Apple AirPods Pro, and I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a noise-cancelling solution. These have been well worth the price for me, and I definitely get my use out of them daily. Two thumbs up!\", \"The sound quality is obviously not going to be amazing, but nothing an average user would complain about. The bass is deep and the sound is not too aggressive and audio is balanced to allow me to wear it for long periods. The new stem with controls is intuitive and better than tapping the Airpods on the ear like the old ones. The active noise canceling is AMAZING. Unlike my Sony WH-1000XM2s, the transparency mode on these sound like I'm hearing outside sounds like the way they should sound, while the Sony's make it clear it's reproduced sound. Cons: 1. Easy to get dirty and scratch 2. Earbuds attract earwax and makes it a hassle to clean whenever I need to put them away. 3. Earbuds cause some slight discomfort when left on with noise-canceling 4. Pairing them with a Mac isn't always as smooth as with an iOS device\", 'When I first got these I was surprised by the eartips. I was expecting the same eartips found on the wired Apple earbuds, but I didn’t let that deter my excitement. ... until I put them on. The left earbud’s fit was not perfect, but it stayed in for the most part. The right earbud had to be adjusted every minute because it kept falling out. I tried all three eartip pieces to find the perfect fit, but none of them worked. Maybe I just have wonky ears. Because of it’s ill fit, I decided that I would wear only the left one for most uses unless I wanted a full surround/noise-cancelling experience and put up with adjusting the right ear piece. Now a month ago, about six months after I purchased these, the left earbud that I’ve been using by itself had started experiencing failure. I’ve used them about 4 hours every day and made sure to store them correctly in their case. There is a static-y noise when I move and the bass is heavily distorted to the point where it hurts my ear. In the past month I’ve tried to use the right earbud to not experience the left’s failure, but now that one has started to fail too. I’ve been a loyal Apple user for several years, but I am extremely disappointed with their Airpods Pro. For the record the sound is decent and I was a fan of the level of noise-cancelling you get from these, but for their price, the lifespan of these is abysmal. Perhaps for my audio needs I need to look elsewhere than Apple.', 'Bought these to try the transparency mode. I’ve had hearing loss in my left ear for years. I’ve missed out on many conversations and felt worthless at times due to this. My first experience using these was a visit to my medical clinic.  With everyone wearing face masks and shields, I was always asking people to repeat themselves. I was able to communicate effectively.  It was such a change, I almost cried. I could hear!! These are a quality device.  May not be the best of the high end sound quality, but are very good. I am so happy I was able to acquire a device that helps with my hearing condition without spending a huge amount, Definitely recommended!!', \"I wanted to love these. Really really love them. But so far I don't. I've been using them for about 3 months now and some features work great. The noise cancellation is great, the mic works great, the battery life is great (though I haven't tested for longer than 30 minutes at a time, get to that in just a bit). The charging case is small and pocket friendly, and wireless charging works well. The customization within an iPhone for them is fantastic, and they pair nicely with other Bluetooth devices (like my HP laptop). I mentioned not testing for longer than 30 minutes. This is because I can't stand messing with them for longer than that. I have the largest tip installed and the pods regularly slip out of my ear if I am talking. If I'm stationary and just listening, I can usually get them to stay put. The moment I start talking and moving my jaw, they start to wiggle free. I have successfully jammed them into my ears maybe 2 out of 10 times. And have dropped several calls while quickly trying to catch them and shove them back in my ear and accidentally press the stem button ending the call prematurely. I use these mostly for work calls, or at least that's the intention, and so far, they are not as convenient as a plantronics over the ear piece that they replaced. I have tried adding aftermarket over the ear hooks with no change in their ability to stay put. I have just purchased some aftermarket foam tips in the hope that they may hold the pods in place better.\", 'I\\'m honestly surprised by the glowibg reviews for these things. TL;DR If convenience is easily your top priorty, these are pretty darn convenient. If not, you should pass for the cost. Sound quality: 2/5 Voice quality: 2/5 Noise cancelling: 3/5 Convenience: 5/5 Controls: 2/5 Battery: 5/5 I like stuff that sounds good. These don\\'t really. I\\'m comparing these to Sony 1000XM3, Bose NC700, and Bose QC20.  None are a direct competitor given the bluetooth portability niche that these fill, but to be certain, that\\'s the entirety of what you pay for because those others clobber the airpods in every other respect for a similar price. Pros It pairs faster than any bluetooth device I\\'ve ever used. Pretty nice. They\\'re very light and fit well with optional ear fittings The case is a portable battery, slick Does wireless charging The design and \"buttonless\" buttons are pretty cool Cons The noise cancelling is decent, not stellar. Voice quality is mediocre. The controls are novel, but far leas than intuitive and I\\'m still not sure you can change the volume as you can with the others and would seem important on something designed to be wireless. Mostly the sound quality is very sub par, on the order of $20 earbuds from Target.', 'Wow! I was on the fence about getting these pros for quite a bit. I figured $50 wireless earphones could do the same things as these. The noise cancellation aspect of these are amazing & ultimately my reason for buying them because I work in a very loud warehouse. It\\'s so weird when you pop them in your ear, you can quite literally hear & somehow feel in your head stuff going silent around you with noise cancellation mode on! When transparency mode is on, it seems as though that\\'s how those cheap $50 wireless earphones would be. Simply feeling the buds in your ear but still being able to hear stuff around you.  I\\'m 23 and normally new tech does not really phase me too much. But when I tell you I feel like a person who is dumbstruck with a purchase of their first phone that\\'s able to take pictures, I\\'m not exaggerating! I feel like a child with a new toy lol. I can\\'t stop popping them in and out of my ear. I find it so cool that the noise cancellation is able to literally silence MOST things even when nothing is playing!! On another note, I had the 1st or 2nd gen of apple airpods and didn\\'t really care for them. It was cool that you can tap them to pause a song, etc, but thats all I got out of it. They didn\\'t fit my ears too well, you can hear stuff around you & often times made my ears hurt after using them for 30 mins+. These jelly ones stay put in my ear and do not hurt! But to sum it up, I would 10/10 pay $230 again for these. It\\'s a reason they\\'re this pricey. One fourth of the the price is of course because they\\'re \"Apple\" aka \"name brand\", but overall, its the tech that is used to make them work as they do!! I\\'m beyond impressed! If you\\'re on the fence as I was about these, take the lunge and get them!', 'Despite claims that it connects automatically to iPhone, I have to reconnect via Bluetooth settings every time I use them. I have done a reset and have the same issue. It connects extremely quickly to my 2019 MacBook Pro, but struggles with my brand new iPhone 13 pro. These were synced with iPhone prior to being synced to MacBook. They will literally sync to and play music from my sleeping and closed MacBook instead of connecting to my in use iPhone. When I do get them connected, they disconnect from iPhone about every 15 minutes, no issues with MacBook. Beyond that, sound quality is incredible. Noise cancelling is scary effective for in ear buds. Transparency mode leaves a bit lacking, I still feel the need to only use one ear bud in order to be aware of my surroundings. The button I will accidentally press when taking them in or out but is easy to function once in your ear. Fit is good but I enjoy silicon in ear headphones.  I use the medium size tips. There is a setting that will test the seal so you can know if they fit your ears well or not. They do not come with a charging block, only a cable, so make sure you have a way to charge them. They worked fine with my wireless chargers even when I added a silicon case.', \"Bought these for two reasons - 1. easy pairing with Apple ecosystem 2. primary use case hands free phone calls Got them and was impressed with sound quality and ease of pairing with iPhone and MacBook Air. Found when I made calls, that people said I sounded far away and muffled. Turns out the microphone doesn't work.  Also turns out, this is a known problem with the AirPod Pro. Tried all the solutions recommended in Apple community forums, YouTube, etc. to no avail. I was pairing with an iPhone 12 ProMax on iOs version 14.6 As stated, my primary use case was for handsfree phone calls. The microphone was junk and I returned it. Very frustrating, because it will take two weeks for Amazon to ship the replacement, and I would never expect Apple to ship a faulty product.\", \"I bought the Airpods Pro with two things in mind: first, as hearing protection when riding. Second, for noise cancellation during flights. Until now, I've been using the Bose QC20 for both, so I can compare them. When riding, I listen sometimes listen to music, but not always. One of the major drawbacks of the Bose are the wires. They tend to pull the earbuds out of my ear when looking left or right for traffic, and they move around. The Airpods Pro obviously have no wires, so they don't move around or pull. My concern was that they might fall out, but they fit snug in my ears underneath my helmet. Apple included a small test to see if they fit is correct, and they provide larger and smaller sizes. Sound quality is awesome on the Airpods Pro, very comparable to the Bose. The volume seems higher, but that could also be due to the better fit in my ears. The noise cancelling is slightly less, about 85% of the Bose. This is mostly noticable when idling, it seems that lower frequency tones are not canceled out as well as the Bose does. That said, it's still perfectly fine for riding, especially when listening to music. I have a flight scheduled by the end of this month, and will update my review with an in-flight experience.\", 'DO NOT buy these from amazon. hate to say it but go to best buy or get them through apple/.com and pay the full price. the airpods sold on here aren’t apple approved or even sold by the official apple store. read the other reviews people have been getting fakes that have real serial numbers that make it almost indistinguishable from the real ones and used pairs. you never know what you’ll be getting unless it’s sold by the official company.', 'While I’m not an audiophile, I have long been on the hunt for the perfect pair of true wireless earbuds.  I started out with Jabra’s 65t and was pretty happy overall, but they were bulky in the ears and died within 2.5 hours.  As someone who wears an earbud most of the day, I needed a better option.  I went to Jabra Active 75t and had to do TWO warranty replacements in less than 6 months of ownership for the same issue (loss of sound in the right earbud)….add in the fact that each earbud didn’t work independently and I was done with Jabra.  I sold the second set they sent me and bought these.  I’m overall very happy with these.  I don’t often listen to music with them, so I can’t judge them on bass/treble quality, but for what I need them for, they work quite well.  They fit much better than the original AirPods (which did not fit in my ears at all and were never a consideration for purchase) and they feel pretty secure when in my right ear.  The left earbud tends to fall out frequently if my ear is sweaty.  While the total usage time is less than Jabra (5.5 hrs vs 7.5 hrs), it hasn’t been an issue because a) I can switch to the left earbud while the right charges and b)the re-charging in the case is FAST.  Much faster than both of my Jabra’s.  I did switch to Comply tips, but the tips that came with them were pretty adequate. I feel them less in my ears than I did with both Jabra’s, which made my ears suffer from fatigue after a couple hours.  I wish that there were more options for controls on the earbuds themselves—it was quite disappointing actually.  I expected better controls and more features for the price.  The only other problem I have with them is that my sound stops randomly.  It’s actually pretty annoying and the sole reason that I went with 4 stars over 5.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason for the stopping—it happens at different times and in different apps—sometimes when I get a notification for something, sometimes not—but it always happens.  I have an iPhone 11 Pro, so I expected that they should sync perfectly.  Other than that, they are a much better true wireless set than Jabra….hands down.', \"Here are my gripes: The mic isn't long enough so it picks up everything around you but your voice. It is terrible quality for such an expensive product. My clients cant hear me at all while I'm sitting inside my house with no one home. Don't use them if you actually work out. They constantly fall out of my ears. I find myself adjusting them in my ear so they don't fall out. Only pro is the sound quality is much better than the regular Airpods. I wish I could get my money back for these. Go buy a pair of the regular Airpods, they fit my ear better and people can actually hear me.\", 'These have phenomenal functionality with my iPhone and MacBook. They sound great and are so easy to use. BUT...the hard plastic of the \"shell\" just does not fit my ear, with any eartip. My ears become so sore and just never get used to the hard, ill-shaped plastic. I\\'ve struggled with every other Apple headphone for this reason. I\\'m female and have fairly average sized/shaped ears. For as great as they are in every other respect, I\\'m a multi-hour-a-day-user and this is a dealbreaker. I will be sending them back. I\\'m writing this review less to warn others away—if they fit your ears, you\\'ll love them; there\\'s a reason they\\'re sold out—and more to get Apple\\'s attention. Please consider a soft or differently shaped bud as I\\'m not the only one suffering! It is the plastic part, not the silicone, which presses too hard against my concha (look it up.) I was so excited to get these and loved the functionality, simplicity and sound. I\\'m heartbroken to have to send them back and really hoping Apple responds with smaller buds as the technology gets better. For an alternative for those who also feel this pain, the ComfoBuds Pro are pretty great. The noise cancelling is actually a little better (!), they take hours to hurt instead of minutes, and they actually have a clearer-sounding microphone compared to the Air Pods Pros. The downsides are the sound quality is a notch lower (a bit hissy), and the venting in the ears isn\\'t as nuanced, so I felt a bit \"plugged\" at first and had a hard time hearing myself talk (but got used to it). And of course, it\\'s not going to intuitively switch between devices, so it\\'s a bit clunkier getting set up every time you pop them in. But, I\\'m hoping they\\'ll get me through to when Apple can offer a product I can actually wear.', 'When they work they are amazing. The problem is that they don’t consistently connect to my iPhone. This is really annoying when you are trying to take an important call and the airpods just wont connect. The worse is when i have to tell the caller to wait because my apple airpods aren’t connecting, to give me a sec while i take them off and put the caller on speakerphone.. no biggie right? Well, many times after placing both airpods  on a surface so i can get to my call, they decide to connect to my iPhone.  Now the embarrassing process starts again, you have to ask the caller to hold on because the airpods finally connected and you cant hear them because now they airpods are on the counter.  I’m extremely technical. I’ve turned my house into a smarthome. Everything including shades.  I can program in multiple languages.  The point is that I’m technical and know how to troubleshoot things in my own.  The only way to temporarily fix this problem consistently is by unpairing the airpods from your iPhone and re-pairing them again. It always works.. for some days or couple of weeks.  After experiencing the same issue with 2 sets of airpods (2nd gen and latest pro), i decided to get the sony wf-1000xm4, they are absolutely amazing and connect flawlessly every single time. Done with apple airpods for good', 'I bought these by mistake and was going to return them, but my Jabra 75Ts crapped out on me so I retrieved the box of AirPods heading back for return and gave them a go. First, I\\'m not a big Apple person, but my kids were forced into the Apple ecosystem at their schools (genius move, Apple), which means I am now in the Apple ecosystem as well (iPhone). I had been using the Jabras for 6+ months. First, the Pros don\\'t fit snug into my ears. I feel like there should be a larger size tip available. I can get them to fit if I really work at it and get them *just right* but it\\'s not easy. Second (probably related to the first), the noise canceling is a joke. My Jabras give me dead silence when NC is turned on. The Pros I would say have \"noise reduction\" at best, but definitely not canceling. Third, the sound quality of the Pros is no match for the Jabras. I need to EQ the sh*t out of everything to get decent sound. Finally, and the biggest issue for me, is that there is no volume control on the Pros themselves. You have to use your phone, or say \"hey siri, increase volume\" which is just stupid. However, that said, the reason I\\'m out on the Jabras is my 2nd pair in 6 months broke (replacements for the first pair that broke). Their warranty process is a PITA so I won\\'t be going back to them. I\\'ll probably throw the Jabras in the garbage, return the AirPods, and try to find something that actually sounds good and works more than a few months.', \"I purchased the Airpod Pro in December of 2020.  Immediately I discovered that the ear coverings slip out of my ear quite easily.  It is the material that Apple uses rather than the sizing.  I purchased ear coverings made from a different material and these have worked fine.  As I spent over $200 for these Air Pod Pros, I would expect that they have a better solution for the ear coverings.  Now after four months of use, the plastic piece that connects the speaker to the ear covering, has cracked and fallen off.  The battery life drops off significantly when the Noise cancellation feature  is turned on.  Apple has crafted nice features to work with an Iphone.  If you don't have an Iphone, choose another less expensive brand for your earbuds.  If you have an Iphone, consider getting the less expensive 2nd generation Airpods rather than the Airpod Pros. UPDATE:  I am trying to determine if Apple will replace or fix the broken plastic piece under warranty.  I made an appointment and went to Best Buy, an Apple Authorized dealer, for assistance.  The Best Buy clerk told me that if I didn't purchase  my Airpods there, or did not have Apple Care, then they couldn't help me. I called the local Apple store number, but was routed to some guy that couldn't help me, so he routed me to Apple Care.  The Apple care person decided that sending the unit in to Apple was not an option.  She wasn't sure if my Airpods break would be covered under limited warranty, so we decided to find an appointment for my local Apple store.  This store is an 1 and 1/2 hour roundtrip driving commitment, which I am willing to do, if necessary.  She could only look seven days in advance and there were no available appointments within a 100 mile radius. At this point, I asked her what should I do?  She said I could go to the Apple store without an appointment and take my chances.  I fail to see how an Apple store employee should be a able to make a warranty decision that the Apple home office cannot.  So I am stuck wondering whether I should commit to the 1 and 1/2 hour drive  to the Apple store, or take my chances with Super glue on my over-priced, underwhelming Airpod Pro.\", 'I\\'ve been using Apple products since the 80s. The AirPods Pro do not represent Apple well. The battery case has been replaced twice, due to lockups and lack of charging. The AirPods Pro do not seamlessly connect to the iPhone 12, often resulting in the famous \"can you hear me now?\" statements on both sides of the conversation. Apple touts a specific chip to make this all happen, well it doesn\\'t. Apple\\'s answer every time is to \\'forget\\' the device on the iPhone 12 then re-pair it. Seriously? Then there\\'s the hit or miss switching from the iPhone 12 to the 16\" MacBook Pro. Again, often does not work, especially the microphone. It has gotten so bad that I just use the 5K monitor speakers/microphone. I suspect the great ratings are due to the vast majority of folks listening to music, podcasts, etc., the majority of the time. If you\\'re a business user and NEED flawless connections to phone calls, look elsewhere.', 'Overall these are very good. But that’s not what I paid $250 for. I seriously considered returning them; the deciding factor is how easily they pair with my iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. Even my Surface laptop. My three issues: 1-assembly. I had to take 600 and 1,000 grain sand paper to remove a sharp edge where the two parts of the shell join. On both pods. 2-fit. Regular apple ear buds never fall out for me, but these fall out 3-5 times/week with the silicone stock buds. So I spent another $30 on aftermarket foam. GET APPLECARE for these. 3-noise cancellation. Mediocre. For the trade off in sound quality, I almost always use normal instead. I’m tempted to drop it more, but they’re very good overall. It’s a weird review to write.', 'I wasn\\'t sure I would like the AirPods Pro.  It\\'s been awhile since I had a pair of \"in-ear\" earbuds and I was perfectly content with my first generation Airpods.  But I\\'m easily lured by shiny new technology and had to try them out.  Here are a few thoughts: 1. They\\'re comfortable.  There are multiple size ear tips that can be used to customize the fit. The ear tips are a soft material that sit easily and comfortably inside the ear. 2. The noise cancellation is pretty impressive.  I have Bose QC25s and Beats Studio 3s and the Airpod Pros make a good showing up against the two sets of noise cancelling headphones. (I know neither are rated the best as noise cancelling headphones but just comparing to what I have.) 3. The case is just a touch larger than the original Airpod cases but just so.  Still pocketable and still tiny. 4. Battery life is excellent; I haven\\'t charged them more than once in the last month with using them once every few nights for an hour or so. I\\'ve heard some people using both the first or second gen. Airpods as well as the Pros; I\\'ve been doing just that the last month.  When I want to tune out everything around me, I use the Pros. And when I need to hear what\\'s going on around me, and I\\'m not so fully immersed in what I\\'m listening to, I use my first gen. Airpods.  (The pros have a \"transparent mode\" that allows the listener to hear things going on around them; it works! But I still try to get some use out of my first gen. here and there.) It\\'s impressive tech, and I can\\'t wait to see what the next few generations of the Pros have to offer.', \"Sound quality is good if you can get them to securely fasten well in your ears. Noise cancellation is actually pretty cool, works well. Battery Life good, but seems pretty much the same as older version. I have tried to get these to stay in my ear securely since I got them, tried all the different versions of the rubber inserts, but alas they are simply ok and I've had them fall out numerous times and even while just sitting and watching a video. I eventually moved my old ones out of storage and would switch them out once the battery ran down on these, so a pretty close comparison side by side. To be honest I think I like the old ones better. YMMV\", 'Though the sound quality is excellent, I am giving them one star because they just will not stay in your ears. The sound quality is perfect! The noise cancellation is also superb! Battery life also very good. BUT- I actually can’t stand the rubber ear pieces (I’m positive they have a proper name, I just don’t know it lol). I have tried all three sizes of the changeable rubber ear pieces, none of them stay in firmly. It ruins your listening experience when you have to constantly keep pushing in the pods as they slip out. NOT worth the price. Also, I hate that while I am adjusting the falling out pods that you hang up o a call or pause a song, all unintended. I wish I would have just stayed with the original pods. They need to MAJORLY improve these! I would NOT buy again.', 'I\\'m sure most of the 5-star reviews are from enthusiastic people that just got them in the mail. Super easy to use, they look great, the noise cancelling, sound quality and microphones are good (nothing to justify the price but not bad). At $150, these would be good headphones. But! There is a serious defect in these things now, which is probably why they\\'re always so discounted... After 6 months or so of owning them (I use them daily for work), a crackling sound started in the right AirPod. It got worse and worse until it was a constant buzzing when I moved or talked. I looked around online and there is an official Apple support page just for this issue - the issue stems from the noise cancelling pickup mic on the outside of the AirPod. Apple was kind enough to just send a replacement to me, which arrived a couple of days later. All good. It\\'s been 3-4 months since then and the problem started again in the replacement. I contacted Apple support, again, and did the same \"diagnostic\" steps, again. This time, instead of replacing it, they offered to send me a box so I could send my AirPods back to them for \"repair.\" No thanks, Apple. I\\'ll just cut my losses and spend money elsewhere. If you haven\\'t made the purchase yet, don\\'t. Wait until Apple releases the next version (hopefully fixing the issue) or better yet, spend your hard-earned bills on better headphones (there are plenty better sounding options) that won\\'t require substantial time-investment just to keep them running. These aren\\'t worth the money or the hassle.', 'This is a fantastic addition to your Apple ecosystem. I’m amazed at the tech/features they put into these little things! First off, the sound quality is amazing for being tiny earbuds! Deep, rich tones and superb clarity are what these earbuds are all about. Next up, the noise-cancellation system is sweet! They utilize microphones to digitally cancel out noise or, via Transparency mode, allow environmental sounds to pass through to you. A very cool feature but one that results in the loss of a star in battery life. Battery life isn’t bad at all if you don’t use the NC/Transparency. Using those cuts listening time down a few hours. But I can usually get a solid 5-6 straight hours out of a single charge. I will also state that the charge case can get 3-4 complete charges out of it before it has to be plugged in (or sat on your wireless charger). Some other highlights of these is the integration of Siri capabilities. She can obviously announce callers and phone numbers but can also read texts to you through them and have you respond without ever having to look at your phone! Another cool feature is the ability to support surround sound. It creates a very immersive experience when watching movies or gaming. There are so many things that I’m still learning about these earbuds. One tiny drawback is that even when using the smallest cushion (there are 3 sizes in the box), they don’t like to stay in. I guess I have smaller ear holes! And after a few days, my ears are raw from the oblong openings that face the inside of the ear. I wish those we shallower or rounded off. I’d try to alter the myself but I don’t want to accidentally mess up the screens or something. Overall I love these little earbuds and am glad I bought them.', \"Apple earphones have never fit my ears well enough that I was comfortable using them for anything more than sitting at my desk working.  I've always purchased some sort of over the ear retaining device to help keep them in place.  When I saw the shape of the airpods pro, I thought they had fixed my problem.  Initially they felt great and seemed to stay in, but as I've used them more, the left airpod will not stay put, and I'm constantly trying to reposition it in my ear.  I've tried all of the sizes for the tips and still the left one doesn't quite fit well enough.  It will fall out if I'm moving around a bunch, like during yard work.  So next I purchased the tips with the memory foam under the silicon, but those don't help either.  Ultimately I went with a rubber sleeve that braces the airpod inside your ear, and those have helped a little, you just can't charge with them on.  I think the shape of the main part of the airpods, and my ear, just doesn't allow the noise isolating tips far enough down inside my ear canal.  And for the fitment issues, I am a little bummed I spent this kind of money. I'm no audiophile, and I can't say I've ever had high end earbuds or earphones, but the sound is impressive to me.  I really like the pass through function so I can hear people talking and just ambient sounds around me. I have had no complaints when talking to people with the microphone.  So I'd give the sound quality and functions two thumbs up.  Fit issues are going to bug me for as long as I own these.  I don't typically buy tech products for short term, so I committed to these until they die.  I would recommend them, but definitely wait for a sale.\", \"These are so bad.  If you lean forward to pick something up off floor or look in your bottom desk drawer, the pods fall out of your ear.  When you try to stop push them back in your ear before falling  out (which is often ),  you end up hanging up on your call.  As a realtor, this is very frustrating.  I've tried positioning the pods several ways and if I turn my head too far to either side, they are dislodged and start to fall.  Another horrible problem is the short battery life, only a couple of hours.  I missed my return date by one day, so I'm just stuck with them.  I tried to offer them to my granddaughter whose 12 and she said no (she said her mom has them and she didn't like them either).\", 'All I can say is, so far, these things are AMAZING!! I’ve gone through enough of the cheap Bluetooth earbuds, that I was hesitant to buy these.. first and foremost, they’re not cheap.. but I probably would have saved hundreds if I’d just gotten these to begin with. They are super comfortable. Convenient. My phone doesn’t need to be on me , in fact I can be far enough away and it doesn’t effect it in any way. The sound quality is amazing. Both  sides. I tested all sorts of things with my sister on the phone.. washing dishes, sweeping, starting the washer and dryer, even vacuuming. And she was actually really impressed !  While she obviously couldn’t hear me as clearly as if there was no background noise, it wasn’t bothersome in the least; she could still here me just fine. That said , I have yet to use it for anything else besides that one call... be it music, or noise cancellation... YET. But I have no doubt it will not only NOT disappoint, I know it will supersede my expectations. The ONLY thing that threw me off, and maybe it’s because I’m getting old (and it does NOT change my opinion of these, but had I known I would have gotten one at the same time), but  I had no idea you’d need to charge the case/earbuds wirelessly..  with one of those wireless charging pads . Ha! So that’s my only piece of advice for those who aren’t as up to date with that stuff.... get a universal/compatible wireless charging pad :) Final thought ... QUALITY over quantity!! Highly recommend, and in my opinion, well worth every penny. Incredibly happy with them!', 'I rarely write reviews, but I’m so happy with this purchase I had to make sure I did. I am a pretty big skeptic and saw all the reviews that said they were fake. I almost didn’t buy them because of that. Boy that would’ve been a mistake! In June we bought some cheapo Bluetooth wireless for like $40. We aren’t real big spenders if we don’t have to be. Well, after a month the right ear stopped working. So I went back to read the reviews and write one. Surprise! They aren’t listed on here anymore. Next I found a pair of Sennheiser on Crutchfield on sale. Some of the reviews mentioned they weren’t that comfortable and the sound was not as loud as they would like. I ignored the reviews, as this seems to be a well respected brand on their site with other headphone products. You had to twist them into your ear to make the right fit. I tried all the inserts they provided. Just not happy. Crutchfield has an amazing 60 return policy, so I returned them. Since I have a iPhone 13 Pro, decided to bite the bullet and get AirPods. I was figuring on regular ones with a wired charger. Low and behold these are on sale!!! Got them for $180. With the discomfort of the previous ones, I was honestly really hesitant to get these because they have the insert on the end. I love the feel of the normal wired ones, but wanted the superior sound. So I gave them a try. Typical Apple product they paired right up with my phone! That is the one thing I love about Apple/iPhone, such an easy consumer experience. LOVE them! They stay in my ear super well. Sound is AMAZING! Battery life to me is great. I sit at a desk and work at home all day. I love listening to music so I use them all day. If I have a meeting or something, I just throw them in the case to charge and that helps me get through the day. I think once I had to take them out to charge and I just threw my wired ones on for a short while. The sound quality on calls is also awesome! I’ve asked and people said they can’t even tell that they are headphones. The one thing I hated about the Sennheiser is I had to adjust the ear piece a lot, cause it would feel like it would fall out and the touch control would be activated. So songs would pause, skip, ect. Annoying! On these you pinch the stem, so I can adjust if necessary for fit/comfort without issue. I haven’t used the voice activation much or noise cancelling. My wife also works from home, so I don’t want to have that on and want to be able to hear if she says something from another room. One thing I was not expecting that made me die laughing when it happened. I got a text and it read the persons name, their text and the emoji they sent. Something like: ‘Text from Fred Flintstone, did you see the play in the game, exclamation point, laughing emoji, crying emoji’. After the text it asks if you want to reply. I was outside doing work when this first happened, so I did reply using voice activation. You can turn it off, but found it hilarious. If I’m really nit picking, the only thing is that they pair to your phone and they ‘belong’ to you. We went on a camping trip and my wife likes to run and I was worried that she wouldn’t be able to pair/use them with her iPhone. It works, not a problem, I forget if it was much hassle, but overall that is the only thing I can remotely complain about. Since it worked I have zero issue with it. I’d buy these again in a heart beat. Anyone that has an iPhone and is in the market it’s a no brained!', '', 'Having been an Android user forever, I finally made the leap to the Apple world, and purchased an iPhone 12 max pro 2 months ago. For the most part, I regretted the purchase, and felt I should’ve went with the Note 21, which I’d been eyeing for some time. After getting more familiar with the iPhone, I still longed for my Android. However, after purchasing the AirPods, I’m definitely sticking with Apple products. What an awesome product!!! I’ve never been without bluetooth headphones, mainly those that go over the back of your neck and extend and retract on each side. When mowing the grass, using the leaf blower, or anything else very loud, I had to max the volume and sometimes still couldn’t hear the music or podcast. And every bluetooth headset supposedly had noise reduction, and they did to a certain extent. But the Airpods are a completely different experience. As long as I have them both in, I can set the volume on medium and still hear the music, as the outside noises are truly reduced! Also, with the previous devices, which I had to replace on average every 6 months, people would always say they couldn’t hear me, or i sound muffled. With the AirPods, I’ve asked many people, and they say the sound is great. The only thing I miss about the bluetooth neck headset is not having to have something in my ear(s) all the time, when I wasn’t listening to something or on a call. But the other benefits far outweigh that inconvenience.  That said, I have to admit the AirPods have made me an Android convert!', \"I love headphones and noise cancellation. I must have dozens of various designs and brands. I also love my AirPods 1. The AirPods Pro take a lot of time to get the right fit and the fit is paramount to these working for you. They can sound powerful or weak, depending on how they fit. They can also hurt like heck in the ear after even a fit minutes if the fit is too tight. Ironically, I liked the way that the originals fit - not too tight and not too loose. I now sometimes reach for the originals when noise cancellation is not that important. Note also that there is a very 'negative pressure' sound to these, similar to the earlier Bose QuietComforts. The sound from the Pros is better when they work, no doubt. Finally, I do not like the way Apple has made the interactions with the Pros. I do not like having to press the pod stem to forward, reverse, start, etc the song. I liked the originals with the tapping of the pod. Pressing always moves the pod a bit, why not keep the tapping instead - it was much easier.\", 'I really think that the Apple Pro AirPods are a good thing to have since unlike my Beats Headphones Solo3 these can take some sweat during hot weather.  When I bought my Beats headphone I was living in NY but since then have moved to FL.  Being here made me appreciate the usefulness of having sweat resistant ear pods.  I have to say outright that I never really liked the wired headphones that used to come with a iPhone because it always seemed so much like being on a leash to my phone.  I love listening not only to music but now also I have come to be listening to Audible so these really came in handy for that.  The best I can say is I am still in the mindset that these can fall out of my ears without any notice.  When I purchased them I bought a few things for them that will keep them in my possession rather than take a chance that they wouldn’t fall out.  After losing one of my hearing aids it was foremost the most important thing because I never thought that I would lose that and I am sure that’s why I bought 2 extra accessories for them so I would feel better about using them.  The sound from the AirPods is a very good aspect and I am glad I bought them.  I also have to say that I think that anyone in need of buying a really great gift shouldn’t hesitate about getting these because overall they are really great.  If anything else comes to pass I will write an update.', 'These are worth every dollar I paid. I probably spent as much on cheapo versions that never came close to working as well. I’ve probably purchased ten sets of wireless ear buds over the past two years, hoping they would be good enough, yet none ever were. I stepped up and bought the AirPods when the revised “in-ear” version came out, and I couldn’t be happier. They fit great (first version never stayed in based on my experience with the shape of the original “wired” versions). These are comfortable and I can use them for long periods without discomfort. I love the thoughtful touches — the ease of pairing, the noise cancellation which works surprisingly well, the fit, the buttons. I love when I take one AirPod out, my music or Podcast automatically pauses so I can chat with someone, and the music/Podcast starts back up when I put it back in.  Or, I can click the button to pause, and hold to turn off noise cancellation and allow amplified sound to pass thru using Transparency Mode so I can hear sounds around me easier. I can see runners/bikers turning on the transparency mode so they can better hear cars and other vehicles near them. I also really like that I can easily use these with any Apple device logged in to my account. If I want to watch TV quietly, I quickly sync up with my Apple TV and I can watch/listen without disturbing anyone else. But when I want to use them again with my phone, there’s no clumsy un-pairing process and I don’t have to re-pair with my phone. It works nice and seamlessly. These are well-designed and work great. Love them.', \"The sound is great, and I love the noise canceling feature! The drawbacks for me far outweigh the benefits, however. If I bump them while in a zoom meeting, the meeting automatically ends for me. There are seemingly settings in my phone I can adjust according to Google, but those aren't in my phone when I go to those specific settings. *Shrugs* The sound cuts in and out during meetings. You'd think that would be an indicator of a weak Wifi setting, but I've tested with other (non apple) earbuds and have not had any issues. I absolutely hate that there's no volume control on these. When I drop the case, which happens more than I'd like to admit, without fail, the case opens and the earbuds go flying. I would go back to my standard airpods, but they decided they didn't want to function anymore (I promise it's not because I dropped them one to many times). After almost $400 spent in rather mediocre Apple airpods, I personally feel there's better brands out there, which is hard to say coming from someone who ONLY has Apple products.\", 'I, now understand why the heck these are so expensive.  These are such great wireless earbuds and exceed my expectations. Pros: 1) connecting to your iPhone never get easier than this AirPods.  just open the case and pull the earphone out and voila~!  the pic of the AirPods is on your iPhone screen. 2) I love the picture battery display, open the case and put next to your phone and battery status both case and AirPods pop up on your iPhone. 3) These buds fit my ears so well (love that they provide s few different sizes).  my wife has small ears and usually, all headphone is just too big for her but these AirPods are perfect for her and me. 4) noise cancellation mode & transparency mode: The noise cancellation on these AirPods is unbelievably good.  filter out all those backgrounds noise so you can concentrate on your phone conversation/movie/news. The transparent mode is something new to me.  In this mode, even the AirPods are nicely sealed around my ears I can still hear all my surroundings and have a normal conversation with my AirPods on. Sometimes I am scared that I am talking too loud on a phone conversation so I turn on this transparent mode where I can hear my own voice.  and if the background noise is too loud I just turn on the noise cancellation mode.  you can turn this function on and off based on your own preference. 5) Sound and quality are solid as well and the Bluetooth connection works great. Great sound quality.  Although I need to adjust my volume over 50% most of the time. 6)The battery life on these are great as well. Nothing is more annoying when watching a movie and having your battery die during your commute.  when you don\\'t just pop it back to the case and you have fully charge AirPods every time you want to use it. 7) You can locate these Airpods through the \"Find my iPhone\" app and play a sound on it if you can find it. The price is not cheap.  but you get what you pay for.  Overall it is excellent headphones at a higher price, but worth it if you are using iPhone.', 'All in all when it comes down to it Apple just makes quality products! Expensive...but quality! I love them I never found the air pods to be comfortable and they would always fall out of my ear... So I have been very hesitant to buy these. However the splurge was worth it the sound quality is great and the noise canceling feature is so nice. The only annoying thing is Apple really knows how to price gouge you. I checked and checked the box for the charging bod only to find there wasn’t one. And it wasn’t just me...they did this on purpose! The fact that they don’t include the charging box with the cable is flat out annoying. With the amount of money you pay for the headphones that can’t be costing them that much to include it. Their price margin is still so I am sure. But instead now and buying a box for more money playing their game. They have quite the marketing!', \"Hands down, the most impressive feature to me is the noise cancellation. I've got four kids, and when I first got these I'd gotten my three toddlers down for a nap then turned on the noise cancellation while I sat in my home office, and it was just so relaxing. There are noises around you that you don't even realize, and I really felt like I'd just been wrapped in some warm comforting cloud, just turning on the noice cancellation and nothing else. Outside of that, the sound is great and I love how seamlessly they work with my phone. You can open up the charging case and the phone will show you how much battery is left on the case and the pods themselves. I came to find out with these that you don't have to jam them up your ear canal to get them to stay in. I have them resting pretty comfortably in there. I haven't exercised with them, but I do go on regular dog walks and have done my yard work with them in and had no trouble with them staying in. The only time I can remember them falling out was when I was holding one of my kids and they were being all squirmy. Anyway, I highly recommend the AirPod Pros. Stick them in your ear and relax.\", \"I would absolutely give these Airpod Pros 5 stars if they included the USB C charging block with them,  the noise cancellation feature actually cancelled out low frequency sound waves and they included a volume control ON the actual earbuds.  I'm kind of annoyed that I had to go and purchase a seperate $20 USB C charging block to plug the charging cable into.  These airpods do charge wirelessly in the case but you will eventually need to recharge the case up which is why they include a chaging cord but it is USB C to take note of that.  There is also no volume control on the earbuds. You need to go to your phone which can be inconvenient if jogging or working out with them. They also do not cancel low frequency sound from neighbor's audio equipment but then nothing so far has.  Overall the sound quality is amazing and I love the noise cancellation feature while listening to music at the gym.  It totally turns off all surrounding noise for machines, weights being dropped, etc... I do love them but they could be improved.\", 'Don’t get me wrong, these are excellent overall... however, the biggest thing I cannot get over is the battery life. It is terrible. Call me spoiled, but having the Galaxy Buds+ with 11hrs of playtime meant I could wear them all day at work, and at home doing chores with minimal charging of the buds. Even using the Jabra Elite 75T with 8hrs battery life was still enough to not have me worry (I couldn’t get used to the master Right bud connection) Airpods pro, on the other hand, deliver 5 hrs if your lucky. Use ANC or transparency its north of 4 hrs! 4 hrs means I’m constantly worrying about battery life. I just finished listening to a few debates on YouTube and my Earbud was at 16% The features on these buds, however, are truly well executed. ANC is about 75% as effective as my Bose QC2 headphones, which is much better than I ever expected. Apple was also smart enough to utilize the inside microphones resulting in an unbelievably natural sounding ‘transparency mode’ My beef with these buds are, as great as these features are, what good is it with a dead battery? 4 hours is probably enough for the general public, and for those looking for a earbud with above average sound quality and top tier ANC and ambient awareness. But for me, who wants these features and with better battery life: it has me eagerly anticipating the Bose Quiet Comfort TWS earbuds coming later this month', 'I\\'m not a fan of earbuds that are \"in-ear.\" You know, the ones with the rubber tips that you stuff into your ear canals. They normally make me feel uneasy and cause me headaches. As a result, I\\'ve decided to stick with the classic EarPods and AirPods style. It wasn\\'t easy to make the decision to buy AirPods Pro. It goes against all of my earphone convictions and expectations. Apple, on the other hand, deserves praise because this is now my primary listening system (previously an AirPods 2nd gen user). Because of the build-up of pressure in the ear canal, I discovered that in-ear style buds cause me discomfort. The AirPods Pro have vents that control the pressure inside your ear, making them feel almost as inconspicuous as the normal AirPods. I can wear these for hours until the battery runs out, while the standard AirPods hurt after around an hour. By keeping the AirPods stem, you can easily switch between transparency and noise cancellation modes. I normally keep mine on Transparency mode, but switching to noise cancellation mode when my surroundings are too noisy is cool. FYI, the AirPods Pro come with a range of ear tips, so you\\'ll most likely find one that suits your ear canal perfectly. I bought this on sale for under $300 CAD at the time of writing this article. Another factor this is a good buy is Apple\\'s ability to make their goods work so well together. If you have an iPhone/iPad, AppleTV, or MacBook, you can easily move between devices without having to re-pair the AirPods. That is to say, my wife has successfully used this for her Windows laptop. Overall, I am glad I took the chance on these. Hoping to use this for many years to come.', 'My AirPods were not sealing in the ear properly. No matter how much money you will save do not purchase Apple products if not in the Apple Store. Amazon tech support was polite, however, will send u to deal w Apple, they will even connect you. Apple will claim you will need to deal with Amazon, so after the back and forth, Apple will make you wait for parts and treat u differently because u purchase them not through Apple. A Nightmare for me. It took me 4 visits to the Apple Store, hours on the phone, and almost $75 of Transportation. After getting off the phone w Apple, who instructed me to go to the store and just swap the device that they had it in stock, I headed to the store right away: First visit: They ordered new AirPods (only the AirPods parts without the case), I had to go back to pick them up after a few days. \\u2028Second visit: Picked them up. Apple employee told me to go home and plug it in that it would work after 30 min. I did. No luck. Waited for a few hours plugged in, still no luck. Called Apple Support who told me the problem was in the case and sent me back to the store. Third visit: Went back to the Apple store and genius found out the AirPods had different Firmware from each other. Told me it would take awhile for the AirPods to look at each other and update themselves. Also they got me a new case (luckily in stock). The agent told me I had to wait 30 minutes plugged in there that it would work with the new case. It didn’t. However, they would not go any further with me unless I waited longer plugged in which I couldn’t. They sent me home and said it would work in a few hours. Of course it didn’t. Left it plugged in overnight, no luck in the morning. Fourth visit: Back to the store in the morning. I was at this point beyond frustrated and since the very beginning, I asked them to simply swap the defective product w new AirPods since mine were less than a month old. They said they would not. At this moment, finally someone bright, one of the managers, noticed the situation and saw there was nothing they could do about it, Since all parts were already swapped and decided to do the obvious thing and give me a new product. This was the worse experience I have ever had. I can try to prove to you that up to this day, I might have given Apple somewhere in the vicinity of almost 100k thinking better. My weekend was completely ruined for a mere $250 retail and probably $50 in parts for Apple. Thank you for that.', 'I\\'ll be comparing three different pairs of headphones, as any one of them would have top marks by themselves, and my review would be meaningless; With this price point they had better be decent headphones. The headphones I\\'ll be comparing are: Apple AirPods Pro (referred to as \"Air\" from here on), Sennheiser CX 400BT (referred to as \"CX\" from here on), and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 (referred to as \"MO\" from here on). Moving on. *Sound* All 3 sound great, but the MO was the clear winner, giving the most true-to-life sound, including all of the subtle highs and lows. The Air was a not-too-far-off second; it lacked some depth in the high notes. The CX wasn’t too far behind the Air; it had better sound, however, it had significant issues stemming from noise cancellation, see below. *Noise Cancellation* The Air definitely has the best noise cancellation, for me; it isn’t especially awesome, but it’s adequate for most situations. It’s probably about as good as you can expect in this price range, but cannot compare to over-ear headphones. The MO wasn’t too terribly far behind, and may even have better noise cancellation, but due to fitment issues, below, the seal wasn’t good enough to cancel out most of the noises around me. The CX has no noise cancellation. I didn’t realize how big of an issue this would be, but when I actually manage a decent seal on the ear buds, I can hear my own breathing (not a mouth-breather, by the way!) almost as loud as my music. This was the deal-killer for me. Otherwise the CX would be on par with the others, and at half the price. *Fitment* Both of the Sennheisers fit identically, and are a better fit, in that they actually stay in my ears. However, as stated above, the actual buds don’t fit my ears; I seem to be right between the small and medium buds. The Sennheisers kind of twist into your ear, and hold similar to a sport headphone, which is nice, but also a nuisance. The Air’s buds are a much better fit, but they don’t stay in my ears at all; The slightest movement and they fall out. I bought some “ear hooks” for them, and they stay in my ears perfectly, now. However, the ear hooks add just a hair of silicone to the exterior of the headphones, which caused me discomfort after a few hours (Note: this has nothing to do with the actual headphones). *Battery* I want to say the Sennheisers’ battery lasted way longer than the Airs (a full work day). That said, I did not pay attention to how long it took them to recharge in their case. The Airs seem to only last 6-8 hours (I should mention I have long work days, haha), but I watched their battery level for a couple minutes the first time I charged them, and they were charging about 1% per 10-15 seconds. Assuming it actually keeps that pace, that’s a full charge within 16-24 minutes, which seems pretty good to me. One charge drained the Air’s case by 20%, so you get 5 charges out of it. Unfortunately, I don’t recall most of this stuff with the Sennheisers. *Technology* I’d say that none of them stand out as being better here, just different. The Sennheisers might have a slight upper hand, as they have more controls available to them, but some of them make no sense to me, and there’s no way to reprogram them (as far as I can tell. It may be possible via their app, but I imagine this is specific to the device, and I want them to work the same on all devices. Also, both Sennheisers have issues with the fact that all controls are right on the face of the headphone, and it’s almost impossible to put them in your ears without touching the face. The Airs CAN’T CONTROL VOLUME! For real?! You have to control it from your phone/listening device. This absolutely drives me nuts (at least 20 times a day). The Airs actually has a button on the stem that you have to push for all of the controls. I was under the impression it felt seamless, similar to a touchscreen; Not the case. Lastly, based on their product description and reviews, it seemed that the Airs can only connect to Apple products, but based on their incredibly short manual, it would appear that it can indeed connect to any bluetooth device (unfortunately all I own are Apple products, so I can’t verify this). All 3 headphones pause your music when you take them out, which is nice. I sure wish I could turn them off (without putting them in their case), but none of them allow this. *Summary* For myself, I opted to return the Sennheisers, and plan to stick with the Air. The Sennheisers had more significant issues involving fit and noise cancellation, and the Air has more significant issues with the interface (no volume control), and don’t stay in your ears without outside assistance via ear hooks.', \"I was hesitant to buy the Apple AirPods Pro due to price, but the recent price drop was hard to resist. Indeed, they are worth the bucks: wonderful sound quality, comfy and easy to use. I can switch quickly between use on my iMac Pro and iPhone XR without a glitch. AirPods Pros know what I'm doing and just switch or sometimes ask if I want to use them on my iMac (e.g., your AirPods Pros are near by...). The noise reduction is amazing and better than anything I've used before, and I've owned many earphones with electronic NR. Sound quality was thin and muted out of the box but a few days play-in and the AirPods Pro were sounding full, realistic and beautiful. Sound quality is similar to the original AirPods but a level clearer due to the NR feature. They sound better than my Klipsch S10—similar priced older earbuds—and don't make strange wind whistle sounds while walking outside! The only issue, albeit I knew this before I bought them, is battery life is on the short side. It's normally not an issue in daily life but on a 6 hour flight to Vegas from Honolulu I had to put them in the charging case 2/3 of the way through the flight. They're not perfect but pretty close: wish I had bought the AirPods Pro sooner...\", 'I’ve never had an allergic reaction to any food or material in my life, but within a few hours of using these for the first time my ears became red and insanely itchy.  Over the next two weeks that was followed by crusty skin, intense pain, swollen ear canals and loss of many nights sleep. In Googling I found this problem is widespread with many people reporting the same issue.  When I called Apple to request at least a replacement of the silicone buds for foam, they said they were unaware of the problem, had no substitutes and wished to have their engineers speak with me.  And they wanted photos of my ears!  Again, other people have reported the same interaction with Apple reps raising the call through several layers of supervision but offering no explanation or assistance. It’s so disappointing that Apple is ignoring a major health/safety issue. Don’t buy these.', \"You aren't buying these for the sound quality, you're buying them for the integration into your apple devices. End of story. These are reasonably comfortable. Sound quality is acceptable, as is the noise cancelling. You aren't going to be able to compare these to a pair of Shure, Bose, or Sony noise cancelling headphones because there just isn't a comparison to make. All three of those manufacturers make far better sounding products. But you're not paying for sound quality or excellent noise cancelling from these earbuds, you're paying for the integration into your apple ecosystem. Teams call on your macbook? They pick night up. Facetime comes through on your iPad a few minutes after your teams call? Switches seamlessly to the ipad. Music playback from your iphone? You got it, seamless switching. That doesn't happen with devices from any other manufacturer that I've come across. So yes, these are a bit of a compromise in audio quality, but in terms of integration and convenience, 5/5 stars. If you know that when you're making your decision to buy, you'll undoubtedly be happy with the result.\", 'I really like the Airpod Pro! I do! The sounds and noise cancelling capability is extremely good for such a small device, almost the same level as my Sony WH-1000XM3’s. And they integrate so well into the iPhone and other Apple devices. My one big complaint is battery life. I get maybe 4 hours continuous listening, which is fine if I am just around the house taking phone calls or listening to some music. Where 4 hours doesn’t cut it is flying. This past weekend I flew from Salt Lake City to Boston and, both ways, the Airpods died on me. This is only a 4 hour flight to Boston and 5 on the way home. If you are doing longer flights it will absolutely be an issue. I actually had brought my Sony headphones with me because I kinda knew it was gunna be an issue. When the airpods died i just threw them in the case and put the Sonys on the rest of the time. This is important to me because, pre-covid, I was flying every second or third week usually. Having noise cancelling headphones is key to not feeling abused by the time you land. So I don’t know that Ill be using these for travel so much unless the flights are shorter. Either that or my Sony’s will have to tag along too.', \"Purchased from Amazon and after about a month the left bud wouldn't charge and wouldn't hold a charge.  When I contacted Apple they said it was out of warranty from the serial number.  I showed them my receipt from Amazon that I just purchased them and they still would not honor the warranty even though they were hardly 2 months old.  I demanded to speak to someone else to fix this issue.  The second person I talked to said it was indeed under warranty.  They emailed me info on where to send the product which required a $200 deposit.  I asked why would I have to pay a $200 deposit which they replied I would get it back after the warranty repair.  When I went through the process to pay the deposit it said plan as day on the form that it was non-refundable.  I wasn't about to pay another $200 for a product that was clearly defective.  Absolute junk.  There are many, many other options out there for a fraction of the price.  After 20 years of buying Apple products I am going to be leaning to other brands after this horrible buying experience with Apple.  At least my cats enjoy playing with the crappy defective pods.\", \"I admit, I must have a headphone fetish going on... I have purchased way too many headphones and earphones always looking for the best product. When I buy something to put in my ears I don't just look for best audio quality but also overall functionality, sound insulation, battery life etc. My last earpods were a pair of custom Ultimate Ears paid close to $1,000 which I thought were the best product ever until I lost them in a London taxi and I decided to try these AirPod Pro! Totally different product than the UE but so happy of my purchase! Best thing ever is the lack of wire between the two pods! I know, pretty standard now but for me, being liberated from the cord was a total eye-opener! Being able to go for a run or workout at the gym without that sticky wire behind my neck feels so good! I also like the no-brainer approach of not having a power button, they know when to be on and when to turn off. The press control is also awesome! it always works! wet hands, gloves, through the hoody... just work! always! overall audio quality is really good, not outstanding but don't feel the need for better quality in a pair of earpods. Also the noise cancelation works perfectly. I switch between on and off quite often based on what I am doing. Usually I like it to be off so I am not too isolated and I can be aware of things happening around me (a bike coming from behind, someone saying hi or a plane crashing on my house) but I turn it on when the background noise is too high and I want to listen to that podcast without having to crank up the volume too much. This was surprising! I don't usually write reviews but I guess I really want to tell everyone that this is the best listening device ever. I am still upset at Apple for removing the audio jack from iPhones but the AirPods Pro make it a little bit more bearable. Stay safe out there and always enjoy life!\", \"So, as I said in the title. I have had bluetooth earphones before, but the sound quality always seemed better with wired phones instead of bluetooth. But, I found these on sale and thought I'd give them a try. If I didn't like them I'd just return them. Man, was I wrong. These are better than any wired noise cancellation earphones I've ever had. The integration between my iPhone and iPad is awesome. I can switch between the iPad and the iPhone seamlessly. And the ability to switch between noise cancellation and non noise cancellation with the earphones themselves is a great added benefit. If I want to have noise cancellation I can just tap the right earphone and I hear almost nothing. If I want to be able to talk to people or hear what is going on around me I can also just tap again and it switches to non noise cancellation. This is a game changer, for me, for ear phones. Also, on charging.... The charging unit holds a good amount of charge. I was on a flight recently and the earphones went down to 5%. I put them in the charging case and after 5 mins of charging I had another hour of earphone use. Got me to my destination. The charging case does incredibly well at charging these super fast. I can't find a single complaint.\", 'I love these AirPods!  I’m not an audiophile by any means, but I like music and I like listening  to music with headphones.  I chose these over the original-style AirPods because of the earbuds, these stay in my ear better and make a great seal. The sound quality is amazing, and the features are absolutely fantastic.  Transparency mode is perfect for when I’m listening to music, but still want to be able to hear if someone knocks at the door or starts talking to me. Noise-cancellation is another outstanding feature.  I don’t think I’ve ever had headphones with noise-canceling that was this good.  I even showed my wife, I had her standing in the bathroom with the vent fan running, with the headphones on transparency mode.  When I switched it to noise-cancellation, she couldn’t believe it, she thought I turned the fan off! The little features like auto-connect when removed from the charger, music pausing when you remove one from your ear, and being able to switch those different modes right from the headphone itself is great. And don’t forget about the Dolby Atmos spacial audio.  It sounds like a complete surround sound system out of 2 earbuds.  It’s incredible. Another point I like is that I can start something, like music, a movie, or a video conference on any of my devices, and it automatically connects to the one being used. I can’t say enough nice things about these, but I do have a few things that I didn’t care for. Sometimes, the audio just pauses.  Now if you remove an AirPod, the music pauses, so I wonder if the AirPod sometimes works it’s way out of my ear just enough to pause.  Sometimes it even starts playing again.  But it’s annoying.  Also, if I take an AirPod out for a moment, maybe to talk to someone, and then put it back in, it seems to not want to start playing again when I “squeeze the stem” to play.  I have to actually take out my phone and press play from the lock screen.  This isn’t always the case, it only happens sometimes. One last thing is, with these headphones, and any wireless earbuds really, there’s a charging case you have to bring along with it.  It’s another thing I have to have in my pocket.  Now I can throw the charger in my backpack, but if I’m don’t listening to the headphones I have to find it and dig it out.  No big deal, but something that irks me. All in all, if you haven’t listened to a pair of AirPods before, borrow some from a friend.  And see how they stay in your ear when you jog or bend over.  These are definitely a lighter feel than the wired “EarPods”, and don’t pull out as easily. I love these, and I’m happy I bought them, despite some of the issues.', 'I bought three Earbuds of different brand to home office use from Amazon warehouse a month ago. Some how Samsung Earbud did not arrive due to technical issues and Jabra 65t arrived in time. Then i bought Apple Airpods Pro since Samsung earbuds didnt arrive. To my surprise Jabra 65t turned out to be really inferior quality and design and Airpod Pro could easily be declared as the winner. I had to request Amazon for returning Jabra. I had extended warranty period for additional 2 years by calling Apple customer care and within 20 minutes my product was covered and extended for 2 more years. Apple has a great support. There are multiple Pros for Apple product and two Cons - which is high price and they are delicate to handle due to its size. Again this is my review and it is considered for guidance only. I was hesitant to buy Apple due to its high price but after checking other product this is definitely worth all your money. It just works like charm and sync with your device in fraction of seconds. I have ordered its protection case last week and it will arrive on 06 September.', 'I decided to take the leap with these premium earbuds after trying a cheaper pair from another company. I’m so happy with the sound quality, the active noise cancelation, and the force-touch control. I was surprised how well the transparent mode lives up to its title. I can forget that my ears are sealed by these buds while in transparent mode. Having one bud feels just as natural as both or none. I like squeezing the stem to control them rather than simply touching these, it makes accidental operation non existent. Spatial audio is a nice feature but pretty subtle. I plan on exploring it more but I rarely watch movies on my iPhone or iPad. The active noise canceling (ANC) is so good! I can drive on the highway with my windows down and have a conversation as well as not have all that wind noise (and engine noise) in my ears. Pairing and Switching between my various Apple devices works so well and I love these for Zoom calls and FaceTime calls. The range on this is wonderful as I leave my phone and just walk freely through my apartment building. “Hey Siri” works so well with this setup too! Microphone quality is wonderful and sound quality aid top tier. Wireless charging works on all my charging bases. I find that I use these so much more than any other headphones I’ve owned.', \"First up, I'm not an audiophile so I don't pretend to offer any guidance on sound quality on those terms. As an everyday user of earbuds for work calls, phone calls, workouts, and so on, I just got tired of the poor quality of other cheaper off-brand options I tried before.  Whether it was trouble synching to the phone, connection issues mid call/song, or just limited battery life, I was never impressed. I finally caved and bought the AirPods from Apple despite the expense.  I can say I'm really pleased.  The soft silicone tips are a nice upgrade from the rigid plastic of the traditional Apple earbud, the sound quality is good for my needs, and I really like the ability to toggle from noise-cancelling to not with a quick squeeze.  The noise cancelling isn't perfect but you can tell a big difference between when it's on and when it's not.  Finally, the battery life is really impressive.  The case does a good job recharging the buds when you're away from an outlet and I've not run out of juice yet.  I also like that you can get an exact update of their battery life just by holding the case near the phone. At the time of purchase, the retail price on these was listed as $250.  I think you can find much cheaper options out there and I was able to get mine for sub-$200.  These are also exactly the types of products you can find nice discounts on around the holidays.\", \"This was already happening after only 3 months owning this product in August and I'm only writing this now because I had enough of this inconvenience. In order for my right earbud to work. I must connect the case (with the buds inside) first. Wear them. Then it would only detect the left earbud when BOTH are worn. Then I have to disconnect and forget this device. To then connect them AGAIN. Only then it would detect both earbuds. I HAVE TO KEEP DOING THIS PROCESS whenever I use them everyday to work out or listen to music whenever I'm cooking something. And I would even have to do these steps for other devices that I'm trying to pair with (like my iPad or my PC). I tried to clean them but the issue still persist. It is very annoying and I would suggest you having to search for something else (probably even cheaper) other than this expensive product that would lead you to having this kind of infuriating issue.\", 'I decided to go wireless when my much-used Bose SoundSport earbuds finally gave up the ghost after five years or regular use. I went for the AirBud Pro because of its reputation. I use a Samsung Note 20 and knew I might be missing out on some features available to iOS users, but decided to give them a try anyway. The sound quality and noise canceling are very good. The user activates most functions by squeezing the base of the unit. Apple calls it the \"Force sensor.\" Pairing the AirPod with my Android phone was straightforward. My first and most serious concern about the AirPod was the size. They are very small. They are also not quite as secure in my ears as the Bose SoundSport I had previously. In fairness, I did not try different sizes of ear tips. They initially felt secure, but fell out a couple of times. For that reason, a locator function is essential. iOS users will have no problems, but there does not seem to be an equivalent for Android users. I\\'ll admit that I could have tried harder to find a 3rd-party locator app, but the primary deal killer for me was the fact that they don\\'t have full functionality on the Android platform. The charging case is very small, which I\\'m sure many people will find appealing. I did not keep these long enough to determine how many charges I\\'d be able to get out of the case before recharging it. I\\'m sure any iOS user will be very happy with these. Android users, maybe not so much. If I were an iOS user, I would have given them four stars, possibly five.', 'When I first opened these and charged them it was pretty amazing - my iPhone 12 immediately recognized them and sync\\'d up, and I didn\\'t have to do anything else. Here are a few shared experiences that I hope you\\'ll find helpful: Phone calls: They cut out or glitch on calls for some reason. I usually just have to disconnect them and go on speaker phone. I went on a walk during a conference call and everyone was complaining they were cutting out. So I just disconnected and went to speaker, and all was good. I\\'ve tried them since on calls and I have had similar results. Irregular Charging: Sometimes the left ear bud has a lower charge than the right and vice versa. Can\\'t figure out why. The solution is to leave them on the charger for a day and hope it corrects. Most of the time that seems to fix it. Wireless charging and the charging \"container\": Wow, this is the future. the wireless charging is so easy and amazing, and the fact that the earbuds wirelessly charge in their own box and also nest perfectly in the box is pretty cool. One of the neatest features of these devices and probably the majority of the cost. Sometimes one works and the other doesn\\'t: The only solution was to \"forget\" the airpods in the bluetooth and reconnect them. I found this odd and kind of silly for a hardware/software solution that is otherwise pretty amazing.', 'I ordered these from Amazon when there was a $50 discount. At the time, this was a good price. Since then, it was offered with more of a discount.  Oh well. I like how the case is used to charge the Airpods.  I have a charging pad and I will place the case with the earbuds inside on the pad. When I go to use them, they are fully charged. They pair very easily with any Apple device.  The controls through the iOS can be somewhat difficult to find to make changes. The sound is very good for noise cancellation for earbuds.  I do not have any comparison for earbuds, but do have Bose over-the-ear which provide more isolation from outside noise. So, I will not compare with those. They fit my ear very good and do not feel that they may fall out.  I do think I am going to purchase some type of lanyard so I do not lose them when I am outside with them. Would be interested to hear from others on what they have used for this. I am amazing with the design and technology in such a small package. The range is very good.  I have had the source of the sound in another room and still had good connection. Where other bluetooth devices will start to break up.  I have not had a chance to check on how well they work in a room with others using bluetooth device, like the gym, and its ability for maintaining connection and any isolation from other devices.  This was a problem with some other bluetooth headphone I have used in the past. Overall, a very good earbud with good sound and isolation. I cannot say for the price without testing them out more.', 'I’m giving these only 1 star because I bought them from Amazon.  When these work they’re great and worth the money. When I received these all the correct packaging and cords and items were in the box but when I opened it the case was at like 50% charged, the right bud was at like 80% and the left one was at like 60%, so I thought that was a bit odd for “new” Air Pods Pro.  I should have returned them at that point. I used them for about a week and then the Bluetooth connection started to drop during just about every call I made.  Then after I reconnected them fully they worked for about another week.  Then today they were working fine and then a call dropped like 4 times with these.  When I fully reconnected them today they wouldn’t stay connected at all and even when they were connected it would only be for about a minute. I have no way to prove it but I highly suspect these were used Air Pods.  I’ve never had issues with Bluetooth headphones staying connected before and then all of a sudden I have issues with a top of the line pair.  Doesn’t really make sense. Highly recommend you buy these, because they’re incredible when they work.  Just buy them directly from Apple or Best Buy.', 'I was understandably cautious of spending two hundred dollars on earbuds but this was 100% worth it! The case is small, portable, and acts as a wireless charger for the earbuds when not in use. The AirPods come with 3 different sizes of ear inserts to help anyone achieve that perfect fit. When the AirPods are in your ear, your phone can perform a fit test to ensure they’re seated correctly. The AirPods have 3 modes, normal, transparent, and noise cancellation. Normal is exactly what it sounds like. Transparent modes allows sounds around you to pass through, very useful when doing housework or are at the airport and don’t want to miss important information. Noise cancellation is incredible. Compared to my older Bose headphones, they’re absolutely superior in every way. They’re pretty comfortable too, I only need a break from them after about 4-6 hours of use. Battery life is good too! One time, after a couple hours on a flight, I had to alternate charging them in their case, but the fact that the case can charge them like a portable power bank is dope and so convenient.', 'Beware! Beware!! you do not get a power box for this new usb-c cord so if you do not have the iPhone 11 already and don’t have that new kind of box you will have to spend $29.99 to get the box to plug it in. It is completely offensive to consumers in my opinion to charge $250 and not provide a matching way to charge your product. It’s gauging consumers and makes me want to return this. I am Writing  this with my 12 year old who worked hard and saved his money for the Pro version over the regular iPods his older siblings have. He and all the kids say these are amazing and are so much better then the regular version. The sound and the way they feel are far superior. “Worth my extra work to afford them, until I realized I would have to work several more hours to buy the box to charge my new product. That box costs an additional $30. WTH?! When you spend $250 you should get the power box. That’s a big frustration.”', 'Sound quality is amazing, it doesn’t have a ton of base, but rock music definitely still sounds good. Noise cancellation is great, I personally don’t use it but it’s good at cancelling out constant background noises like a fan. I use it with both my Mac and iPhone. It has this feature where it connects to both, and if you’re listening to something on your Mac and you want to switch to your iPhone, just start playing music or media on the iPhone, and it switches for you in an instant. Switching back the the Mac, while less convenient, is still easy. Just go to the control center on Mac, go to sound then select airpods then it immediately connects. Given connecting initially to just the Mac, can every once and a while be difficult, it’s convenient when it does work. Battery life is good, but not great. It’s enough where I can listen to music for a few hours, and it charged from 5% to 50% in about 5-10 minutes and gets you about an hour and a half of listening time, after 50% it takes more time to charge, but that’s what you’d expect. That brings me to the only problem. Sometimes I put these in the case at night, but when I get up in the morning they haven’t been charging. They charge fast so it’s not a big issue, but if the connectors for charging get any sort of water, sweat, or even just oils from your hand on them, they can take a few times to start charging. Luckily, there is a way to tell if they’re charging or not. When you open the case the light will turn on. If the case detects an AirPod and starts charging it, it will dim the light for a second. Sometimes I forget to do this, but it always charges if I get that dimming of the light for each earbud. Overall they are the best wireless earbuds you can buy, even with it’s really annoying issue.', 'At first I was happy with the sound quality and the product itself. Last weekend was doing biking (road) and one of the pods felt out of my ear ... since I was going fast I was not able to stop right away, and when I was able to, my pod was crashed by 6 cars over the road and I just thought \"Nooooo\".... when I was finally able to pick it up, I was shocked, the airpod had only a few scratches and was perfectly working ... still is.... I know that apple products might seem overprice but I can definitely say that this pods are the best quality ever!! If you are into sports this is the product you need to get!', 'I didn’t like the fact that these AirPods Pros didn’t come with the plug adapter for the USB-C cord...! If you’re gonna put the lightening charger & a new charging plug system(USB-C), then why wouldn’t you include the plug adapter so that anyone who purchased one of these things could charge it. Apple history shows us, without saying or speaking the obvious, that every time anyone purchases an Apple product, there was no need to even think about wether or not that this new device needed a plug for charging because we already new that it came with it...! So now Apple comes up with these new top of the line AirPods Pro, which aren’t cheap, without including a plug charger, what gives...!?!? One would think that it should be included for as much as they’re charging for them & why not, Apple includes them with everything else...that’s just poor planning & marketing when it comes to customer service...!!!', 'This is my second purchase of this product. First time was for me, this time was for a gift. That being said, I am usually very happy with my Apple purchases. However, I have been disappointed with this particular product, and I will explain why. Overall, the sound quality, convenience, look, feel, noise-cancellation and transparency modes, as well as the nice interface with my preexisting Apple products have all been great. However, there are a few drawbacks to this product, with one being quite serious. Minor drawbacks include battery life and compatibility with Windows (PC). The battery life is only okay, but the recharge is quite fast, so it counterbalances out, I suppose. The compatibility has nothing to do with Apple, and I have read that Microsoft is working on an update that will significantly improve issues. Now, for the major issue... I have had to return these for repair two times already, due to crackling/static noises that started shortly after purchase. When I sent them in for repair, they were completely replaced with new airpods, both times. I suspect that the cause for this is how I was cleaning them. I was using a disinfectant wipe - which you\\'re not supposed to do. However, since they have some waterproof protection, I thought that it would be okay. I even dropped one in the toilet accidentally, and it still worked fine. However, I suspect that something about rubbing them with a wet wipe (or maybe even using a regular towel, in lieu of a lint-free cloth), has caused this issue. Only time will tell, however. I have changed how I clean/maintain them, so I am hopeful that I will not experience this problem any further. An added note, for people that are looking to buy these for the first time, I did have some issues with them falling out or becoming loose, especially when talking, eating or doing some exercises etc.. However, I was able to completely solve this problem with AirPods Pro ear hooks. Just search for \"AirPods Pro ear hooks\", and it\\'s the Amazon\\'s Choice listing at the top, although, I\\'m sure other brands are just as good. It took a day or two to get used to them, and for my ears to feel comfortable, but after that, I couldn\\'t live without them, and I would recommend for everyone to use them if they have issues. EDIT: I am returning to revise my review because my latest airpods have once again become useless due to crackling/static issue. I made certain to be extremely careful this time and did not use any sort of wet cleaning, and was sure to even use microfiber cloth. I am so disappointed. I will never recommend these to anyone now. I love these when they work...but they are defective. Apple seems to know that they are defective, but instead of fixing the problem, they seemingly elected to just replace bad units and quietly extend the repair (replacement) program for them since it would probably be cheaper to do that in lieu of fixing millions of already-made units and starting from scratch. Sigh. Maybe the Airpod Pros 2 will be better. But honestly, I am afraid to buy them after this. Currently looking at the OnePlus Buds Pro as a possible replacement, since they are so similar and I might be able to use my 3rd-party wing tips with them.', \"I enjoy listening to all types of music. I can not tell you the number of times I have looked for the most perfect earbud, which will never exist. Anyhow, I have always been skeptical of buying any earbuds from Apple since the wired earbuds I would always get from them were mediocre. The sound was always good but the fit sucked. When I saw that the Airpod Pros went on sale I decided to give them a try. I am glad I did. These are pretty good wireless earbuds. I still have my Bose, which is good but the volume levels on my Bose sport were always so low that I would have to crank the volume all the way up on my phone just to get good sound. The Airpod Pros are much better in that department. I still have to level up that volume but not all the way up. The noise cancellation is good but I really have nothing to compare that with. I have read that Sony's noise cancellation is much better. I am not disappointed with the sound quality. I paired these buds to my laptop to listen to Spotify. The sound hardware and software on my laptop are much better than the iPhone I have. So it is a pleasure to listen to on my laptop. I'm sure that if I have lossless Apple music it would be different but I dont so I don't care. Anyhow nice earbuds Apple. Keep it up\", 'First of all, these were delivered super fast. I don’t even have prime and they came just two days after ordering! I bought these to replace my AirPods 1 and wow I’m happy I didn’t just get another 1st gen or 2nd. These are great. The noise cancellation through me off at first. The spatialized stereo mode also threw me off because it sounded like my music was being played in front of me in on spot but it’s cool nevertheless. I will say The sound quality is very good. But better than my AirPods 1. Bass sounds crisper. (Listening to music with them right now as I type this haha). I have no clue how good the battery life will be yet since I literally popped these in straight out of the box and the case is currently charging. The shape is weird but due to the necks of the AirPods being shorter, I guess the case is just accommodating for the shape. Just squashes character design cases… The comfort level is 10/10. The default ear piece fit my ears so perfectly that it’s easy to forget their in. They haven’t called out even after I danced to my music with them in. The real test is how they hold up at the gym when I’m sweaty and moving around more but I don’t think they’ll fail me there. Lastly, I was a little nervous seeing some of the reviews and the fact that I didn’t get it from Apple’s official site. But again, these didn’t disappoint. Overall, I give them a 9/10! Will give 10/10 when I see how long the battery lasts and if it beats my AirPods 1.', 'So I was nervous buying these because of all the “knock off” reviews. However mine arrived yesterday in the official Apple packaging and wrapping we have grown used to from Apple. They paired instantly to my iPhone and the noise cancellation and transparency modes worked flawlessly. So I hope that puts these weird “knock off” rumors to rest. As far as fit. They fit perfectly in my ears. I don’t ever feel as though they will fall out and I was busy doing yard work and physical activity the first day. I couldn’t hear the lawn mower or weed whacker at all, another testament to the noise cancelling capability. Music was full sounding and great bass and I only had my volume on 65% which normally with my Beats, I had to have it jacked to 100% volume. I get it, the Pro’s aren’t for everyone but the original AirPods hurt my ears. The Pro’s after hours of yard work, did not hurt at all. Extremely comfortable. Battery seems to be fine. I immediately used them out of the box and each pod was at 47% battery. They lasted for a couple hours without dying. Wireless charging case is terrific. I am not sure why people complain about yet another charging block. If you own other Apple devices, you probably have a handful of blocks already, do you really need another? If this is your only Apple product, I can see maybe being a little disappointed. At the end of the day though, it is compatible with any Qi charging pad, which a lot of people have. Throw it on the pad and it will charge the case and AirPods. Overall I couldn’t be happier. I would highly recommend to anyone that has an issue with ear pain using the original AirPods.', 'So I liked the features of this product well. There was just two issues I had with it. 1) the bass inside my ear canal had a negative effect on my hearing. 2) even with adjusting different sizes for the ear pieces the AirPods after some time would slip out of my ears. The fit was uncomfortable and would hurt my ears too. My favorite features is the ANC which you could opt the level of sound it would block out. To a degree it made it safe with having low volume sounds and able to hear an approaching vehicle when walking. I really liked that feature. I also purchased this item during a sale period which was a better deal than expected. Downside for me is I have sensitive hearing and it just wasn’t the right product for me specifically. However, for a regular consumer I recommend the purchase.', 'I purchased an open box from Amazon Warehouse. On close inspection and running some tests it appeared to be a fake so I returned it. Beware!', \"I owned previous versions of the AirPods, 1 and 2. I found them to not fit well. Yes, there are after market accessories that can modify the fit. However, the original AirPods did not have noise cancellation nor the Qi-compliant wireless charging case as standard. I then purchased BeatsPro, which are great wireless earbuds, but other than having the ear hangers, have the same problem with not fit snugly in your ear. I finally decided to pay more and buy these AirPod Pros. These are the best ear buds that I have every owned, They block out almost all sound (grandkids can be screaming and literally breaking things and I cannot hear them with these in my ears). I use them for meetings over Zoom several times a week, when viewing videos on my phone, and sometimes when I just want to block out noise but want to look like I'm working. Yes, they are expensive, but also, like most things Apple, the work, and work well. I personally believe that Apple could market these at a lower price, however, part of their marketing is to have lower, medium, and higher range products, for different people at different price points. That said, if you are totally into Apple (like I am), they work great consistently and seamlessly across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. Once paired with one of your devices, they are paired and available with all your Apple devices. Well worth the cost, in my opintion.\", \"I had been using the First Gen AirPods and have absolutely loved them.  They fit good and I have always enjoyed the fact that I can hear things around me.  Well, the battery life on them has degraded significantly so it was time to replace them. I considered the 2nd Gen AirPods but opted for the Pros.  Very happy with my choice.  They fit perfectly right out of the box with the Medium tips.  I appreciate that the tips provide the seal the OG AirPods did not and they can be used with Transparency mode on or off.  So it's like the best of both worlds as you can either remove all noise around you (which they do a fantastic job with) or you can use them with transparency mode off and expect a similar experience as the OG AirPods. I have many different earbuds/headphones and none beat AirPods for convenience--with Apple products like iPhone, iPad, Mac.  Size of the case is absolutely fantastic. Battery life on these still needs to improve greatly and is the only weak mark I'd give to them.  This is the case with any version of AirPods released to date.  They really drain when you use them on phone calls.  For listening to music or streaming they do last longer.  That said, I've no regrets and happy to have purchased them.\", \"These are hands down better than the OG Airpods. The fit, the sound quality and the bass on these bad boys are no joke.  Apple nailed ANC and transparency mode on these as well. If you're thinking about upgrading I definitely recommend it.\", \"First the good: great sound and volume, perfect Bluetooth connectivity to iPhone and iPod, transparent and noise cancellation functions very impressive and useful. The less good: The comfort was excellent but these fell out of my ears, so I needed to purchase foam type ear pieces. This was an 80% improvement, with only occasional falling out of ears.  I listen to TV and audio books for up to 9 hrs a day, so these get a lot of use. I try and charge them whenever they are not in my ears, and even sometimes listen with one, while charging the other, but I generally run out of charge almost every day. To listen to TV I use a Bluetooth adapter to the TV's optical audio port. The works very well except I needed to get an adapter that also provides volume control as there is no iPod-air integral volume control and the iPhone volume control has not be extended to function if the iPod-airs are paired with a non apple Bluetooth adapter (although the battery status monitoring seems to be). Also if I go a short distance from this (TV) Bluetooth adapter I loose the audio signal, even though I am still paired to this adapter (adapter has a light showing it is paired and a sonic signal when pairing is lost or regained). To get the audio back I need to place one of the iPod-airs back in the charging case for a second. Also this is a less than optimal solution as to change the volume for different programs on the TV I need to get up and make the change at the adapter. For some TV programs the audio is not quite loud enough, which is not a limitation of the iPod-airs, just of the volume control, as they have plenty of volume and the audio signal is clear.\", \"I bought it at $80 discount during black friday plus I already had a $40 gift card, so i only spent half for it. At the price I paid, I'd say it's worth it. Let me compare it to the mpow x3 I got at $60, less than a quarter of airpods pro. In terms of sound quality, they are just the same in terms of clarity & bass. I find the mpow x3 fits my ears better both sitting up or lying down. The airpods pro's touch control (more like squeezing) is more reliable, but mpow x3 touch is not too bad once you get used to it. mpow wins though thanks to the fact that i can change the volume with it. Who wants to call out siri just to increase the volume? that's just dumb. If you like light earbuds, the mpow also wins here. however, airpods pro is very well built. Once you hold it, you feel the premium. I know it's superficial but i can't help it.  it is really really nice. The airpods pro also has ANC which I think is pretty good. However, the magic of airpods pro lies in its transparency & spatial audio mode. With the transparency mode, I find myself listening to music/movie while cooking and can still hear my friends talking to me without degrading the music quality at all. It's extremely nice. To really enjoy the spatial audio, you gotta listen to supported video ofc. There are tons on youtube, try it out and you'll feel the magic. And ofc, if you're too deep into the applehole, airpods pro automatically switches between apple devices is quite nice sometimes too. overall, I'd say if you got a good deal then i'd recommend it. But if you only care about listening to music, watching movies, and don't mind manually switch between devices, get something else. Tatronics, mpow, anker, ... all build pretty good airpods alternative earbuds.\", 'I had the older version of AirPods and loved them.  I lost them so decided to upgrade. The new version have poor sound quality, limited battery life, are less comfortable to wear, and less responsive to touch controls.  All in all a poor value when decent Bluetooth earbuds, even active noise canceling earbuds, are available for a fraction of the price. Sound quality is very poor compared to the older version. With transparency mode on ambient sound is amplified with a tinny bright quality, with noise canceling on there is a distinct white noise hissing effect. If there’s a non-transparency, non-NC mode I can’t find it.  I own both Bose Quiet Comfort and Wyze noise canceling headsets and there’s no detectable noise with either of these when NC is active. The controls are unresponsive as far as I can tell. Grabbing the battery on one side or the other seems to toggle NC and transparency, but tapping seems ineffective. Can’t even get them to answer a phone call. The noise canceling might rely more on exclusion and sealing the ear canal seems to be important.  This makes them much less comfortable to wear. I often forgot I had the older version AirPods in my ears. Not an issue with these.  They are less comfortable, and also seem more inclined to fall out. The battery life is also very poor, maybe 90 minutes at best listening to music. CONSIDERING THE PRICE, I’d say they’re crap.', \"These are awesome! They are shorter and look better in the ear. They are shaped better so can nearly sleep with them in and don't fall out. Pressure balancing does great. Sound cancelling is minimal but works. The transparency mode is cool and helpful if running etc. They do not fall out, it would take a effort if they do. The bass is good, and they can be pretty loud. Really a good product. Update: These are amazing! Sound cancelling is good actually, especially for the office. Apple did a great job. I forget they're even there and they don't fall out. Update: Seems best full sound is with transparency and noise cancellation turned off. But those features are good if needed.\", \"Looks like I got the real deal. Lots of folks worried about counterfeits, lots of reviews, but mine appear to be genuine. Pros: The call quality is fantastic, apparently even better than my phone by itself. Noise cancelling works. Cons: Too often only one headphone works. Wait for the second to also activate, put them both in the box, close it. Re-put them in your ears, again only one works. Reopen apps, that didn't work. Disconnect the bluetooth, reconnect the bluetooth, oh, there they go. Sometimes when minimizing an app, then opening it again, specifically Youtube, I resume my video, and  now only one headphone works. They were both working fine a few seconds ago. Minimize the app, open it again, and now both headphones work. Today, they BOTH just stopped playing music, in the middle of a track saved to my phone. Switched a few tracks. Paused. Played. Adjust volume. Closed app. Opened app. Tried again. Nothing. Disconnected the bluetooth, reconnected the bluetooth, and oh, now the music works again. Once, the airpod device decided to disconnect from my phone, and refused to reconnect. So, phone and airpod devices full charged, I unpaired it, and attempted to repair like when I got it out of the box. The device remained undiscoverable for three days --- which means I couldn't pair it to my phone, which it was previously paired to. After three days, and almost a warranty claim, the device was discoverable again. There is no good fit. Often when I'm on a heavy exercise, these literally fall out of my ear into my lap, or onto the floor. I take them out now for my heaviest lifts. My previous cheap in-ear headphones never fell out. Sourcing the sound on computers is awful as well. My other bluetooth device, a soundbar from 2014, works as expected with sound settings & configs on the computer/apps/games on both the Windows OS computer and the Mac OS computer. Conclusion: Not worth the price-point, _Especially_ for being the flagship model at the end of 2020. I am _only_ keeping them because folks rave about the call quality, which, is what I got them for - a bluetooth headset to make & receive calls/have conferences with. I hoped they'd be so much more, as advertised, but even when using them for calls, this device is plagued by constant connectivity issues -- so only one ear works -- which maybe means I could have been better off with a single ear bluetooth device for calls, for a much lower price, and quite likely less connectivity issues. I cannot recommend this product. I would not purchase it again.\", 'pros: very, very convenient for iOS and mac owners fast charging easy to wear decent sound quality transparency mode is pretty realistic decent active noise cancelling cons: expensive battery life on the shorter end of the TWS landscape limited ear tip options included limits a good fit and affects the sound quality silicone eartips + the noise modes introduce uncomfortable pressure differences between the ears no noise cancellation mode (OFF) is not true - to achieve \"OFF\" mode, the earphones apply some noise cancellation, skewing the ambient awareness curve and also the battery life and sound quality. These aren\\'t bad, very compelling option for most consumers but as with anything in-ear, depends on how they fit and comfort. Seems Apple focused on ticking all the boxes that net them points. What they are not: audiophile-grade IEM\\'s. So please don\\'t go out there and gush all over the place about how they are the *bomb*, they are not. I personally think these are too expensive when looking at the big picture and comparing to other IEM\\'s. I\\'d suggest if you were the sole owner and intend to keep - go with a custom printed TW IEM like ADV Sound\\'s M5 Custom and spare yourself the headache of dealing with fitment issues, eartip swapping, custom ear mold shells, etc. for the increased price of those, you\\'re justified in the long run. I am more acustom to using wired bluetooth IEM\\'s, where I can have all day battery life non-stop of 8 hrs or more with at least the same fit and obviously much better sound quality - for the same price or less.', \"Certified audio engineer here. For me, it's been hard to use ear buds because they just don't fit me and i have to keep readjusting them. While not perfect, I find I readjust these far less than anything else. The extra ear silicone really helps. the sound is average or slightly better (for serious professional audio engineers) but it isn't offending. the convenience and seamless connections within Apple Ecosystem is tremendous. I didn't know it would automatically connect to my AppleTV! Now I can watch that without bothering the girlfriend when she needs the quiet. Noise cancellation is not as good as some others but that is okay for what I use these for. The mode that pipes in sounds from outside via mics is VERY GOOD. You can listen to your music but if somebody talks to you you hear it almost better than with the naked ear. Very pleasant experience in this mode. Well done Apple\", 'I had the regular AirPods but they kept acting hinky when I worked in the yard and would sweat a lot. I bought the AirPods Pro because they are water resistant. They work great for that but I had to purchase attachments that loop over my ears to hold them in. It doesn’t matter which tip I use that they provided, they constantly fell out. After nearly losing them multiple times I ordered the ear loop holders. Now they work great. I have gone back to using my old ones at work because they have a better battery life and I don’t have to wear that very noticeable ear loop holder to keep them in. This is disappointing as the pro was twice the price. I only use the pro on the weekends when working in the yard, exercising or doing anything at all outside. The sound is great with them and the noise canceling is awesome. I have small ear openings and attribute this problem to that plus the fact that the pros are much bulkier than the older style ones are. I’ve been told by a few other people that they have the same issue.', \"Honestly, it's not worth the price of admission. The sound quality is decent but severely lacking in the low end. Using a system-wide EQ on my MBP to causes volume issues. Even before the EQ I've had the volume drop for no apparent reason on multiple occasions (disconnecting and reconnecting fixes it). If you don't have an iPhone or iPad there's no way to update the firmware or use some of the other features, even paired to a Mac. They do connect very quickly and I haven't had any problems with them dropping out for no reason, but at this price I would expect nothing less. The auto-pause feature has turned out to be very handy. I don't really use the noise cancelling feature much because it causes uncomfortable pressure, but it does seem to work well. Bottom line: There are probably much better and much cheaper options out there and though I'm not terribly impressed with the sound quality, I will keep them because they work and I don't have to fight with them.\", 'This is the first wireless earbuds I\\'ve had, so I have nothing to gauge them by, but for the price, I expected more battery life. I have them on for a couple of hours of YouTube videos and they\\'re down to 15% or so, I haven\\'t tried recharging them from the case. I take them off and stick them back on the charger. I\\'m just using them around the house currently (because where can you go during lockdown anyway?) But I am concerned that if I ever take a flight again – will they last on a transatlantic flight? I primarily got them for the noise canceling and I assume that that will add to the load and shorten the battery life even more. If I\\'m on a 14 hour flight, I don\\'t want to have to take my earbuds out to recharge. Clearly I would need to have a backup. I have some cheap corded active noise canceling earbuds that last forever. I\\'m not a critical listener, I\\'m happy with any decent earbud. The only thing I ever worry about is bass. I listen mostly to classical music, so I don\\'t want something that advertises \"bass boost\". And these are fine. Mahler, Wagner, Berg, Britten, Beethoven. They all sound great. And if I feel like grooving out with Cream, Benny Goodman, Jelly Roll, or Django, they sound equally good. (Ginger Baker rocks!) They\\'re comfortable, something I was quite worried about because I have small ear canals (when I buy wax or silicone plugs for sleeping, I always cut them in half and they\\'re still on the biggish side). I\\'m using the smallest sizers for everyday, but if I needed to get on an airplane where I wanted to really block external sound as much as possible, I would switch up to the medium. I would be quite happy with them if they got twice the battery life. Come on, Apple! You can do better.', \"I was always on the fence about buying these because ear buds like these always tend to fall out of my ears after a short time. So far the only time these have falling out are when I hit my ear from the back or I forget they are in and take my shirt off. The noise cancellation option does work great. It doesn't block everything, but it does bring all the noise down to a very low rumble allowing you to concentrate more on what you need to do. I also tried the option where you can use them as hearing aids. When I say they work great at that is an understatement. I had someone stand about 150 feet away from me and talk in a normal to low voice and heard every word they said. However, when using them as a hearing aid. There is so much constant background noise coming through the air pods that you could only leave them on for a short time while trying to use them as a hearing aid. So you would have to turn this option on every time you needed to use it and off as soon as you are done with it. Otherwise the constant background noise will become very distracting. Also don't try to talk while having them on as a hearing aid. Your own voice gets amplified tremendously. I had to lower the volume before speaking and then turn them back up when trying to listen to the person talking. So I wouldn't really recommend using them for hearing aids unless it was a last resort. The only other problem I don't like about them is the connection via blue tooth between devices. When I want to use them for my laptop. I had to disconnect them from my phone and connect them to my laptop and visa versa when going back to my phone. If there is a way for them automatically switch between devices I haven't learned how to use them like that yet. But if they don't, that is something Apple may want to look into doing. I figure if my $60 plantronics headphones can do it a pair of $220 airpods should be able to do it as well. Other than that I really like these.\", 'I was kind of wary of buying these off Amazon as some of the reviews said they got fakes but when the price dipped down below $200 in December I went ahead and grabbed a pair. Mine were genuine so I don’t know if there’s in truth in that or I just got lucky. I previously had a pair of the normal AirPods and really enjoyed them but these are on another level for me. The best part of these imo is the noise cancellation in this small earbud form. Before purchasing these I was like “yea sure noise cancellation that’s nice” but after experiencing it I won’t ever be going back. I work in an environment with a lot of background noise and with these I can cancel that out and actual hear my podcasts or music without strain or turning the volume up to max. I also love that you can just press on one of the buds to switch over to transparency so I can easily press and hear what a coworker is saying when needed. After 3 months of use the battery life seems to be pretty good. I don’t use mine all day but usually put in at least 3 hrs of playtime daily and they don’t die on me. Also the case probably stays charged to keep the headphones juiced up for about 3 days with my usage before I charge it up again. Personally I’m impressed and this is probably one of the best purchases of 2020 for me.', \"First of all, yes these are expensive but I really think they're worth it if they're going to be your every day drivers. Here's why: They sound great, definitely above average. The sound is not the best out there (I think Liberty 2 pros are better in terms of sound quality) BUT the sound is still pretty great on the airpods pro. You can definitely enjoy listening to music on these and they're great for watching videos, listening to podcasts and audiobooks. The comfort and convenience of the airpods is what made me decide to get them (even though I'm an android user). The case is small, neat and wireless so don't worry about messing with charging cables. The earbuds themselves are pretty comfortable since you don't get that pressure feeling in your ears that you get from other silicone tip earbuds. You have noise cancellation, transparency mode and off mode. I personally use the transparency mode at work and it seriously feels like you're listening from a radio or speaker that's nearby so you're still aware of your surroundings. Noise cancellation works great too drowning out low frequencies (like the AC in my room which is pretty loud). I've never had any problems with phone calls, people on the other end can hear me clearly and I can hear them. Again if sound is all you're interested in then there's better options but the airpods pro are seriously great as an overall package. The only thing they lack for me is volume control but it's not too big of a deal (they have skip forward and backwards track, play/pause, and NC and transparency mode controls). If you have the money to spend, get them.\", 'Disclaimer, I own an iPhone 11pro. I  Compared AirPod Pro to the Sony 1000XM3 and Apple wins in every category. No app to download, it simply pairs. No triple tapping, just one or two, easier. Plugs are smaller and lighter, securer fit in ear. Easier to control functions by just squeezing the stems (they click). Case is much smaller to fit in pocket. Wireless charging. I finally got the sound on Sony’s to fairly match Apple with much messing around with the complicated app, equalizer etc. But the Apple has big sound right out of the box.  Apple did Jobs proud with their ergonomic design and convenience of use.', \"I am hugely disappointed in the AirPods Pro. On several occasions one AirPod will stop working and won't recognize that it is in my ear. To fix this, I have to completely remove them from my device, which removes them from every device and is basically a fresh start. Then add the pods back to my iPhone. Sometimes this doesn't work and I have to do it a couple more times. A big issue when removing the AirPods from your devices is that it resets all your settings. This means that the AirPods go back to their default settings and will connect to your AppleTV or MacBook when you are putting them in your ears to make a call with your iPhone. It's incredibly frustrating. Another bug is the microphone will stop working. To fix this I have to completely remove the AirPods from my device again. Another bug is that the audio will glitch and play a really loud noise every once in a while. I also had to buy third-party tips because the AirPods kept falling out of my ears. The tips that are included are useless. I know it's probably not an issue with most people, but the AirPods would come loose after about 20 seconds of putting them on which made the noise cancellation feature useless. After about a minute, they would fall out completely. I would think at this price, Apple would provide better tips. Edit:  Now I have to manually connect them in my iPhone’s Bluetooth settings every time I want to use them. This brought this down to 1 star from 2.\", 'I\\'ve had the Airpods 2 for about a year and decided to upgrade due to the two new Modes (Noise Cancellation and Transparency) AND for a better fit with the silicone ear tips. My, am I glad I did! I consider myself somewhat of an Audiophile (I have high quality headphones by Sennheiser and Beyerdynamics....over the ear AND in ear with both brands). I was \"okay\" with the Airpods 2 but the fit left much to be desired (my ears hurt after listening for any length of time and they had a tendency to fall out). The fit on the Pros are EXCELLENT (I use the Medium tips). The sound quality is light years better (due, no doubt, to the better \"sealed fit\" and to the two new Modes). Needless to say, I am one Happy Camper!', 'My AirPod pros arrived today. I was so excited. However, after three hours trying to get them to seat and seal in my ear, watching several YouTube videos on insertion, and chatting online with Apple support, I’m returning them. The Apple tech reported that they would not seal in everyone’s’ ears and tried to indicate that would not interfere with function. I specifically purchased them for their noise cancelling ability and for the ability to switch to transparent mode when necessary. Without a good seal, all background noise was apparent in the noise cancelling mode. I’m sad.', 'I purchased the AirPods Pro on Amazon Prime Day. They were almost 50% off the regular price. Otherwise, I would have been reluctant to make this kind of purchase at regular price. Out of the 5 different Bluetooth earbuds I got over the past 2 years, this has been the best set. I can easily switch between watching TV, talking on my phone, then going to a tablet. The Bluetooth button on the charging case is not intuitive to use at first because one can barely see the button. But my biggest gripe is the volume controls. For me, it has not been easy to use at all and it still is a feature that confuses me to this day. Pros: 1) Good Bluetooth connectivity 2) Can easily switch between devices 3) Comfortable and light 4) Well designed fit to ear 5) Well designed charging case 6) Excellent noise reduction 7) Excellent microphone 8) The rubber earpod material holds in ear well Cons: 1) Average battery life 2) The glossy EarPod material can be slippery (I drop them frequently) 3) Volume control is difficulty to access 4) Regular price for the product is very high 5) I am not sure how water resistant they truly are??? So, that’s a question mark. 6) Bluetooth connection button on charging case is hard to find.', 'The sound quality rivals those $500 noise cancelling headphones you see people wearing on airplanes! The noise cancelling is amazing but not quite on par with the best, though it’s not far off in quality! I had a pair of Bluetooth headphones that lasted 8 hours which I loved, these last half that time but you get such better quality. Watching movies is really great with noise cancelling on (like an IMAX theater!) The same can be said for music! I forgot to even mention the transparency mode, this is something that just doesn’t seem to exist anywhere else. It’s pretty nice to be able to listen to your music but be able to hear when you’re with friends or family! However, it depends on what kind of music you listen to. If you listen to loud bass songs with loud music as well, while there’s still a considerable difference, it’s not really worth it to use power for it. Again, it depends on the music. If you’re listening to Celine Dion, or Sam Smith, or any other artist who writes slow, beautiful songs, it’s great. If you listen to Ariana Grande with her loud singing, her music and her sick bass beats, it’s pretty useless.', \"So I loved my original AirPods, dog chewed them up and I needed new ones. I upgraded to pros and I was super surprised that these can act like hearing aids (entry level aids) with transparency mode. Apple even goes so far as to provide a questioner and hearing test to fine tune audio boost it provides. Given that I'm prone to reading lips in my everyday life and well 2020 with masks has me saying WHAT? ever two seconds trying to talk to people these AirPod Pros were a welcome addition to my life! Noise cancellation mode is also great. Just remember if you have multiple apple devices at your desk all at once to turn off bluetooth on the devices you are not using or you will have them inadvertently connecting to a different device they what your actively using.\", 'Noise cancellation is great Sound quality great ! Battery life great! However it is very hard to do anything with these AirPods . They don’t sit in the ear comfortably nor do they stay in the ear. Once I tilt my head to the left or right the music stops & the AirPods falls right out!!!! (Horrible!!!). I would have to reposition the AirPods 20 times durning a hour workout session which is very distracting and annoying. I’ll be returning this product ASAP and buying the first air pods again ( which btw I’ve had 3 sets off / they don’t last long either)  or a completely different product. I GIVE UP! P.S - air pods include different detachable ear pieces- non of which works for me . Save your money! Apple got this one WRONG !', \"The right airpod's sound quit working after 2 months and then COVID happened. We called Apple and they said they were sending a replacement airpod, it never showed up, probably due to COVID. I remembered to call them about it again a month before the warranty was up, I was told by Apple that I was going to have to pay for the new airpod, $165.00!! What!!!! They said the warranty only covered defects, ok, if the earbud quit working for no apparent reason 2 months after purchase I would call that a DEFECT! I had to stay patient and not rip anyone's head off over the phone!  I managed get to a supervisor on the phone who was extremely helpful and sent us the replacement airpod after placing a hold on my credit card until the old airpod was delivered back to them. So far, fingers crossed, the new airpod is working fine. Hopefully this will continue to be the case. Apple needs to do a better job of keeping their customers happy with their products. I should not have had to get a supervisor on the phone to do the right thing with their product. We spent over $240 for the airpod pro's, that's way too much to not replace one that has issues 2 months out for free without a fight. Shame on you Apple!\", 'I am a person who bought the original AirPods even though I knew they would not fit and the sound quality was average at best. You may ask yourself “why would he make these crazy sacrifices”? That is because I hate in ear headphones and everything I hated about them Apple fixed. As I stated previously I can not fit AirPods unless I mimic a corpse and sit perfect still but the AirPods Pro fit me PERFECTLY. I absolutely HATE the feeling of something being deep in my ear canal and poking against my eardrums and this is a feeling that most if not every in ear headphone offers. They all offer this EXCEPT the AirPods Pro, somehow and someway Apple made in ear headphones that don’t go in your ear, well at least they don’t feel as if they do because they are super comfortable and don’t offer that ridiculously uncomfortable feeling of something being deep in your ear and knocking on the door of your eardrum. Don’t ask me how they did, but they did it. The next reason why I despise in ear headphones and refused to wear them is because when you put them in and created that seal it’s almost like you can hear your brain working, it creates an almost underwater like feeling, but again somehow, Apple was able to mitigate if not completely eliminate that feeling. The 2 main reasons I can not wear in ear headphones are gone, but that’s not it, there’s more. The sound quality and profile is incredible, these sound WAY better than the OG AirPods and the noise cancellation which I could personally care less about, makes the world disappear right before my ears. I said all that to say that Apple did something amazing here and I absolutely love those headphones, they are well worth the money.', \"The noise cancellation isn't the greatest. Of course, our expectations for the noise cancellation won't be similar to Sony's  wh-1000xm3 be we should expect it to be pretty decent right? It's not. People have had concerns about the if listeners would hear a car or train coming up behind them but listeners have nothing to fear. In a relatively quiet room, the noise cancellation sounds great. Any fans, AC noise, etc is canceled out. However, once you start going about your day, outside noises can still be heard while having the volume 2/3 of the way up. Now that is assuming that the pros are able to stay in your ear. I tend to smile a lot throughout my day and sadly when I do, the airpods slip out. I tried both the medium and the small buds to see if my problem would be fixed. It wasn't. Compared to the gen 2 airpods, the pros have great additions. The noise cancellation and the replacement of the buttons used in previous generations are great. However, the pros do lack when it comes to fit, noise cancellation, and price. Additionally, they are not the prettiest. The short neck looks awkward and out of place. I recommend that you try before you buy. Go to an Apple store and ask one of the representatives if you can try on the pros before you buy them. Also, ask them to clean them beforehand. Perform a variety of head movements (depending on how confident you are in public you can try headbanging, head shaking, running in place, etc etc) to make sure that they fit properly. Finally, make sure you smile while you wear them.\", \"PROS  - Battery life is definitely better than original AirPods  - Listeners (phone calls & Zoom/Teams calls) report that my sound quality (mic) as good  - Sound cancellation works but is not stellar  - 3D spatial sound works and is cool but not a big deal IMO  - Pairing and sharing with different iPhones and Macs works well, and switching to these as sound source is much faster and more reliable than the get-1 AirPods that I replaced. CONS  - Poor Tip Comfort: the rubber tips are not comfortable. I even switched to the small size that came w/ the AP's (as recommended by the fit-test mini-app that is in the iPhone settings), and still ended up being uncomfortable after 20-30 minutes. Solution -- buy a set of aftermarket foam tips. I tried the Comply brand as they seem to have good reviews and they worked. Not cheap at $24, but they solved the problem and improved the noise-cancellation performance a bit. Disappointing that I spent well over $200 for AP's and then had to spend $24 more to make them wearable, but at least there is a solution.   - Pod Comfort: Unexpectedly, the body of the pod pressed against the cartridge of my right ear (only) and was quite uncomfortable. However, after continued use + the addition of the foam-ear tips (see above), I got used to it. I don't mean 'put up with it' but the discomfort went away, after about 10 days of use. Overall I'd recommend them. My 'pod comfort' problem seems to be a rare complaint, but the tip comfort complaint pops up in a lot of other online reviews, so be ready to drop added $$ for foam tips, possibly.\", \"I have a ton of Apple products, I've been a loyal customer for the last 15 years. My computers are amazing, my phone is amazing, my iPad was great, yada yada. These headphones are a complete and absolute waste of money. I have replaced them four times within the last year and a half, They have never left my house. I purchased them to do work from home during Covid, quickly realizing the battery only last about three hours if you are talking on them. Even with all of the feature is turned off. After about three months, one of the earbuds and evidently start buzzing loudly in my ear. This has been a consistent problem, despite having multiple replacement sent to me. I don't use third-party chargers, I'm disabled so I can't physically be rough on stuff, and I don't take them anywhere. All in all, I look like someone who can afford expensive headphones, and that's about the only benefit I get.\", 'These are awesome!  I do a tremendous amount of research before I purchase items like this, frequently buying and returning items if they aren\\'t exactly what I was looking for.  These Bluetooth ear pods are clearly the top of the heap at this time.  I love that I can use either of them alone, (or together), and they each have full controls.  (Most of the good ear pods can\\'t do that). I can access Siri anytime by just saying \"hey siri\".  They have great noise cancellation that I can turn on and off with a push on either of the pods.  I can skip forward or back a song, pause, play etc. - and again those controls are on both pods.  And the biggest surprise was something even Apple support incorrectly told me they can\\'t do - I listen to a lot of audio books, and by clicking either pod 3 times, it will jump back 30 seconds in the book, or jump forward 30 seconds with 2 clicks.  Anyone who listens to audio books will love this function.  The only drawback is a battery life of only 4.5-5 hours.  However, since I can use each pod separately that doubles the time.  Plus the case is the smallest I\\'ve seen, easily fitting in a pocket, and that charges the pod(s) very quickly.', \"The earbuds worked great for about a week or so and then started to have difficulty auto connecting to my phone. The noise cancellation feature also stopped working after about a month saying that I needed to have both earbuds in to turn on the feature- I definitely had them both in my ears as evident by my music playing through both of the earbuds. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting to solve the issue and that did not fix it. One of my biggest complaints is the truly terrible fit of the earbuds themself. They were constantly falling out of my ears and not fitting snug so the sound would be distorted. I would constantly have to adjust them in my ears which was more of a nuisance than anything. I did some research and found out that this has always been an issue with the AirPods Pros due to their fitted design- as opposed to the regular AirPods which 'sit' in your ears. I tried every size of the provided silicone tips and that did not solve the issue of them falling out/not fitting correctly. I switched from my pretty old 2nd generation AirPods and have decided to return the AirPods Pros and upgrade to the 3rd generation AirPods. The biggest takeaway from using the AirPod Pros for about a month is that unless you're planning on sitting still when using them, they're pretty useless otherwise. I would not trust them while participating in any activity because you're going to constantly be adjusting them in your ears and the likelihood of them falling out all together is high.\", 'Game. Changer. Love the silicone tips that allow for a more comfortable fit than first gen AirPods. The transparency feature is remarkable: I can pop in both and take a call, but still have enough environmental awareness with them to hear of my dog or kid needs me in another room. The noise cancellation is also really amazing. I was in a shared office space where 2 colleagues were having a meeting and as soon as I turned on the cancellation, I could barely hear them, sitting just a few feet away and speaking at full volume. Once I put on music, couldn’t hear them at all. Their range is pretty impressive, too: I can be connected to my iPhone or MacBook in my home office and still be connected to take the dog outside in the yard. Only drawback I’ve noticed: I keep my phone on a charging stand next to my laptop. If I’m on a Zoom call with these in, and I look away from my laptop screen and at my phone screen, the AirPods will toggle their connectivity between devices until I look back at my computer again. To solve this, I usually keep my Bluetooth turned off on my phone.', \"I've been a huge fan of Trekz Air bone-conducting headphones for years, but mine were starting to be unreliable (lost connection randomly and often).  Since I have been using them quite a bit for phone calls while working remotely, I finally bit the bullet and purchased these.  And I get the hype.  Easy to use, excellent sound quality.  I really do love them!  The only complaint I have is getting a secure fit in one of my ears.  I've tried all the tips that came with; and none would satisfactorily and reliably keep the left bud in place securely.  I opted for some after-market memory foam tips that seem a little more secure.  I guess I have a weird ear!  It is aggravating to pay this much for a product that I have to fight with to get to work. OK one more complaint.  They really DON'T hold a charge as long as my Trekz did.  No where near as long.  But much better sound quality, and I think for the user on the other end of a call, they're getting less background noise.\", 'UPDATE- After several weeks of use. I still love my AirPods Pro, however when making calls on my iPhone using the AirPods people sometimes remark that it sounds as if my voice is “down in a bucket”. This effect is not pronounced but I wish Apple could fix this. For this reason I changed my rating from five to four stars. Original review. I love my AirPods Pro. Are they perfect, no they are not. Are they really good, yes I marvel at what Apple has created. When you open the AirPods Pro case the earbuds automatically pair with your iPhone or iPad. From there on they seem to become part of your Apple device. By that I mean they behave intuitively and exactly as I expected them to. I fly often and use the noise canceling feature a lot. It works quite well as long as you have the earbuds tightly seated in your ears. Comfort - the earbuds come with three different size replaceable silicone tips. I had to mix two sizes to get a good fit. Really I wish there were more than three though. I can easily wear these for two plus hours. The. Noise canceling requires a good fit to work well. The sound quality is good. Are there better sounding earbuds out there?  Probably, but the seamless way these work with the IPhone or iPad cannot be beat. I’ll take these any day. One thing to note. Apple has managed the ergonomics so AirPods fit and hang in my ears in a fairly secure manner. However, you can knock them out of your ear and lose them. If you are on an airplane and drop one it is a bit of an adventure to retrieve them!', \"After trying several other, cheaper options for true wireless headphones, someone let me try their Airpods Pro. Immediately it was clear that they were far more comfortable than anything else I'd tried, and after a little research I found its the way they opted to design the rubber tips without the plastic, or sometimes when metal tube going through the center of the tips. The sound quality was pretty good. They weren't as good as my Sennheiser HD600s, but neither are any earbuds that I know of... true wireless or not. So it's more than acceptable, and thankfully they aren't following the trend of masking quality with excessive bass either. It's a pretty well balanced sound that is clear and crisp enough to not be distracting you with poor playback performance. Where they really shine is in the ANC. Apple may not have invented active noise cancelling, but in their usual fashion they took an existing technology and made it into the best product they could. They don't fully seal into your ear canal, as there is a channel through the earbuds so you don't get that ear pressure feeling like every other noise cancelling headphone I've used. To combat the ANC deficiencies that inherently brings, there's an additional ANC microphone tracking unwanted sounds in your ear canal! This effectively gives them some of the best noise cancelling I've experienced of any other headphones I've tried. It's really incredible honestly. I should note that I don't own any Apple products, so this experience is from the perspective of someone who can't actually make use of some of the features. But I did borrow an iPhone from a family member for a few minutes so I could get the firmware updated. Sadly there is no way to update the firmware without an Apple device of some kind. While I was at it, I also set them so the long stem squeeze would cycle through all three modes (ANC, Transparency Mode, and Off). Out of the box it isn't configured to cycle through the Off mode. I'll quickly say that transparency mode is also pretty amazing. You can totally have a normal conversation with someone without taking them out, and without stopping playback of whatever you're listening to. Sound quality and accuracy suffer in this mode, but I think it's about as good as it can be considering what it is doing. Very useful when needed, but I just don't use it often. Needless to say, that short time trying the Airpods Pro had me convinced. I ordered these before I even returned the ones I was trying. They're that much better than the competition... and this is coming from someone who typically prefers NOT to use Apple products. If you're in the market for true wireless headphones, and these are even possibly within your reach, do yourself a favor and stop looking elsewhere. I'm not aware of any other product that comes close to providing the features or comfort of the Airpods Pro. Seriously.\", 'Better than expected.  I have the second gen regular AirPods and put off buying these as I couldn’t justify replacing a working pair for an “incremental” upgrade. I had my eye on them - primarily as I couldn’t hear my podcasts when mowing with the regular AirPods at full volume, but otherwise loved them.  As silly as this sounds, the only real chance I have to catch up on my podcasts is when I’m working outside, often with powered equipment - so it was important to me. Saw them on sale, and my son was saving up for some AirPods - thank you for the handmedown opportunity/excuse to pull the trigger. They are everything you love about the regular AirPods, with surprisingly good noise canceling. I can hear my podcasts perfectly when mowing at normal volume , the automatic device switching works well so far which is an added bonus.  (I haven’t gotten that to work with my Apple TV so far. ) Battery life is good - I have them in all day while working - either on the phone or listening to music constantly, and they are getting low by lunchtime. A quick charge in the case as you are used to with the old ones, and they are good for the afternoon. Music quality? I think it sounds great but I’m not an audiophile. They do sound noticeably better than the old, but I’m guessing that is more the noise canceling than anything else. They stay in my ears fairly well. I had to use the smallest ear tips - and I am a grown man...maybe that explains my selective hearing. Anyway, love them. Loved the old AirPods, but wish I had upgraded sooner.', \"Bought these about a week ago. Returned them 4 days later. I loved the convenience features that came with these airpods; the noise cancellation, sound, low weight, and easy pairing process were all top notch. But what was that smell? I noticed an obnoxious glue/wet paint smell coming down from my ears into my nasal cavities, which was giving me a massive headache! I took them out, separated the airpods and the eartips, opened the case and let them air out for a day. The next day, I took a sniff test of the silicone eartips, the airpods, and the case, and there was nothing there. After reassembling the airpods, I wore them for 30 minutes and the smell was back with a vengeance. Looked up the problem online and it's definitely not just me, there is a 6 page forum thread on Apple forums that talks about the exact same thing. There's a picture on IFixIt somewhere in that thread that shows just how much glue they cram inside these things to keep them together. It's unreal! You wouldn't stay in a room with wet paint all day, but Apple expects you to put these nasty smelling airpods in your ear everyday? Not only this, but the smell doesn't disappear even after leaving them out to air for days at a time! I've sent a complaint over to Apple about this but the warnings about the smell were lacking on the Amazon page, so I'd like to give you a fair warning. 5 stars for the concept, -3 stars for potentially hazardous VOCs.\", \"Since we gave the AirPods Pro to our son one month ago, I think he has used them every day!  We were surprised how long the battery lasts and how fast it charges.  I have tried out the noise cancelling and it seems comparable to my Bose QC-15 over-the-ear headphones.  The QC-15's make me hot and sweaty, but these are cool.  I have the original AirPods and still use them regularly - especially for exercise.  They have never fallen out of my ears while exercising - except when I forgot they were in and scratched my ear.\", 'I wanted these to work so bad. Because they sound amazing. The noise cancelation is great. The sound quality is wonderful. I haven’t charged them since I got them and the battery is still going strong BUT THEY WILL NOT STAY IN MY EARS. It is so beyond infuriating to pay 200$ for a pair of earphones that just fall out. I’ve tried all the tips. The smaller ones help, but it also makes the earphones quieter. I’ve pretty much decided to return them.', 'Placement so that you get a full seal is critical to ANR and to sound quality. At first I thought the performance was only mediocre - especially bass - but after experimenting and getting a better seal in my ear canal, performance was quite impressive. There are however, issues with the AirPods inserted to get the best seal: I can’t get to the touch controls as they are pressed against the side of my ear, and they aren’t nearly as comfortable. The transparency mode is cool. It allows you to hear as if the AirPods aren’t in your ear at all, vs. “off” where there is still some muffling of outside sounds due to the AirPods being in your ear. With the silicone ear tips, they stay in my ear, unlike the old AirPods that kept falling out. While not perfect, given that they are relatively small, lightweight, are tolerable (at least for a while) in terms of comfort, and have good sound and ANC (at least when optimally inserted), I will keep them. Review of Apple AirPods Pro', 'I have been avoiding the Apple AirPods since when I tried them I couldn\\'t keep them in my ear and they constantly fall out.  The original AirPods did not have the ear piece that the Pro comes with.  The original was annoying with meh sound quality and no noise cancellation feature. The AirPods Pro are definitely different.  I don\\'t have any problem keeping them in my ear as I walk and the sounds quality is so crisp on both sides I have not had any bluetooth device work so well like these.  However, they do get a bit of getting used to since there\\'s no actual buttons or anything to push on the AirPods.  But get used to the following is not that hard: Using two fingers, squeeze the flat side on each AirPod. You\\'ll hear a click in your ear with each press. Single-press: Pause/play Double-press: Skip forward Triple-press: Skip backward Long-press: Switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode. Another cool feature that\\'s included allows the user to check which ear tip is better to use for you by allowing the software check the quality of the sound.  To run the test, open the Settings app on your iPhone, select Bluetooth and tap on the \"i\" next to the name of your AirPods Pro. Select Ear Tip Fit Test, and then follow the prompts. I ordered a second pair for my better half.', 'I was reluctant to buy these because I didn\\'t want white earbuds. Ha. So I bought wireless noise canceling earbuds from both Sony and Bose, and I was disappointed in both. I just bought the AirPods Pro finally and I\\'m glad I did. Here\\'s why: The sound quality is great, and the noise cancellation is actually the best I\\'ve noticed in wireless earbuds yet. I have NOT used them to make a phone call and I have been told they are not that great there, but for everyday use, these are great. Additionally, if you\\'re in the Apple ecosystem (and you probably wouldn\\'t be buying these if you aren\\'t), things just work nice and easily. You can pair them in seconds, when you turn them on they make a nice friendly jingle but no voice saying \"battery 80%\" or something stupid. Some bonus points: the case is smaller than the cases from Bose and Sony, and you can put the case onto a Qi charger. The built-in controls you get on the iPhone are great too, and this is simply a moat that other vendors can\\'t compete with given Apple\\'s control of iOS. If you\\'re living in the Apple ecosystem most of the time and you want good everyday wireless earbuds, these are the way to go. Don\\'t make my mistake and blow $500 on other earbuds. Just cut to the chase and use these. The one major suggestion I would have for these is to allow the user to somehow change the volume using the airpods directly, rather than having to reach to your phone. Otherwise I\\'m quite happy.', 'Sound great, good battery life, decent noise cancellation. Third pair - as first was replaced as it kept disconnecting, 2nd pair thrown out of car window in rage as kept disconnecting during important call, 3rd pair - well you get the picture. Will continually either say \"connected\" on iPhone, when they are not. Will rando disconnect from iPhone and connect to say laptop (yes, I disabled the \"auto switch\" feature) or just randomly disconnect. Will sometime not even connect even if pressing button on case with an arbor press. If I were Apple I\\'d worry about the steadily and rapidly plummeting quality and reliabilty since Steve Jobs left this mortal plane of existence, and worry less about \"bad apps\" in the App Store.', \"I have been saving my cashback for just over a year and wanted to buy something nice once I saved enough, I have been eye balling Airpods for sometime now as well as some highly rated over the ear headphones, all wireless as I have a pair of Bose wired earbuds and love them. I debated to go Pro or not to go Pro when choosing which Airpods to buy and after trying out some Pro's and then the non-pro's the Pro's were a lot more comfortable for me at least so since I could always send them back I decided to buy the AirPod Pro's. I wish there was not such a huge price difference between the two or I probably would have bought a pair sooner. I tried the medium size inserts and they fit well, since I was working an event I wore them everyday all day one at a time so I could always have one charged and ready to go and after switching to the small insert they are prefect and I can wear them for hours and not have them hurt my ears. The button to switch modes is a bit temperamental and you cant use noise cancelling unless you wear both so one issues is I need to get used to the button and the other is by design. Decided to test out the charge life and I got wearing one at time all day, everyday, a total of 5 full days of charge before I had to charge the case. I especially like how they can connect to my phone and iPod at the same time so I can always see what the charge is. Wish the button was a bit easier to work with, but very happy with my purchase.\", 'I bought the first generation AirPods when they first came out. I didn’t mind the style despite all the jokes in social media (ear tampons?) and I loved them except for the fact that they’d constantly fall out of my ears. I know I wasn’t the only one with this problem but I’ve always had trouble finding in-ear buds to stay in my smaller than average ears. The AirPods Pro fix all of that. I tried the medium size ear tips that were already equipped, and the AirPods were popping out of my ears after a few minutes. I put the small ear tips on and they haven’t popped out a single time. I even purchased a cellular plan for my Apple Watch again so I can take walks without having to carry my iPhone and still be able to enjoy music and answer calls, etc. I hadn’t had a use for it until the AirPods Pro. They have a lot of features that I really love, too. The noise canceling is top notch. Transparency is a little weird to me though. To me, its the equivalent to putting a glass against a door and putting your ear up to the glass to listen to people on the other side. It just sounds weird. But, I can definitely hear the people around me so I guess it’s doing it’s job. I much prefer the tactile feel of the stem button to the tapping on the old AirPods. Tapping just made them pop out sooner, usually as I was tapping them, so I never used those controls. The AirPods Pro stay secure in my ears even when pressing the button. I love that I can use the button on either side, too. My love for Siri has blossomed with these, too. I was never a fan of Siri but after wearing these for a week, I think she’s great. She definitely gets a bad rap. She got my requests every time, quickly and accurately. She never missed a “Hey Siri” even in noisy environments. And I like that they did away with the Siri “tone” and made her more human like by responding with “Hmm?” or “Mmhmm” when you talked to her. Her response time has gotten so good that you don’t need to wait to listen for her to acknowledge you. Just give her your command and it works. I like the audible acknowledgement is just to help people bridge the gap between “old Siri” and “new Siri” so they know she is listening. Lastly, sound quality is great, of course. It’s not the best sound experience for audiophiles and you’ll want a much more expensive over the ear headset for that, but for in-ear buds, these are great. I have zero desire to walk around with a bulky headset on and these sound more than good enough for me. They let me disappear into my own world while out for a run and allow me to escape the noise of the city for a little while. That makes them priceless to me. So glad I picked them up!', 'The first thing I want to talk about is how these don\\'t stay in my ears as well as the 2nd gen AirPods did. Everyone has differently shaped ears, but this is my experience. I\\'ve tried all 3 of the buds and the largest ones appeared to have the best fit, despite not being a large person (5\\'7). There is a \"fit test\" you can do which helps determine which size buds are best for your ears, so I suggest doing that (on your phone, go to bluetooth settings > tap the \"i\", then select fit test). The good news is, there are 3rd party manufacturers which make memory foam tips which supposedly help with this, so I ordered some to give that a shot. Onto the buds themselves, I don\\'t leave the house without these. They\\'re as attached to me as my keys, wallet, phone, and my mask. The sound quality is great, the portability with a charging case is really convenient, they swap over to the device you\\'re using with ease (such as going from an ipad to your phone), and the noise cancelling is pretty good though it doesn\\'t compare to over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones. If you\\'re debating between these and the 2nd gen airpods, I would say go with 2nd gen airpods unless noise cancellation is a big deal for you or you prefer using tips as opposed to the static form factor of the airpod 2nd gen', \"Upgrade 6 months later: I still wish I got the entry level airpods. I loved the old airpods. They were the best purchase in years. Wish I stuck with just replacing the old model. I got these for only $160 and will still be returning them. The major WTF: In the advertising and apple fan space, these are presented as having many new seemingly great features, but one of the most important and useful features of the old airpods is gone - being able to tap. The control on these new ones is a button. This button can't be tapped, but it has to be squeezed, between two fingers, precisely. Clean, dry fingers. And it is small, and the stem itself is shorter. There goes listening to airpods while doing yard work, or hiking with gloves on, or while cooking and doing the dishes. That is, the majority of my use cases for airpods. Before I could tap with the back of my hand. Heck I could even double-bonk the general side of my head with an open palm and control my airpods. I will be returning and getting the old ones. 7 other major beefs [I see no reviewers mentioning these and it feels like apple fan gaslighting...] 1) It is weirdly difficult to get these things out of the case, I am pretty dexterous and even when my fingers aren't number it takes a fair amount of fiddling to get these out. 2) Transparency mode is only necessary because the new design makes it impossible to hear your surroundings. Even with transparency mode turned on, it doesn't fully restore the awareness of your environment that the old airpods had. So this isn't a feature but a failure to fully address a new bug. If the volume is at half way, I can't hear my wife speaking to me from the other room. 3) Believe it or not, these fall out easier. It is simple physics, the head of the uit is about twice as long sticking out of the ear hole. It doesn't rest fully in your ears the way the old ones did. I have worn these for one week and they have fallen out three times. That very rarely happened with the old ones. 4) It takes longer to charge the airpods once you put them back in the case. 5) My experience is that battery life is functionally much lower. If you press pause on your music, and leave them in for say 30 minutes with no music playing, noise cancellation and or transparency mode are on unless you go out of your way to turn this off each time. Those two functions take battery power. 6) The charging cable is useless unless you have the new apple USB C outlet. You can't charge this into a regular usb port (you know, the kind you see in 99% of charging outlets). You'll have to buy a dongle. 7) The case lid is more fragile - mine already wobbles after a fall and I have had the thing a week. My old pair have no issues. I think this just comes down the geometry and mass distribution of the new case design. 8) I have dropped these about 3X as often as the regularly shaped airpods. 9) These airpods, no matter how often I reset them, will play regardless of whether they are in my ear or not. Pocket, kitchen table, even IN THE CASE itself. In addition to being obnoxious, keeping these airpods pros out of hte case for about an hour seems to drain them the same amount as if they were playing music, probably because transparency or noise cancellation modes are still active, given their inferior ear detection. Some pros: 1) The bluetooth range seems to be twice as far. I can walk around my whole house and have great reception. 2) Noise cancellation is great for when I am in a car (and in a plane, if I am ever in a plane again), walking down a city street where there is traffic noise. I can listen to music in the car now and car sounds are gone, replacing my crummy car stereo. Noise cancellation is a big pro, but on balance, it doesn't make up for the issues above IMO. Minor obscure beef: The whole package is larger and heavier, so if you are a gram-counting ultra light backpacker, know this seems about .3 ounce heavier. If this is your first pair of airpods, expect a 2 year use life. Another thing no one tells you but the batteries will die after two years. They're worth it to me despite the e-waste.\", 'I can only tell you what I like about these as I’m not very tech savvy. First I’d like to say, if AirPods 2nd gen are too big for you, these will be too. The AirPods Pro do not fit as well as I’d like, but that’s not the fault of Apple as I have smaller ears. That being said, they do stay in, I just don’t get the full noise cancelling effect I should. One ear is much better than the other, so I definitely can see where it would be if both ears fit well. But it’s still great. Makes my barking dogs seem off in the distance. (Always a plus!). Music, I think, sounds great! More bass than the 1st gen. I have heard one song where the bass was so loud it was distorted. Don’t know if that is from the song itself or the type of music. (Imagine Dragons: Radioactive). I do like the silicone tips. Each ear uses a different size, but you are provided with two of each. More are available from Apple until a 3rd party comes out with them. Phone calls are very clear. My friend says it is loud and crisp on her end. My end sounds great also. On an extended call, I wore one for almost 3 hours give or take, and then used the other one. Some Bluetooth earpid sets only offer speaking in the right earbud, while with AirPod Pro either can be used independently. The price was a bit steep, but got them 20% off. I don’t at all regret buying them. They are my go-to Bluetooth.', \"Trying to find a pair of wireless ear buds that work.  I tried the Samsung Beans, Google Pixel Buds sent both back. I figured I would try Apple airpods pro.  The fit was great for me.  Better than the beans but on par with Pixel buds. I am using Andriod with these so I did not get all the bells and whistles, but that is okay.  I just wanted a good pair that connected and stayed connected (Google's didn't).  I have had them for 5 weeks now and they are dead. Cannot charge them anymore - charging case dead, I guess.  Contacted Apple Support (awful experience) and now they are sending me replacement.  Great, but I am getting three packages (one for each earbud and case) - insane. I have been waiting for week now to see if the replacement works.  I still don't have replacement for the charging case.  I have the earbuds but no way to charge them.  Not very happy at the moment.\", 'Really love these! I tried the regular ones first and they just don’t fit me and the pod design never has, they hurt my ears. These however with the custom tips are great! Really solved the fit issue for me. The ease of use is the key selling feature for me here - automatically pairs, easy to switch back and forth, no need to power on and off manually, easy to charge. They stay in, they’re sweat proof. The noise canceling is AWESOME. I was honestly shocked how the hum of my refrigerator completely disappeared. That’s not going to remove the sound of my roommate talking on calls or the neighbors out on their porch, but it’s a great feature for dulling noise. Something I’ve never had headphones do so well. Sound is good, nothing too fancy and not super different from the regular AirPods. The price tag is steep; I got these on sale and felt that was worth it, but I definitely would not have paid full price and would have shopped around for something with better sound quality. These are fine for me though! I’m not sure if some people got different products, some reviews say “fake”... but mine are definitely legit! Sealed apple box, has the vents for noise cancellation, everything looks just like I expected.  I have absolutely no concerns with them being fake. Bought mine in November 2020.', \"I knew that the audio quality wasn't going to be its strong point from the get go. Don't get me wrong, its not bad, but I didn't buy airpods pro for the audio quality, but its convenience. These are about the best wireless devices, period, that I have ever used. It took less then 2 seconds to pair to my phone, and they work seamlessly all the time, have great battery life, and pretty amazing noise cancelation. And the size of these make them super portable, and often forget they are even in my pocket, which makes them ideal to take just about anywhere. The ability to easily go into and out of transparency mode allows me to keep them on pretty much all the time. Its made grocery shopping a lot more entertaining. Their range is pretty fantastic and it works well with voice commands. I cant say if you'd have the same functionality with Android but the integration with the Apple ecosystem is amazing. I can even listen to the Apple TV through the headphones when I'm watching things late at night.\", 'The AirPods Pro sound great if you are just listening to music, podcasts, calls, video calls, etc.  The ANC is really cool. Why these are getting a 1-star review:  I am constantly getting told by people on video calls for work that they can’t hear me or the audio is garbled.  Normally I am doing calls in my home office with low levels of normal house noise if other people are home.  Sometimes I can push them deep down into my ears for a second and that seems to help but it’s super annoying.  I am going to have to buy another solution to do work calls which basically means these were a waste of money for me since that was to be their primary use case. Check out the thread on macrumors, check out the support thread, this is a real issue with the hardware impacting lots of people.  Don’t waste your money on these unless you are only planning to be listening, not using the microphone. Oh yeah, the battery is not great either.', \"I bought into the whole Apple ecosystem, and I expected to have a great experience with these AirPods Pro.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They are just terrible. If they don't fit your ears well, as they don't mine, you may have a similar experience. Out of the box, they failed the ear-seal test for me.  Even after purchasing moldable ear cushions, I still failed the test.  As a result, I experienced: - The bass response is thin, really thin.  I don't mean thin compared to Beats; I mean thin compared to audiophile earbuds. - Noise reduction so weak that I had to cycle through the settings to make sure it was on. - They are continually falling out even with foam ear tips installed.  I also added ear hooks, and one still fell out on my walk today.  Of course, you must remove the ear hooks before charging the AirPods. I spent my early career working for a high-end audio manufacturer, and I think I know how good headphones sound.  The AirPods Pro, when the ear tip test fit fails, sound mediocre at best. The bottom line for me is, if you can't pass the ear tip fit test, send them back immediately.  Your AirPod Pros will sound like $50 earbuds.\", 'I bought these to use on the endless Zoom meetings that COVID-19 has gifted me with.  I\\'m also a college professor, and I prefer to teach classes and record presentations standing up for the additional energy level.  After having a \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" moment during a board meeting where I dropped by iPad stylus and almost choked myself on my wired headset, I decided going wire free might be worthwhile. I have a nice setup at home - my work upgraded Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga, my personal 2016 MacBook Pro and older iPad Pro, external monitors, Hi-Def cameras, a green screen, and lighting (most of which I bought on Amazon).  I usually teach/Zoom from my Windows 10 PC. The Bluetooth on Windows PC\\'s splits input and output in a way that it reduces the sound quality to mono for bluetooth devices. That means that unless you have superb hearing, you can\\'t hear through the AirPods using Windows for both input and output.  I solved this for Windows by using the mic on my Logitech HD camera for input and the AirPods for output. I\\'m happy and the people I meet with are happy.  I did purchase a wireless mic to try to use, but it is likely going to be returned as the camera sound is so much better (although background noise is a concern with the camera mic).  There is a $75 Jabra USB adaptor that will reportedly make the AirPods work, but reviews are mixed on that and I\\'m not sure that\\'s my best option. Of course, if you stay within the Apple ecosystem the AirPods are fantastic.  They hurt my ears for about a week, now I find I forget I have them in.  They work great with Zoom on my MacBook and iPad, and for phone calls on my iPhone.  Music sound quality and noise cancellation isn\\'t quite as good as the free pair of Beats over the ear that came with the MacBook, but I like the small size and the Beats also hurt my ears after awhile. When (if) I ever get to travel again, I\\'ll end up packing both the AirPods and the Beats.  They each have their best uses and since most of my travel is business related I need a backup at all times in case batteries die, I lose something, etc... Back to Windows for a moment.  I also find the Bluetooth control on Windows to be a little selfish. :)  Once it gets hold of my AirPods (connected) it doesn\\'t want to let my iPhone have them back....  The solution to this is to leave the AirPods paired with Windows Bluetooth at all times, but to manually connect/disconnect when you want to move on and off of Windows.  It took me about a week to get used to doing this and now it\\'s pretty automatic.', '1. Delivery : If it is any Apple product = Must Buy from Amazon. Superb Secure Delivery and Handling. 100 Stars. Recently ordered from Apple.com with Extra Fast courier service, the Uber delivery person took it and disappeared and marked delivered and Apple.com took my money. Contact Apple and they say they will investigate and let me know in 72 hours. So I lost both money and item and have to wait until Apple employee email me of outcome of their investigation. 2. Sound As soon as put it in the ear you will notice the NC is working. And the sound is as advertised. 3. Battery Arrived with 75% charged. Both Wireless & Wired charging system works fine. 4. Pairing Open the case, iPhone shows the Airpod Pro and super easy to pair and start using them. 5 Stars Product and 100 Stars Delivery and handling by Amazon.', \"This will not be an exhaustive review of the two products.  I lost my Airpods Gen 2 on a flight and after some (probably too much) research I decided to buy the Powerbeats over the Airpods primarily for two reasons: - I've never been blown away by the sound quality of AirPods - AirPods just dont fit my ear canals well I've used the Powerbeats for 4 months now and the sound and the fit is really good.  However, after an hour or two the loops do get uncomfortable.  I'm really impressed with the battery life of the Powerbeats.  Believe it when they say 9 hours. Im on a LOT of conference calls using either my phone's bluetooth or my laptop bluetooth for MS Teams or Zoom meetings.  The first weakness I saw with the Powerbeats was when people commented that the microphone sound quality wasnt very good.  Previously, I used my AirPod G2s which were great sound an microphone for calls. Since Covid, Im in even more conference calls and the Powerbeats just arent comfortable, and the PC connection is troublesome.  I broke down and ordered the AirPod Pros and used them this week. Bottom line: - They are very comfortable for a day of meetings - The battery life is just 4 hours so that's a drag - Call Quality is excellent - Connection to phone and PC is fast and reliable - the new ear pieces fit my ears MUCH better than the G2s - the case is small so carrying them in my pocket is EZ again - The PBs still sound better with music - I will use the PBs for workouts and yard work since the fit is great I hope this helps any of you facing the decision on AirPod Pro vs Powerbeats Pro.  If you have the budget, give Apple all your extra money and buy both of them...  Spread out the purchases so your 'significant other' doesnt catch on.\", 'I bought AirPod Pros from Apple and lost them after a few months...my bad. Looking to replace them, I searched the post-Christmas sales and found a pair in the mid-$130s from a site called FirstDealMax. Looked legit and I was looking to get back into the AirPod Pro club. Short story - they were fake. No box, no serial number, wrong model numbers, inferior connectivity, inferior sound etc. (first pic - stem pointing to right) No response from them and ultimately filed charge dispute with my credit card company. I bought REAL replacements from Amazon and SO happy to be back into REAL AirPod Pros. (pic with stem pointing straight out of picture) Sound is outstanding for size, the noise cancelling/transparency sound options very useful, works great for music/podcasts/meetings while keeping hands free. Seamlessly switches if you change listening ear. So - be careful. There is a BIG counterfeit market out there (as I learned). The fakes are surprisingly similar and I picked up on differences quickly only because I was familiar with the genuine product. I might have just thought Apple made a bad product if I didn\\'t know better. Stay away from FirstDealMax and other \"too good to be true\" price peddlers.', \"I am overall a big fan of apple products, but I was skeptical about the AirPods.  It goes back to the free earbuds that came with every iPhone I have received several of over the years that were not very good.  I just didn't have a good impression of Apple having good sound technology.  I only decided to pull the trigger because of functionality.  Because I have a MacBook, an iPhone, and an iPad, adding the AirPods to connect to them just made sense, even if it wasn't the best sound.  Since I had planned on using these for work, functionality was more important. After using these for the past couple of weeks, I stand corrected.  The sound has come along way from the free wired earbuds, and the noise canceling feature is remarkably accurate.  They even tell me if my seal isn't intact.  As rich and quality as the sound is, the best feature is the functionality and connectivity.  If I switch from one device to another, the earbuds switch with me.  This is great for me when I am working as this saves me time, and it truly separates them from anything else I have used.  Battery power has been plenty long enough for me, I charge them nightly and I am sure they would laster longer if I were to forget as they have never run down. This was a great purchase, not sure previous iteration of AirPods were quite so quality and functional so I am glad I waited.\", 'AirPods Pro is better than AirPods Comes in a small box that includes the ear bits sizes small and large. (Concluding that medium is already on the AirPods). And also a usb c to lightning which requires you a usb c charging head or using a Mac. Although you can just use a required lightning to usb to charge it as it has the same charging port as the iPhone The basic Bluetooth connecting is simple and should be easily connect to an iPhone.  On an iPhone it shows you the tips when you first acquired and use the AirPods. When connected it to an iPhone and opening the lid, there is a pop up showing how battery the case and AirPods have. (Battery can also be check with battery widget) It can connect to any other device with Bluetooth and it works pretty well. Finding the right size was simple as I did not have to change the ear piece, although when trying to remove the earpiece was tricky. Video experience: So the main reason I bought AirPods was to watch videos. I always if I didn’t have AirPods have to turn the volume really high or bring it closer to hear it but with AirPods you are able to put it on and watch at a good distance. The Bluetooth syncing or how the mouth and voice are in sync is a good sign and for some Bluetooth earphones I used in the past (that was cheaper) the mouth and sound was so not in sync so It wasn’t good to watch videos but for music it doesn’t matter. AirPods Pro got that checked Music: No data although when using on the laptop, in the sound settings for AirPods there’s bass boost and volume equalization just like my regular Bluetooth speakers Battery life: 4-5hours about 20% on the earphones (Noise cancellation may use more battery) About 5 times charging on case for case to be about 23% maybe bugged but when using one AirPod battery drain faster? Unsure about that Also probably like most apple products battery will degrade in about 2 years:( Noise Cancelation/Transparency mode: When first putting on the AirPods it was noise cancellation mode and I was like Woah what happen to the sound and some barely noticeable frequency pitch as my ear get used to it. The noise cancellation gets activated when holding the AirPods button and hold again makes it transparency. It was really interesting using the noise cancel mode to tune out the washing machine noise and everything else as I was able to hear my sound clearly. Although noises like the high pitch sound the Cricket makes still goes through like it was cancel at all, making me believe higher pitch sound (wouldn’t be canceled) When activating noise Cancelation you are able to hear your sound even with lower volume. Transparency mode: just allows you to hear the outside world same like using (inexpensive headphones) I believe it uses its outside speaker to get the sound and play it back into your ear. Because when I cover it, it’s like my ear was being covered. though noted: sound is still played though the AirPods. Unlike noise Cancelation mode, the transparency mode makes your sound lower so you have to turn it up to hear it better. There is also an OFF mode so it acts like a simple AirPod Also you are able to use noise Cancelation in one ear if you go to the accessibility options of the AirPods EnGraving: Amazon doesn’t do engraving, only at Applestore app you can get an engraving (free) although it takes longer to ship and is 250$. On amazon the prices of AirPods is not at 250$ and that it doesn’t take a long time to ship on free shipping. So unless you want your name on the AirPods go engrave on apple if not just buy from amazon. important info: Unable to change the sound of the AirPods manually, only way is using Siri or using the device your on and turn it up the volume. The AirPods doesn’t come with buttons for volume AirPods doesn’t have those voice speech to tell you your volume is too high or that you are low battery. It will only play a sound if your battery is low Traveling: it is portable and small Simple summary: Don’t get the regular AirPods if you are thinking about getting one. Pros are simply better. 4.1/5', \"I was amazed such a great sound come out from this small Ear Bug.  The Ear Tip test is very helpful. I wear hearing aids with just the Air Pods Pro I made a phone call to test it without my hearing aids.  Wow! I can hear clearly with just the Air Pods Pro. Took one Star out due to no volume control on the Air Pods Pro.  Without the volume control when connect to PC, TV and other non-Apple products is a pain. Bose Quiet Comfort 35 is the over the ears type and after watching TV a little while my ears getting warm. So I purchase Air Pods Pro for watching TV. I have Samsung TV 7 series and set multi volume output on so can control TV volume and Bose individually. Air Pods Pro does not have volume control on the ear buds and I can't turn up or down the volume on the Air Pods Pro. After I search the web and go through my Samsung TV setting to see how to adjust my Air Pods Volume.  Luckily after I tried few times and found a way to do it. I hope this will help Samsung TV owners If you have the multi volume output on, turn it off then Samsung Remote can control the Air Pods Pro volume. Once you set the desired volume level then turn the Multi Volume Output back on so your family member can control the TV volume. But if you want to change the Air Pods Volume and you have to go through the above steps again. Apple should put back volume control on the Air Pods in the future.\", 'I used to be the ‘golden ears’ for a small chain of high-fi stores. These headphones reveal more complexity in everything I listen to, I hear each instrument more clearly, they have a wide sound stage. Knowing I will use these even makes going to the gym something to look forward to ;-). All the reviews I have seen appear to have been written by people who want nothing more than loud booming bass... I want to hear each instrument, backup singer, and the choices of the recording engineers. Flabbergasted they are this good at least to me. Noise cancellation excellent. I have found some memory foam tips on e-bay that make the ear seal better for me. My only complaint is that these seem to need a stronger wi-fi signal to maintain connection than some wired ones I had. Very happy', \"When you spend over $200 for earbuds you expect topnotch reliability and service. After connecting these to my iPhone XR I thought I was in for some decent listening experiences. Right off the bat the audio was stuttering and cutting out on WiFi and Cellular. They are also disconnecting and reconnecting constantly. Same thing happens whether I'm listening to music or trying to make a call. After experiencing these issues for the first few days I was told that I would now have to take them to an authorized Apple service spot to have the repaired! Amazon should replace them immediately since I purchaed them from here. But, NO, I have to take time out of my day and during Pandemic restrictions and put myself in danger by taking them phyhsically to Apple! So Frustrating!\", 'I can personally attest to the noise cancellation in these being insane. My wife purchased them about a month ago, and since then we fight multiple times a day. It goes like this: I say something to her in the other room, nothing, I yell to the other room, nothing, I scream to her in the other room, nothing. At this point concerned I go into the room, only to see her, with these in her ears, blissfully unaware of my attempts to converse. Upset I wave my hands and already being at a 10/10, begin yelling at her as soon as the head phones are out. If this goes on I am going to start cheating on her in the other room, feeling confident that thanks to apples patented noise cancellation technology I could have over multiple suitors, and have them talk dirty to me through a megaphone without ever disturbing the love of my life in the least. Thanks Apple!', 'Please Keep in mind these are wireless earbuds, they will not have the tactical noise supression of great noise cancelling headsets. With that being said their noise cancellation is still pretty damn amazing. I have a very big property with a lot of lawn to mow. My commercial lawn mower is loud as all hell and I will be sitting on that for 5-6 hours during the summertime to mow my lawn each week. I have been using bluetooth shooting earpro to stop the noise and it has been stellar. So when purchasing my airpod pros I had to try out the noise cancellation. It suprisingly worked, but i did have to put the volume to full. I could stillhear the mower which is fine by me so I know how it is running but the fact that it was able to cancel out as much of the mower sound as it did. Another thing that It amazingly suppresed was the sound of my tractor that was moving around a pressure washer that was also turned on. So I just went on a huge rant about the noise cancellation but you also have the transperancy mode. These are fantastic for if you are working on multiple things but you need to keep your head on a swivle. I dont feel like writing more about them but TRUST ME so worth your money.', \"Absolutely LOVE these. Spent months trying to find alternatives so I wouldn't have to pay the price for these. Eventually I just bit the bullet. I am so happy I did. It's incredibly easy to switch between noise cancelling and transparency mode. It's honestly incredible how easy it is and how I can go from barely hearing anything to then heading everything in greater detail. It's exactly what I wanted. The music quality of course is great. Bass hits hard and I can hear every note. The biggest issue I had with other wireless headphones/earphones was the call quality was terrible on them all. I talk on the phone every day so that's honestly more important than the music quality. Well, no fears, it's great. No issues and everyone says I sound crystal clear. I has the first gen airpods and while they were great, they really, really hurt my ears after a few hours. Not with these! The ear tips that come on it work good, but the smaller ones were more comfortable for me and are honestly perfect. It's a little weird switching them out because you have to pull pretty hard on them, and I was worried I'd rip the plastic tip. That didn't happen thankfully, but that's definitely the only thing I don't like about these. All in all, stop reading reviews and just buy them. Don't wait months like I did buying others. Just get these. You won't regret it.\", 'I’m on my replacement set from Apple after complaining about crackling while using noise cancellation or transparency mode. The crackling still exists. Also, they don’t fit very well and are easily dislodged with a smile or laugh. I’m constantly adjusting and pushing them back in. My low sound quality rating reflects this, most of the time they’re half out of my ear canal. Lastly, Bluetooth connectivity can still be spotty, many times I have to dink around with them so they answer a call or switch to the other bud. For $240 I can’t help but feel ripped off. I see the price dropped but I’d strongly recommend reviewing or, if possible, trying other, cheaper options. I went straight for the Apple brand because “it will work perfectly with my iPhone!” Mistake. Oh and the clicking is not nearly as cool as the tapping for changing songs, etc.', \"I think these are excellent headphones, and if they work for your, you're going to adore them. But, if you are like me, you may find that the active noise cancellation (ANC) causes motion sickness. In my case, it's unfortunately truly profound. (I am not prone to motion sickness in other situations, including sailing.) I've used Bose QC15s (over-ear headphones) for years and never felt even a hint of sickness. So, if this happens to you, know that you are not alone. My guess is that it has to do with the sealed, pressurized ear canal, but I don't know; it could be something about the algorithm they use. It is particularly bad if I have them on and try to do something like read or work with something up close--just like reading makes a lot of people seasick on a boat. I did a little research and found that I am definitely not alone in this. It's a well known phenomenon to people who design ANC software, and apparently some scientists are researching the issue. But clearly it doesn't have this effect on most people. So, it's not obvious that this is a fault in the design; this could just be an unfortunate idiosyncrasy that some of us have. Let's hope researchers figure it out and can fix it soon. Speaking of unfortunate idiosyncrasies, I also find that none of the silicone cups fit my ears, so they fall out very easily, whereas I could do a full-scale Cirque du Soleil routine with the original AirPods in my ears and never lose one. I find that if I remove the cups, they fit quite nicely. Of course, this would make the ANC less effective, but since I can't use the ANC anyway, I suppose it's no real loss to me. I want to be clear that I don't think any of this is necessarily about bad design. They can't fit every ear and the motion sickness must not be that prevalent or there would be more mentions in the reviews (this isn't the only review that mentions it, by the way). As for the quality of the ANC, it's amazing for something that isn't covering your whole ear. And I think the transparency mode is pretty nifty, but I do think they could work on the sound filter for it. It seems to accentuate noise over voices. In fact, I think a singer's mode (voice monitor) would be a great feature for those of us who like singing. The transparency mode helps you hear yourself when you sing, so you don't sound like you can't carry a tune like classic headphones, but it clearly isn't optimized to monitor vocal frequencies over the background, so your voice sounds like it's being played back by an Edison phonograph somewhere in the distance.\", \"I got these after accidentally running my 1.0s through the wash. I have to say I'm really impressed with the fit of them, I actually always preferred the style of the earpods over regular silicone earbuds when apple first released them as they fit my ear really well and likewise the first airpods. But the pro s do fir really well and you need the plug style for noise cancellation; so not really a complaint, just something I took note of. I do miss the tapping of the original airpods to pause/play and what-have-you as opposed to the pressing input of the pros as it makes it a little easier to drag out of your ear especially if you're using them while you exercise which I do a lot, on the flip side though its harder to accidentally press them than it was on the originals. The noise cancellation is great, obviously not as good as on high end headphones and such but really great for being wireless earbuds. So overall I really like them but there are a few complaints. For one the battery life really isn't too good, its better using them in regular mode without transparency or noise cancellation as with either of those modes you will have about half of your maximum battery life it seems. And second the PRICE holy smokes I don't really know how I convinced myself to spend $240 on wireless earbuds, I heard those Raycon ones that every youtuber advertises aren't really that bad. Anyways I just gotta say it: these things are overpriced as hell, I'm not even an apple snob, so who knows why I bought it, $140 for the 1s is already pretty steep but whatever that's apple I guess. That being said if you're just a huge fan of apple products or just really want the brand names, or just have extra money to blow then yeah they're great but if you're not seriously just skip these they are way too expensive.\", 'Where else would they squeeze their margins- they are at the point of cutting quality control which they sorely need. I’m disappointed to open a sealed box from Apple, a luxury brand, to find that the case is wobbling and the earbuds are misaligned where it was glued/bonded with dirt already trapped inside. The sound is improved due to insulation and the noise cancellation is impressive for what they are- small earbuds. However, I expect more for this price point from from an “elite” brand. Apple was once my favorite brand for all things they produce, and now all things have been gradually going down hill. These hit a breaking point where I will be returning them.', \"When I was looking at the Airpods, I really wanted these because of the noise canceling feature but really didn't want to pay $200 for them so I was going to settle for the regular Airpods. On the day I was going to order the regular Airpods, I saw that the Pro was on sale at the price of the regular so I got them. I am very happy with these Airpods. The sound quality is pretty good considering how small they are. The noise canceling is really nice. I've used them for more than 3 hours of listening to music and they were still going, I'm not sure how much charge was left because I didn't look but after you put them back in the case, the case recharges them. As we all know, everything Apple is ridiculously over priced but I think that even for $200, these are worth it.\", \"Quick Summary - The microphones are great on these for calls in noisy environments. The sound quality is good and they get plenty loud. Overall I'm impressed. Seems like Apple got all the basics covered very well. These are 90% at everything, and 100% at microphone. There's room for other headphones to do better on sound quality, battery life, etc. but Apple made a great set of headphones that puts everything together very well. More details... I watched a lot of YouTube reviews and read a lot of reviews on numerous true wireless headphones. I wanted a set that I could use to make calls in a noisy environment. I finally found a good YouTube video where someone wore several on the corner of a busy street while speaking with the headphones on. The Airpod Pros sounded head and shoulders above the others. I thought it may be bogus because I found little mentioned about this noticeable difference. I finally chose the Airpod Pros and immediately tried them out. My friends and family say my voice is very clear when I'm on a call. I even went so far as driving with the windows open at 40-60mph while on the phone. At those speeds they could hear the wind slightly, but my voice was still very clear. These are what I wanted. Sound quality - they get plenty loud, and sound just fine. These are not $40 cheap headphones. I am sure there are better sounding true wireless headphones though. Noise Cancelling - Everybody raves about how quiet these are, and they're right. They eliminate noise you don't ever realize is there. And they do a good job of canceling lower frequency noise too. The transparent mode isn't perfect, but it's 95%; very nice. Battery life - seems good so far. Case - it's pretty small, so that's nice. Overall, I'm digging these. I won't be using them all the time, so I'm sure they'll be great for a long time.\", 'So far I have not found any cons but I have only had them for 2 days. They have, however, been in my ears since then and I did find that they were so comfortable I forgot they were in my ears save for the fact that that sweet sounds were filling my head. In regards to the sounds provided by the earbuds, I found the music extremely clear and the rendering of the different instruments precisely distinct. The first night I fell sleep listening to music and when I awoke in the AM they were still in my ears while they were saying that they needed to be recharged. But they were still in my ears.  All other ear buds I have tested fell from my ears resulting in my having to search the bedding in the morning. I highly recommend the Apple earbuds pro to anyone interested in earbuds.', 'I received my new AirPods Pro in early May. I literally use them every day throughout the day and quickly fell in love with them. After almost 3 months, I was out on my morning 3 mile run with noise cancellation on. Out of nowhere the left ear piece started to have a lot of distortion and a VERY LOUD & high-pitched squawk started.  I have never had a sound hurt my ear so bad. Shortly after I was examining them and performing a reset. Somehow I formed a seal with my thumb over the ear tip and sweat that had dripped in the top vent of the left AirPod started to literally pump out. I could no longer use the left AirPod unless I have transparency & noise cancellation turned off. I contacted Apple Support as Apple stores close to me are still closed due to COVID. Apple is sending me a new left AirPod Pro but it took a lot of going back & forth with their support team. These are still my favorite but do not think I will be using them for when I exercise or do anything that induces dripping sweat.', 'I am so glad I got these. Especially during quarantine. They have helped me just enjoy daily tasks so much more. I debated these for a long time. I thought about getting the original AirPods but now feel the pros were completely worth it, especially due to the noise cancellation and transparent sound features. The good: Stay in my ears really well. I’ve owned other brands of Bluetooth headphones and had a problem where they would fall out on runs occasionally. I’ve run several dozen times with these and taken countless long walks with my dogs and never had the AirPod pros come out. Good: Sound quality is unmatched. The transparency mode is super helpful when I walk or run on busier sidewalks so I can hear someone coming up behind me. The noise cancellation seems like magic. I can listen to podcasts while running a bath and the loud running water sound does not at all come through. Phone convos come through clear, too. More good: comfort! Other ear buds have made my inner ear hurt. I think my inner ears are small. But these don’t hurt me even when I wear them for hours. I will wear them while cooking, walking the dogs, and then doing other chores around the house and they never make my ears sore. The bad: the $$ of course was a little hard to swallow. But ultimately I think it was totally worth it. I use them daily sometimes for hours at a time and they are comfortable, functional, and sound awesome. Kind of bad: they fell out when I went upside down. I tried to wear them doing a home yoga video but when I had my head upside down in some poses they did come out. But honestly, that wasn’t that surprising.', 'Wow these are incredibly good sounding earphones! I have bought several pairs of wireless headphones over the past 2 years and and haven’t been satisfied until now. Apple AirPods Pro are the perfect size and shape for a comfortable fit and long wear that lasts all day. The charging case is great because it’s basically like having 3 extra charges.  I use these for work snd school and when I sleep.  The noise cancelling is a 4/5 for me because I still hear ambient noise, even when then noise cancelling feature is activated.  The battery lasts 4 hours and is a 5/5. They come with 3 different sized ear molds that literally “click” into place.  I have small ear openings so the smallest size fits the most comfortably.  These are incredibly light and comfortable and I often forget they are in until someone breaks my attention.  I recommend these 100%.  Stop trying to make the cheaper brands work and just upgrade and treat yo’self!', 'I have never spent this much money on a pair of headphones before, so with the high price tag I expect them to be far superior to any other pair of headphones I\\'ve owned. Unfortunately that is not the case. The sound quality is pretty good and the noise cancellation/active listening features are pretty cool, but they keep popping out of my ears, especially when moving my mouth when chewing or yawning or talking. I\\'ll feel them start to slip out gradually until they just pop out. I\\'ve tried all the different sizes, but I have the issue with all of them. I end up having to just hold them in my ears with my hands to prevent them from falling out every few minutes. I googled it thinking there must be some way to fix it, and I came across so many others complaining about the same thing. I saw one post on the apple website from someone with the exact same problem, and saw that over 1,200 people had clicked the button \"I have this problem too\". I would not recommend and I wish I could return them and get my money back. Definitely not worth the high price tag, I love Apple but I am really regretting this purchase.', 'After waiting for the right price to purchase these very expensive airpods which I have had less than a month I can say the fit is great. I like included in the box were different size rubber ear pieces that give you a good snug fit. I also like that the charger does keep the air pods charged and I have been using them around 3-4 hours a day with good battery life.  I also have the Beats Pro (over the head) and those still hold battery life better than the air pods.  About the noise cancelling.. that feature is very great. I have been in a loud bar with people talking, yelling and a juke box going on and I can put in the air pods and choose noise cancelling and all around me is muted.  I love it that happens to be my favorite feature.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves music and movies as much as I do since the sound is very awesome. On a side note:  I purchased the Air pods about 2 weeks ago at the price of $249.00 plus tax. On Amazon Prime Day they were priced at $199.00 a significant price difference. I called Amazon to see if a price adjustment could be done and was told it was not possible since they do not price adjust with the competitor.  I advised that i was not trying to send back the product to purchase from a competitor but was looking for assistance thru Amazon since that is where the drop in price is and where I purchased the product.  I as advised to submit my request online but that they do not price adjust.  I feel as a consumer with pennies being tight due to the ongoing pandemic that Amazon would be of more assistance with my request.  The Air Pods are an expensive item and it took me some time to make the decision to purchase them and yes pricing was a factor. So as a consumer I would just like to say to make sure you check all around before purchasing them from Amazon. Amazon might have them in stock and you might even have the product within a few days but when it comes to helping the consumer out with cost I would of rather purchased hem somewhere else.', \"Let me just get it out there - my ears are apparently shaped weird or something. Most earbuds cause me intense pain, and I have tried many. Even over-ear headsets cause issues because my outer ear presses against the inside screen. Earbuds have been a complete no-go for me. When apple came out with the earpods years back, I felt like crying with joy because it was the first earbud that didn't completely kill my ear. So they have worked fine for me since then, except for 1) no wireless, and 2) no noise cancellation. I'm doing a lot of yard work right now, and wanted something that was sweat-tolerant, had good noise cancellation, and was wireless but would stay in the ear. I read hundreds of reviews and comparisons and these Airpods Pro seemed to be the right choice, except for one little detail - that extra little in-ear insert piece... the same kind of thing that had caused me so many issues through the years. But, if I wanted noise cancellation it was going to be the price to pay no matter what, so I gave it a shot to see if they'd work for me. The first day, I was able to wear for about 1.5 hours before my ears couldn't take it. The second day, about 2. And after that, I can wear them as much as I want. I can't tell you how happy that makes me. I've wasted an inordinate amount of time in my life on the stupid consideration of the shape and form factor of headphones, something I literally couldn't care less about except for the fact I'll experience pain if I don't consider those things. So, needless to say I'm thrilled about this. Everything works the way other reviews say. Easy and painless to use, and noise cancellation works great - it makes my lawn mower turn into a small hum and I can easily hear audiobooks at medium-high volume over it. I get sweaty and they stay in my ears just fine and keep on working. Battery life is great, and tossing it on the wireless charger is so easy. Super happy with these and while I hate dropping so much money on accessories, it has already made my life a bit happier. Money can't buy happiness, but it can sure buy earbuds that solve some problems and add entertainment value to work time without causing extra pain!\", \"Using the application built into your iPhone to be sure you've got the right size tips is critical to how much you will like these Pro's.  The application is easy to use and is even specific to each ear. I had the wrong tip at first, and almost returned them thinking the sound was tinny and weak, and that the noise cancellation wasn't worth much. With the correct tips installed, suddenly the sound was very good even with the noise cancellation off.  It was clear and had good bass. Then I turned on the noise cancellation and was really impressed!  It doesn't filter out everything, nor should it, but it makes a significant difference -- even if you're not playing music.  Even outside in the wind, you can hear the nuances of the music without cranking the volume like I had to with my old Airpods.\", 'So, I moved up to these from the first-gen AirPods that I’ve had for two years. And I’ve got to say that, for the price, this is the first disappointing Apple product I’ve ever bought. But first, the pros: The stems are smaller and less goofy-looking than my old ones. These give you more payback controls than the old AirPods: you can use “hey Siri”, pause, skip, and restart tracks from each bud, as well as switch between noise cancellation, transparency, & “off” modes. You just can’t control the volume from the buds themselves without using Siri. These are supposed to have better sound quality than regular airpods, but I didn’t notice a dramatic improvement. These are supposed to maintain a more solid, reliable connection to your iPhone due to the newer chip, and so far they have. These fit better and actually stay in your ears during movement and exercise, unlike my old ones. And these charge wirelessly, which is always a plus. These also have an excellent transparency mode that allows you to hear outside noises to make you more aware of your surroundings, and they’re more sweat/waterproof than the originals. Oh, and they come with a lightning to USB-C cable, which is very forward-thinking of Apple. But here’s the rub: The main reason a person spends about $100 more on these vs regular AirPods is for the active noise cancellation feature. And I’m just not very impressed by the performance here. Sure, it mostly drowns out “dull roar” background noises like running fans, car engines, or the A/C, but it doesn’t really drown out the tv, people talking, vacuum cleaners, or lawnmowers. I am so disappointed by this! Then I read in Apple forums that the Pros used to have great noise cancellation, but it was ruined by a firmware update! So, I’m still holding out hope that the cancellation will improve through a future firmware or iOS update. And hopefully, Apple will reverse course on its one-size-fits-all approach to noise cancellation. Because if I could really crank up this feature, I would. I primarily want to be able to use it while mowing and vacuuming, so I don’t have to turn up my music to dangerously high levels just to hear it. And your iPhone has a noise test you can do to make sure you’re using the right tip size for each ear (there are three sizes), but every size passes the seal test in both my ears, so this test is kind of worthless, in my opinion! In summary, I regret spending so much on these for a feature that’s all hype and underwhelming :(', 'I like my AirPods Pro—when they work. I have had repeated problems with one of them not charging when in the case. I would go to use them and one would be dead. I had one AirPod and one charging case replaced. Troubleshooting by the Apple store is an exercise in frustration because they only replace one part at a time (i.e. right AirPod, left AirPod, or charging case—but not all three!). So you will likely have multiple visits to solve your issue. And this was before I started working out in them. Stuck at home with the pandemic, I decided to start using the AirPods when I worked out on my Peloton bike. Worked great, for a while at least. But then one AirPod wouldn’t charge again. I looked in the case and it looked like the pins for charging had become corroded. Apple claims the AirPods are sweat-prooof. And I guess they are! But guess what, this doesn’t apply to the charging case! Apple even has a footnote on its website stating this. I took mine to the Apple Store and they wouldn’t replace the charging case and I had to BUY a new one. Bottom line: lots of charging issues in my experience and if you work out with them, make darn sure you wipe off of your AirPods afterwards to remove any sweat which will ultimately corrode the leads in the charging case and prevent recharging.', \"I’m not buying this product for the first time, I bought it in an Apple store before. Everything is normal, but here, my friend and I bought three altogether, and they all have the same problem. The battery of the charging box is seriously insufficient. For the same use time, my previous product can only be charged once a week or even longer. Electricity, and if you buy it here, the electricity will be completely exhausted in up to three days. The last thing I regret is that I bought the first Apple product that I was very disappointed in in order to save $50. I understand that the products I bought here are all defective products.Not only the battery problem, but also the problem with the microphone on the left earphone. When talking on the phone, the other party can't hear me clearly. I need to shout loudly before the other party hears it vaguely.\", 'The Apple AirPod Pro is an awesome set of ear buds. The noise cancellation blew me away. It was weird at first, no sound coming in! Then I played some music and the sound quality was great. Good bass response and highs were crisp. The AirPods let you allow sound from outside pass through by pressing on the stem and holding it for a second or two. I’m telling you, you just have to experience the sound from these things. As far as battery life, it’s pretty good. I watched a couple of videos for about an hour and was down to about 78%. The charging case can recharge you a few times before it needs recharging. Oh, and the case can recharge wirelessly if you have a QI pad. I can even lay my case on an Apple MagSafe charger and use it to charge.  The AirPod Pro fits snugly in your ear so they are great for running or whatever exercise you do. It even come with different size ear tips because not everyone has the same size ear canal. I was hesitant at first on the price, but once I got them, I was glad. Hope this helps you!', \"I lost my 2nd gen AirPods. I had resisted buy the AirPods Pro, because my AirPods were working fine for the most part. Yes, I sometimes had feed back and a weird sound going from one ear to the next, but I listen to news and books, not music, so it was fine. But, like I said, I lost them. The 'Find My' app said they were in my apartment complex, but I figured they had dropped out of my pocket on my way to my car and someone had picked them up and were enjoying them. After a month of not finding them and looking everywhere I finally accepted they were gone forever and bought the AirPods Pro. Honestly, at first, I wasn't impressed. I really didn't see much difference in the first few hours. I tried the transparency mode and noise canceling mode and it seemed like there was virtually no difference. Oh, well, I thought, I'll keep them a few days and see if they grow on me and if they don't I'll send them back and buy the cheaper 2nd gen again. Then later that day I was listening to them and was going to blow-dry my hair and was about to take them out, because I can never hear a thing when blowing my hair dry with my 2nd get AirPods, but decided to leave them in. I was amazed that I was able to hear clearly! I went back and forth between transparency and noise cancelation and the difference was amazing! It was the same when vacuuming. My car has a fabulous, high end Harman Kardon stereo system, but I actually prefer to keep my AirPods Pro in my ears while driving instead, now. Two days...just two days...after receiving my AirPods Pro I found my 2nd gen AirPods. So, really, I can't afford to keep these. I was happy enough with the 2nd gen AirPods. I should send these AirPod Pros back. But I'm not going to. I can't go back. It's not just the noise cancellation, but the sound quality is just so much better. The fit is awesome, too. I wasn't sure at first, but now I find I have to put my hands to my ears to remember if they are in my ears or not. And they do NOT fall out! They recharge amazingly fast, too. Not sure what I'm going to do with my 2nd gen AirPods, but I'm not giving up my AirPods Pros!\", 'First want to start by disclosing that I rated this 2 stars because it came with scratches.  When you pay so much for a product you expect to receive it brand new in top quality.  I was disappointed it wasn\\'t that.  But I didn\\'t return it because functionally, these bad boys are freaking amazing.  The noise cancelling gets me in a hyper focus state.  It\\'s an awesome feeling when it wraps you into a noise insulated reality.  Although it is a significant difference, it does not block all the noise.  It does a great job on blocking out \"noise\" but higher pitch sounds still come through.  The transparency mode is very useful too. When you turn these features \"off\" there is a noticeable difference between transparency and off.  But what I love most about this product is its vertical integration with other apple products.  Take an earbud off one ear and it pauses what was playing.  Put it back in the ear, and it resumes what it was playing.  Connected to your iPhone but want to broadcast sound from your Mac? Just click on the speaker icon on the top toolbar and select AirPods.  It quickly and seemingly connects, which is so nice departure from the lag you experience when trying to connect other bluetooth devices!', 'I have never used wireless ear buds before and I don’t know much about them. But Amazon had a sale so I went for it. I love that there are 3 sizes for the end piece and they have a test so you know you have the right size. I paired them once to my phone and iPad, and they automatically always are paired now. I also like that if I am watching a video and someone speaks to me I can just pull one out and it automatically pauses the video. When I put it back in, the video plays. They sound REALLY NICE!! Noise cancellation works really well, too. I really haven’t paid attention to how long the battery lasts though. They do feel pretty comfortable. You charge the case and when you put them in your device tells you what battery life is left. I used YouTube to show me how to use them. You tap to tell them what volume. I really love these and I keep them in my purse so I always have them around.', \"These fit me!  I have never had in-the-ear buds that work before.  The fit check is ingenious.  And the holder that recharges the buds works great.  The noise cancellation is about as good as non-over the ears headphones could ever be.  But the real star is the transparency mode.  A touch and hold of the stem turns off the noise cancellation so that I can hear other people talking.  And they are the first headphones that are (mostly) safe to walk along roads with them in.  However, if a person turns up the sound, then the pass through will not be enough to hear approaching cars.  Sound quality is very good, for these style of headphones, which means they are not as good as over the ear headphones and one should not expect them to be. It loses one star because:  1) This comes with a USB-C charger cord.  If you have a USB-A charger and a lightening connector, you can use that instead but a USB-C to USB-A adapter would have been nice.  2) The pass through of the outside noise - the level is not adjustable.  I cannot hear well enough to make me feel completely comfortable while walking.  3) They do fit well, and I am slowly overcoming my fear that they will fall out.  Still, after about 30 minutes of mowing the lawn, I feel like I need to push them back in. 4) They give a battery indicator when first connecting to the iPhone.  But if I don't have my iPhone out when this happens, I cannot easily tell what the remaining battery life is of the charger case.  5) Apple has stopped providing a user manual, even online.  I want to go one place and read how to use it.  Going to Apple's website provides a scattered amount of information.  I get frustrated with each new Apple product until I can figure it out.  This would be easily remedied. Overall, extremely well done Apple.  What makes this work is the superior fit, noise cancellation with the option of passing through the outside sound, and the great charger / storage case.\", 'I love my AirPod pros. The sound quality is better than any headphones I’ve ever. The ease of use is so nice as well because all I have to do is take them out of the case and put them in my ears and play my music. I don’t know if it’s something with the technology but my ears don’t get nearly as tired listening to music through the AirPods than usual. I can go hours with no strain on my ears. The noise cancellation is amazing. I use them for WFH and my neighbors are pretty loud mowing their lawns and kids screaming but all I have to do is put in my AirPods and turn on the active noise cancellation. When the noise cancellation is off I can hear my surroundings way better than regular headphones. I am able to hold a conversation while softly listening to music with my AirPods in. I’ve never had an issue with the battery. Finally, they’re great for running. I never have adjust them while I run and the sound quality remains spectacular', 'I got these because they were on sale for $179 and I have to dictate into an iPad, so having compatible earbuds will make things easier. I ordered the Bose QC Earbuds on the same day, so comparison is pretty easy. Sound quality: sorry Apple fanboys, but the quality on the Airpod Pros is a joke. Bass is trash. Overall quality is unimpressive. Bose QC Earbuds (well, *any* Bose headphones, really) blow these out of the water Noise-cancellation: I would describe the Airpod Pros more as \"noise-dampening\" than \"noise-cancelling.\" Again, Bose is far superior, though this is pretty universally known already Battery life: have not had long enough to say Long story short, the Airpod Pros are fine for conversations, dictations, and the like, and the noise-dampening is ok, but I would not recommend them for any music listening', 'The initial product that I received was defective. First, I thought it was just a software glitch but I soon realized that it was a hardware issue. To begin, the pairing was erratic from the beginning but I was able to pair it nonetheless. But the experience became more and more annoying unlike what Apple claimed. One in two occasions, the pairing will not work and when it does, the left side earbud simply doesn’t pair or when it does, it shows as “battery depleted” and quickly disconnects. To work around the issue, I followed the instruction to do a hard reset on the device. Sometime this solved the problem and other times it did not. This type of issues quickly becomes really annoying especially at the gym when you are ready to go and the $250 piece of product fails to work as intended. On the contrary, Galaxy buds and buds+ never had pairing issues, selective battery drainage/charge failure issues or random erratic failures with the left buds. At the end, the issues were resolved once I received a replacement - which, by the way, works well as intended with no major issues so far. Initial connection was smooth, there is no random pairing failure or one of the buds going out; however, the new, but moderately milder annoyance/issue is that when paired to my Apple Watch, as the song track changes, one of the earbuds volume becomes extremely low or no volume at all until I either change the volume up or down (which then corrects the volume disparity). This doesn’t happen all the time but I would say around 3 to 4 times in the 90min I was listening. I hope this is a software glitch that will be fixed with the firmware update. Now, the reasons I decided to keep and not move on to the competitor product: it works well with all Apple products (most of the time but not always), the sound quality is decent, the fit is good and comfortable and the noise cancelling function is better than what I expected. I just wish Apple was able to provide longer lasting battery life like...eh hem...buds+, especially this being their higher end product that demanded more $$$ than competitors. Airpods Pro is good but not great. The initial defective unit also left me with doubts about Apple’s quality control.', 'Do your research if you\\'ll be pairing these to an iPhone 11. Extremely annoying \"pop\" or click while using the \"Pods\" on phone calls. (Using the current as of this date iOS on the phone 14.4.2 / and the current firmware on the Pods 3A283) At first I thought it was just a \"bad\" pair I received. I of course did as Apple suggests, fully charged phone and pods, un-pair / re-pair, and all the rest. But still a very noticeable pop or click about every 15 - 90 seconds while on a phone call. So (thank you Amazon) I sent them back and requested a replacement. Replacement arrives, (needed to update the firmware on the Pods), paired up and pop pop pop, click click click. Soooo un-pari, reboot, fully charge, all the rest but pop continues. Soooo... My wife has an iPhone 12 with the SAME Pods. She does NOT have this problem. My (new) Pods on her phone NO pop. Her (older) Pods on my phone and YES a pop. Soooo.... Google around and come to find that there are many others with the same problem when using the AirPods Pro on an iPhone 11. Sooooo.... Until Apple can correct this, hopefully through software on the Phone 11, I\\'ve once again sent my SECOND pair back to Amazon and requested a refund. Do your homework or live with lousy sound with you $250 AirPods Pro', \"Noise cancellation = Awesome! Transparency = Awesome! Knocked off one star because you either have one or the other. I wish there was a way to just make them regular headphones. When in a windy situation like driving down the road with the window open, a gust of wind hitting your ear causes the headphone to attempt to counteract the noise it is detecting changes it's audio input that the headphone is running in parallel with the audio stream being played. The sound quality is not affected negatively except for a small drop in volume until it recovers but it's a bit irritating. UPDATE: I was shown that you can indeed put them in vanilla headphone mode. It’s in the headphone settings on the phone. Added the well deserved fifth star.\", \"After spending probably 6 hours reading reviews and buying 3 separate pairs of $40 garbage I got tired of buttons not even having full function and got the real thing. No going back.  AirPods PRO are the only way to go, and PowerBeats also have the Apple chip, but from what I've heard the AirPods PRO are a little better. Should have bought these a long time ago.  Good job Apple.  Longer battery life please!  8 hours would be nice... battery dies on me pretty regularly, and I even try to keep in charging case when not in use.  Like the induction charging case (a must w/ earbuds). Love the functionality on these... auto pause, solo mode, skip commercials on podcasts, ridiculous noise cancelation, excellent sound quality, perfect call quality and talk to text, etc... everything works perfectly and very intuitive... I don't have to even think about these things with the exception of the battery.  I tried several other pairs in the $40 range before buying these... wish I would have went straight to these, but still just a little room for improvement on the battery life... also, offering different colors would be an improvement. I'm pigmentally challenged, and this white still has too much light contrast for me.  I think I'd prefer black or dark gray, and I strongly feel the PowerBeats look way better on darker skin tones.\", 'I do not get paid to write this. Get rid of the people who receive free or get paid to write reviews and cell phone telemarketers and life would be better. I have not had these long enough to evaluate battery life but with all the features it is less of an issue. This is my fourth pair of different earbuds, so it is easier to know. Sony WF-1000XM3 kept falling out of my ear and the sound was very disappointing until the app turned on the equalizer. Watching $250 bounce on the floor was not fun. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 locked in my ear and the sound was ok. I only received a fraction of the advertised battery life. These do not advertise a very long battery life. The sound is just fine and the noise  canceling is one of the better ones.  The ease of connectivity and control is amazing compared to the other ones I tried. I bought a pair of Bose 700 headphones after I decided no matter what the manufactures made claims to earbuds can only sound so good. The reviews are glowing everywhere and rightfully so. I did not want to have the common earbuds so I tried others. These are comfortable enough.  I always use the smallest tips. With the prime day sale and extra features, sound, comfort, these are the go to when the earphones are too bulky.', \"Well, I didn’t want to spend $250!  So I tried the TOZO NC9 earbuds.  Okay, but for me the base sound was overdone.  Plus earbuds (tried them all) just didn’t do it for me. Saw the PROs listed for $199 so took leap off the financial cliff.  Have to admit the ANC and Transparency mode are vastly improved over what the NC9s we’re offering.  For my lifestyle the Transparency mode is FANTASTIC!!  I can now listen to my music or aa Audible book while taking my dog for a two mile hike w/o fear of the sneak bus attack.  I use this feature more than the ANC. These meet my needs perfectly! Gusto! ***UPDATE*** Changed my *STAR* rating from 5 to 4!  Reason:  No matter which ear tips I try they have all slipped out of my ears.  I have ordered some foam ear tips.  I really like these Airpod Pros and once I get the proper foam tips I expect I'll be happy moving forward. **** UPDATE 2 **** I ordered a set of the Comply foam tips.  Because of that purchase I’ve decided to keep my AirPod Pros.  Before the Comply tips arrived I was one “click” away from returning my Pros. **** UPDATE 3 **** Well, I executed that one click after having them for 5 weeks..  After many attempts verifying they were seated in the case left earbud gave up the ghost.  Returned for credit.  They were great when fully operational. Changed rating  - 3 STARS!\", \"Debated on spending the money for these.  My brother told me about a cheaper brand he'd bought, they were great, way less money, blah blah blah.  But I had already tried a cheaper version and they cut out and I had to return them.  Finally just buckled down and got these and LOVE THEM.  I love how I can open the case next to my iphone and a picture pops up telling me about battery life.  They were already hooked up to my phone - I didn't have to do anything (major plus for a non-techie like me).  I've had zero issues with them cutting out.  I typically use them when I'm mowing the lawn and listen to podcasts.  When I have the noise cancellation on, I CAN'T HEAR THE MOWER.  They're comfy, easy to put in, and I loooooooove not having the wire tethering me to the phone in my pocket when I'm  trying to mow.  No more getting tangled up when I grab the handle.  Never cuts out.  Sound is GREAT.  (Chucked my Bose for these.  Don't even miss them.)\", 'I just received mine, but plan to update this as time goes on. These are the best wireless ear buds I have ever purchased. I have owned Samsung phones & now own an Apple 11 Pro. I’ve owned cheap ear buds, Sony & Samsung. These are my first AirPods. One thing with Apple products, if you stick with Apple accessories you have less frustrations & issues. The AirPod Pros have excellent noise reduction. When I first used mine my daughter was talking to me, right in front of me. I could see her lips moving but could not hear a single sound. The noise reduction truly is amazing! Conversations I have had today have been very clear. No one has complained about not being able to hear or understand me. I’ve used these in my vehicle (for the first time the hands free in my vehicle did not cancel out my headset - Kudos to you AirPods!) conversations were great. I’ve used these outside around birds & a little wind, still no complaints while talking on the phone! Listening to music is impressive. I never knew tiny little AirPods could sound so loud, clear & concise. Apple always does an amazing job at making things easily connect & sync. I immediately was given tips & suggestions from Apple once I connected my new product & Siri works even better with these fantastic little buds. I am truly impressed and love these AirPods. I highly recommend them. I would also like to point out if you feel the buds that come with your phone or the AirPods 2 hurt your ears do not worry about these. These feel comfortable & fit like a glove. They come with three different bud sizes to attach. I have a small ear canal so I used the smallest one. I have not had an issue yet with them falling out. I plan to jog in the morning & will update how they stay in place through a workout.', 'AirPods Pro are really disappointing.  They do not pair consistently with ANY Apple products (I have an iPhone 11 Pro, a MacBook Pro and an 11 inch iPad Pro).  They drop calls regularly and unpair unexpectedly.  I have purchased two difference pairs (as Amazon will confirm) and both had precisely the same issues, including with a brand new $2800 MacBook Pro.  A very disappointing product, not worth the money.  I have been using a pair of $60 Plantronics headphones for Zoom and Webex video conferences, they are far more stable and listeners say they are much clearer.  DO NOT BUY.', \"The short review:  Although these earbuds sounded good to me and the noise cancellation was good, I'm still returning them.  They don't seem to fit properly with either the small or medium ear pieces and they are a bit large in the ear for sleeping, which is one of the main things I wanted them for.  I think they'd be great for the vast majority of people, they just didn't suit me. The longer review:  I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate music that sounds good.  I enjoy using headphones and hearing nuances in the music that I miss when listening on speakers.  However, the only time I use headphones are when walking, the occasional airplane trip, and for sleeping.  Yes, I'm one of those people who need sounds to sleep.  I don't use headphones every night, but when I'm bored with the TV I turn to my music to get sleep. For many years I used a set of cheap wired earbuds that worked fine.  The sound was good, they stayed put, and they didn't hurt my ears.  But there was no noise cancellation, which was a pain on an airplane and when I wore them to the gym, and the wire meant I had to wear my ipod in a holder on my arm which sometimes caused it to get rubbed by something and change the volume.  Not a pleasant thing while trying to sleep.  Finally, after more years than could be reasonably expected from a cheap pair of earbuds, they gave up the ghost. Since I got such good results with my original wired earbuds I ordered the exact same thing.  The fact that the price had dropped from $15 to $8 should've been a warning sign, but I ordered them anyway.  How far wrong can you go for $8?  Anyway, it appears the company has changed the way they're making these earbuds and the sound was awful. So I decided it was time to join the 21st century and get a pair of wireless earbuds.  Besides, being stuck in the house for several weeks due to COVID meant I was craving a new toy.  And I saved a bunch of money by cancelling 2 cruises so the $240 price of these wasn't that bad of a shock.  After much research and reading I ended up ordering these AirPod Pros. They arrived quickly and I immediately opened them, paired them to my ipod, and spent a while listening to music while I read a book and my husband had the TV on.  The sound quality was really good (remember, I'm not an audiophile and YMMV) and the noise cancellation was unlike anything I'd ever experienced (in a good way!).  After a half hour or so my ears started to feel a bit sore so I changed out the default medium-sized earpieces for the smaller ones.  The sound quality and noise cancellation wasn't quite as good with those, and I tried shuffling through the various settings (sometimes by accident because the button is easy to hit when you're adjusting the earbuds) and finally got it to where it was acceptable.  I only wore them another half hour or so and they felt fine. The big test was when I wore them to bed.  It was great to leave the ipod on the nightstand and not worry about having it on my arm where I might accidentally turn up the volume if I roll over.  While laying on my back the earbuds didn't feel too bad, but I'm more of a side sleeper.  I've been sleeping with earbuds for years and can sleep on my side with one hand cupped over my ear to keep the earbud from smooshing up against the pillow, so I tried the same thing with these.  Unfortunately, because the earbuds themselves are larger than wired ones, to accommodate the wireless stuff I guess,  I just couldn't lay there without pressing on the earbuds and causing soreness in my ear.  I tried for a while and finally took them off. So I'm returning them.  The sound quality and noise cancellation are great, but they just never felt that comfortable in my ears and were a bit too big for sleeping.  I also don't think the battery would've lasted through the night, but at this point that's a minor detail.  I'll keep looking for something suitable and might just stick with wired ones.\", 'these are real airpods and everything apple says about them is true -- sound quality, battery life, squeezing the stems to pause, noise cancellation, whatever. but also: they are great for small ears. i am a full grown adult but have freaky small ears. i had the original airpods and they fit in my ears but would really really hurt if i wore them for a few hours -- to the point that i couldn\\'t put them back in the day after a 2 hour flight because my ears would be raw from them. so i had been using in ear headphones marketed to teenagers and they fit well but were small. these are great! they come with 3 different sized caps and the smallest fits me perfectly. no pain, no \"are they about to fall out of my head and be gone forever.\" so if anyone has ever looked at your ears and said \"can you hear with those things they are so small,\" these are the headphones for you', \"Long story short, these are the most versatile with greatest battery life and quality for the size that last forever alternating ears and charge or for whatever on the go with a small form factor battery case that you can charge how you want. Stop reading unless you are bored. I dragged my feet on this because, stupid me thought Bose, I mean Apple/Bose was getting ready to announce the new improved yada yada.. I have the big SoundSport Free of the ability to switch between ears or having two ears in a phone call or connect to my mac with both working. No, Bose came out with the new latest best in class noise cancelling with all the same flaws as the old one for only one connecting to device and the other ear being dependent on the right ear. That would have been awesome if they sold only one like the original bluetooth Bose that I replaced with SportFree of anything but really good sound when you don't move or need multiple device capabilities. Having the QC15 and then a nice third party QCBT15 wireless adapter. That is good for the sitting still and need to be quiet. Hope that helps\", 'Wow! Got a deal $199! Legit Apple ear buds. The sound is ok. I am use to my beats headphones which are much better. But this is nice for convenience and sounds fairly good. I look forward to the future upgrade. Could use more bass. A little uncomfortable after about 30 mins. I find I keep taking them out for a break. The airpods 2 were more comfortable. In fact you forget they are there. But the fit is not like these. These are better. Noise cancel is good as well as transparent which works really well! The spacial sound is amazing! But of course for now only works with Apple + I think and their very limited amount of shows. I am sure that will change eventually unless Apple decides they don’t want to play with other streaming companies. Lets hope that is not the case!', 'I’m in love with my new AirPods! I initially had some knock off cheap version just to get a feel if I’d like them. These amazingly sound just as good as the wired ones. The only downside is the listening time however I typically only listen to one bud at a time anyways with wired ones so I can really get 9 hours of listening with the wireless. Right out of the box with only 70% I was able to hold a FaceTime conversation for 2 hours with both buds in. I’m really impressed with the noise cancellation as well as transparency. With cancellation on I couldn’t hear my roommate talking to me at all. I thought she was messing with me by just moving her mouth. The transparency makes the AirPods sound a little cheap but really impressive how you can immediately hear people talking through music when you switch it on. Of course being an Apple product it integrates seamlessly with your iPhone. UPDATE: Still very much in love with my AirPods! I use them daily and I feel like I can’t go anywhere without them unlike my wired headphones that I only took to work. Battery: I get over 6 hours from each pod with the volume at 50% or lower. I work 5 hours before lunch, I use the AirPods that entire 5 hours and on lunch they’ll have about 30-40% charge. I charge them over lunch and they’re back to 100% for my last 5 hours. Durability: I’ve dropped the pods so many times and nothing has happened. The lid on the case doesn’t stay shut very well which sucks because it’s always opening in my pocket and I worry if I drop the case the pods will fling everywhere. So I bought a case for the case with a clasp as a solution and I love it. Sound: Sounds just like your classic Apple earbuds that everyone has used and loved for years. As for the noise cancellation oh man.. It’s quite stellar. I think people are mistaken by the word “cancellation” because they assume it cancels ALL noise. It actually just cancels out background noise and it’s quite fascinating which sounds it chooses to omit or not. For instance I can still hear myself typing, breathing, coworkers quietly chatting around me. What I can’t hear is the air conditioner that usually gives of a faint whirring noise, I can’t hear my footsteps which are usually pretty loud, I can’t hear the noise of paper as I flip through books.. It’s very strange but very cool, if it didn’t drain the battery I’d use it all the time. I think what it’s doing is trying to cancel most of the unnecessary sounds around you so you can focus on the important sounds. With the music up super loud though nearly all sounds are cancelled, it’s impressive but not practical for good battery life. Easy to use: Seamless setup then seamless connection. Dings to let you know it’s connected immediately. Switches between my watch and my phone seamlessly. Easy to clean and sanitize. Can you tell I love them? I prefer Apple products. They work really well and you definitely get what you pay for. I’m sure other brands sound great too and are more affordable or maybe have better features whatever, but Apples web of products work so well together and I prefer IOS so it just makes sense to stick with products that will link up perfectly to my phone.', \"Let me preface this by saying that I am NOT an Apple fanboy. For the last few years, I've only used iPad Pro - no iPhone or other iThing. This is my first set of AirPods. I thought they were an overpriced status symbol (plus the guy at the home office who wore these all the time liked to brag about his basketball skills and make engine sounds with his mouth).  They were $50 cheaper on Amazon than Apple, and I had some points, so why not? Wow! These are surprisingly good! The noise cancellation is impressive. It was surreal working out at a noisy gym today and not hearing the music or pounding footsteps on the treadmills, or anything but my iPad sound. Turning that off or enabling transparency mode allows me to hear everything.  Until these, I've never had noise cancelling headphones that worked.  So that said, don't use noise cancellation where there might be traffic, wild animals, etc. They are quit expensive, but I'm only rating quality here and not reducing the rating for the price.\", 'I absolutely love the sound qualities that the Airpods Pro carry, however, there are some minor of not major problems and complications that you MAY experience. For one, I’ve had these Airpods for two months now, and having worn these for a while, i didn’t take notice that my ear would be allergic to the silicone tips, and like most people, it’s would itch. Most people’s first instinctive reaction would be to scratch the itch in your ear, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DO THAT, if you’re worried about this, it’s recommended you buy memory foam or alternative material that’s NOT silicone (I Highly recommend the brand “Comply”.) problems like these can cause infections or clogged ears (like in my case.);having these would set my rating on these back a little. Other than that, the only other problem is having them fall out a bit too easily. When i’m at the gym, i like to wear my Airpods, like anyone else, sometimes they tend to fall out, and again, it would have to be the design of the silicone tips, and i highly recommend you buy alternative tips for yours. Unfortunately you’ll always have flaws in any product you buy. Having these are convenient but also troublesome overtime. Having said this, i would still vouch for these Airpods if you’re looking for great quality, convenience, and overall a nice experience.', \"I had the 2019 air pods and some Bose noise cancelling headphones.  These air pod pros fit in my ear canal well. They don't hurt my ear after a while. The noise cancelling is excellent. I turn them off when somebody needs to talk to me in a loud environment (e.g. Starbucks) by just short holding one of the tips. The difference is noticeable. I like how you can pause and unpause.  The sound quality is really good but not as good as over the ear noise cancelling headphones which I expected. I do wish there was more functionality for phone calls such as mute/unmute and hangup.\", \"I almost feel guilty leaving such a poor rating for a brilliant piece of engineering, however the Airpods Pro failed for me in several ways. They've now been relegated to exclusive use for voice calls and nothing else: * Noise cancelling is uncomfortable. Hard to articulate exactly how, but my brain knows something isn't quite right and I feel dizzy within seconds of activating it. I can't personally speak to other in ear noise cancelling headphones, but it's nothing like the noise cancelling I've experienced from on ear headphones, which has been nothing but been pleasant. * Airpods frequently stop working. Left or right Airpod will stop connecting via Bluetooth and require a hard reset. This happens about once a week, and while it's easy to fix, it's annoying. * Audio sync delay. There is very often a delay between the right and left ear. It's mostly not noticeable when listening to content driven by my phone, but often noticeable even on a relatively new Macbook Pro. When driven by an older Macbook, Airpods are almost always out of sync. I'm surprised this is possible, give the processing presumably occurs on the Airpods themselves, which are communicating with each other, but it's a very obvious trend. I often have to take one Airpod out and listen with just one ear * Airpod ear fit is fine not amazing. Falls out occasionally while at the gym, but generally okay while walking or running All of the benefits of the Pro were drawbacks, so I'd go with the standard model, or explore something else altogether. When not concerned with audio quality, my $10 wired earphones do just fine, and never have sync, bluetooth, or fit issues.\", \"When they were first introduced I wasn't a big fan of the sound quality or the way they looked. Personally I was never a big fan of the bigger stem that the previous airpods had. Now with the Pros I really like the more premium/slim look they have going for them. When it comes to sound these won't blow you away, but once you turn on ANC they're a different headphone. It feels like the bass is more punchy and overall everything sounds cleaner. A much bigger improvement over the previous generations. There's also a transparency mode. I love it. I can have these on at work and still hear the work phone/ coworkers if need be. The battery life in general for most buds still needs work, but the charging case does wonders. I'll typically get about 4ish hours of sound and then put them in the charging case. I leave work at 4:30 and decided to put them in to charge at 4:13. When I left they went from 0-73% so I was really impressed by the fast charging. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and even though the price tag is high(like most Apple products) I feel I can justify it with how premium this feels.\", 'The design of these headphones is very well thought out. The noise cancelling is fantastic, the overall sound is great, and the spatial audio is a great concept but I think it eventually will be improved. The new controls take some getting used to if you’re coming from gen 1 or gen 2 AirPods, but I think they are an improvement. The call quality is equal to the 1 and 2 but there is significant improvement for listening volume because of the seal that the tips create for noise cancellation. All of this does come at a cost. Apple was definitely thoughtful in including different sized ear tips, but the fact is that these will not fit everybody comfortably, especially if you enjoy the fit of the 1 and 2. For me, my ears started hurting after about an hour of wear, and I started getting a headache soon after. I ended up taking the tips off of the AirPods, which bought me a little extra pain-free time, but it still returned. *Update* I figured out that you can’t cram the AirPods into your ear. You just set them inside your ears. This makes a huge difference. While there is a little discomfort at the beginning, you do get used to the fit. The sound quality for earbuds is very good. The bass hits pretty nicely if you’re not looking for audiophile grade earbuds. Spatial audio is pretty awesome once you understand what it is and you can find videos that utilize it. Give these a shot but be prepared to spend a little time adjusting to them.', 'I’ve had these for a week now and I like them a lot. Prior to this I used a pair of wired Bose in-ear noise cancelling headphones. Of course I bought them right before Apple decided to get rid of the headphone jack but I paid a lot of money for them so I’ve been using them for a while and they work fine. I avoided buying the original AirPods for several reasons: I wasn’t convinced Bluetooth could offer the same sound quality as wired and would cut out too often. I was afraid they wouldn’t fit in my ears and would fall out and I would lose them or just not use them No noise cancelation. So then the AirPods Pro seemed to address all those issues. Bluetooth seemed ok according to friends and reviews. Better fit and different sized ear thingies. Added noise cancelation. So compared to my Bose headphone I would say these are better. Of course they are wireless which makes them more useful in general. They are very comfortable to wear for long periods while listening to music or on conference calls. So far they have stayed in my ears pretty well with no issues. If doing very strenuous activities I would be careful but I was able to do yard work no issues. Bluetooth signal seems good with no cutting out. Sound quality is better than I expected overall. As good as my wired Bose. The problem with the Bose is that when they aren’t in noise canceling mode they sounds like $10 headphones. Then flip on noise cancelation and they sound great. No in between. With these AirPods they sound good in any mode. Obviously better in noise cancelling but they sounds decent in any mode. I especially like the transparency mode. This allows you to actually hear some outside sounds. I’m just not comfortable in noise canceling mode all the time. Sometimes you need to hear traffic, etc. The one place Bose is better I in noise cancelation. Yes they block more sound than the AirPods but it’s not dramatic and the AirPods are better in most other respects. Yes battery life is not outstanding but they charge themselves when they are in their little cozy so it’s not that bad. Also no they aren’t cheap but it’s pretty easy to spend $250 on headphones these days. So far I would say I’m a happy customer.', 'I would give these 5 stars if not for the ridiculous price.  And I wouldn’t have purchased them if I didn’t have a $100 amazon gift card I was saving for a special occasion.  But I really couldn’t be happier with the product so far.  I spent a week reading every review online and watching reviews on YouTube. I was struggling with the price but I was also desperate for a quality ear bud.  I spent months trying various brands and then returning them.  Either didn’t fit comfortably or poor quality.  I wear these at work and at the gym.  Never longer then 3-4 hours without a break but no discomfort to report and they stay firmly in my ear.  One thing that could bother people is the bass level is average. I have zero problem with it. I don’t expect ear shaking bass on ear buds and frankly no one should. Sound quality for music and podcast is crystal clear and perfect for what I need.  Battery life is solid and charge quickly when needed. If these were $100 cheaper I would be screaming from my rooftop to purchase them.  Right now I tell everyone they’re great but over priced.  Really depends on how comfortable you feel spending the coin on a ear buds. I am a little paranoid carrying them around.  I feel like I’m transporting a gold bar and need to protect them with my life. Other positives I like are the ability to use only one and leave the other charging.  Noise cancellation and transparency have been nice.  Not earth shattering but again for ear buds you shouldn’t expect them to be but you will be pleasantly surprised. Also the syncing is fast which is hard to come by in some brands.  Really work seamlessly with the iPhone.', 'AirPods Pro review There are two types of noise-canceling I am talking about here. One type is canceling the noise so that my students cannot hear the background noise. This is the type of noise-canceling that I am interested in. Another type is canceling the noise so that I cannot hear the background noise. This is the type of noise-canceling that is good for listening to music. I teach community college on Zoom, and my students can hear the construction noise in my background because a new building is under construction next to my place. For my students, I bought Plantronic Voyager 5200 and AirPods Pro. My students can still hear some loud noise with AirPods Pro, but they can hear nothing except my voice from Plantronic. I bought several (MpowX3 with ANC, iTeknic, Enacfire E60 with ANC, Boltune BT-BH023 with ANC, Boltune BT-BH024 with CVC 8.0, TOZO NC9 with ANC) and recorded in my bathroom with the ventilation fan on, and in a quiet room with my cell phone music in the background. Pros: 1. Comfortable to wear for many hours 2. The second-best noise cancellation for listening to music (the best one for this type of noise cancellation is Boltune BT-BH023 with ANC) 3. The second-best cancellation of the background construction noise according to my students 4. The second-best cancellation of the noise from my bathroom ventilation fan according to my recording 5. Most stable connection with no interruption with my MacBook Pro and iPhone 6. No electronic noise when switching ANC on and off 7. The least distortion of my voice from the recording in the bathroom with a ventilation fan and ANC on Cons: 1. Cannot be found by “Find My” from my MacBook Pro and does not show up in “My Support” or “Apple ID” devices. After I paired with my iPhone, AirPods Pro showed up in “Find My” from both my MacBook Pro and iPhone. 2. Short battery life: a pair of fully charged earbuds can last 3.5 hours of talk time. 3. Relatively weak bass: these earbuds have the weakest bass in comparison to other earbuds under $60. 4. Can still hear the background construction noise and my cell phone music in the background with ANC on 5. The least distortion of my voice from the recording in the bathroom with ventilation fan and ANC on. 6. Expensive Overall: I am happy and satisfied with this purchase. For teaching on Zoom, I use Plantronic Voyager 5200. For listening to music, I use AirPods Pro. I rank AirPods Pro as the best TWS earbuds. The second-best are Boltune BT-BH023 with ANC and MpowX3 with ANC. Plantronic Voyager 5200 is the best for talking, i.e., canceling noise for the audience. I am looking forward to the 3D surround sound of AirPods Pro in the future update.', \"I got these for my wife so she wouldn't keep asking for my noise cancelling headphones when we travel and they are great! I know this is going to read like a fake review, because we all know what those read like, but these things are truly great! The sound quality is great, the noise cancelling is good as well. I'm sure you could get better NC with a different product, but these were great for general use. They also pair and turn on automatically when you open to case, which is great. The only thing I hate about them is the battery life and lack of volume control. They can last for a whole day on standby/light listening, but if you use them for calls, they'll die inside of an hour before needing more juice from the case. The stems also have controls for skip, back, play/pause, siri, but no option for volume. That's crazy to me! I hope apple adds this as an option in a future update, but for now, volume has to be changed on the phone (or a paired apple watch if you have one). Great product!\", 'These were an upgrade for my husband who is a devout Apple fan. We both had the previous generation (not pro). These are night and day in comparison to the older model. They completely cancel out outside noise which is an absolute must while working from home during the pandemic. If you’ve ever tried to conference call your boss while your kids fought over the last pancake, then you know what I mean. Not only will you not hear them, but you won’t hear your wife yell at you from across the room either. Husband says they have changed our marriage. Sound quality is impeccable. Noise cancellation 10/10. Battery life is a considerable upgrade when compared to the 1st generations. Treat yourself. Can’t imagine our lives without these.', \"Quick review after owning airpods pro for ~17 months. Sound quality and noise cancellation was impressive, and they stayed in ear even during heavy workouts. After 6mo+ I started noticing sound quality differences between right & left pods, and started getting headache inducing whoosh and humming noise whenever noise cancelling was on. Turns out that the left bud was malfunctioning, 8 months after purchasing I had to send it for a replacement. Apple ultimately replaced the left pod free of charge after inspecting it to confirm it wasn't due to exterior damage. 2 weeks ago (16 months since original purchase), the right pod has same issue, unable to maintain noise control and loud humming noises. Without service coverage, I would have to send it for repair, so I paid $250 for a device that didn't last 1.5years. I've only used these airpods during workout, for a total of ~5hours of playtime per week.\", \"I love them but they are INFURIATING sometimes: - definitely don't expect standard AirPods battery life.  Of course, but worth mentioning. - if they are out of my ears but not in their case, it takes nothing for them to stay connected.  If you notice you're missing calls and texts, there is the likely culprit.  I took a call once with my AirPod Pros sitting on the desk, after 15-30 seconds, my phone kicked over to them on the desk and I lost audio. - sometimes, when you put them in your ear, only one AirPod would work.  No amount of shifting and trying will get the other to connect.  You have to reseat them in the charging case to get it to wake up.  I often move around and leave the case in my office.  I'm calling this a PIA. - the electronic audio pass through is fine but it's not natural.  No real gripe but it's tough to keep these in while you work if that is what you have been doing with the standard AirPods. Love the audio.  Love the noise cancelling.  Love AirPods.  These, not perfect. Happy Holidays!\", \"I held off purchasing bluetooth earbuds until I was forced to by my iPhone 12. I researched several on paper and by others reviews. I found as you might that other peoples reviews only go so far since it is a very subjective world. The Apple AirPod Pro's are an adequate device for listening to music where elevators fail to employ. How anyone can call these high in quality is beyond my ear. Obviously they don't mind having their music mashed and clipped to the point of almost indescribable flatness by bluetooth. That aside, the sound is fine for short periods, but I think any of the competitors would be fine as well. The noise cancellation is good and works well in a city environment. I usually have both augments turned off. Battery life works well for my usage, but i you have these glued to your ears all day, well then it is not going to make it with ANC on. I would suggest to find the best earbud that matches your music device. So, Apple works best with Apple.\", 'I bought these to be able to hear music and answer my phone while on tractors and mowers. I have used the previous version of these for several years, and one of the younger ranch hands (same one who got me to but the old ones) had a pair of these that have noise canceling on em and told me how well they work. I decided to get me a pie and try em as well. They work great!! I can use the noise canceling option on tractors and mowers and not be half deaf by the end of the day. I tried em while mowing with my 60 inch zero turn, and the engine noise was just a soft hum in the background. They are awesome! In know there is probably a ton of other stuff they do, but I don’t much care, they save my hearing (and sanity) when sitting on tractors all dang day.', \"These are great headphones save for the fact that I have different sizes of my ear canals on different sides of my head. So, one of them doesn't fit quite right and kept slipping out. I purchased some holders that would keep them around my neck but, they blocked the microphone so, people couldn't hear me well, when they were worn. The base on it isn't all that well. For the money, I expected a broader range of sound but, it is what it is. Would I buy them again...no. I have bought them 2x and both times lost one of them. (expensive because that equals $200 for the loss) over $400 for the overall purchase of 2 sets. So, I bought the iPod Max (over the ear headphones) now, these are weighted and I don't have to worry about how that fit in the ear canal. Yes, also expensive but, hey, what's NOT expensive when it comes to APPLE?\", 'I’m calling this 3 stars but if they worked, they’d be 5 stars all the time! They pair easily, sound great, have really good noise cancellation, and the fit is comfy and they stay in my ears. Problem is they hardly ever work! I just sent these in to Apple Support FOR THE 3rd TIME! First time the case malfunctioned and wouldn’t charge the AirPods. Second time, one of the AirPods stopped working. Now one of the pods was all static and the other stopped being recognized by the case, so it wouldn’t charge or even register as being there. Hoping I get my 5 start pair in exchange!', 'Typically I do not like ear buds, they always end up hurting my ears and I have to remove them. I tried the Air Pod Pros (after specifically reading that they were comfortable) and I am not disappointed. They are fantastic! They come with different size covers so you figure out which one fits best by doing a sound fit test. The noise cancellation is really good for ear buds, in my opinion. When I work out I have a large fan on and it typically blocks that out as long as I have music playing. If there is no music, I can typically hear everything around me. The battery life is rather good, my only complaint is, sometimes the left ear bud will just not charge despite being in correctly. But that has only happened a handful of times.', \"Ugh, 5 mos with the AirPod Pros, price has since come down considerably and the pair I have are suffering from the Apple recognized issue of garbled voice transmission and sound. Called Apple Tech Support and it's a horrible experience. They take you through 'trouble shooting' that is so rudimentary that it is pathetic; turn on/off noise cancellation, volume, etc. The person insists reading through the basics and then they don't replace the AirPods but make you find a store in COVID for repair. They are far more interested in selling than helping. ---- Update from last review: I tried again and bought another pair. Still could not pass ear test. Found a test online where it was suggested that someone who can't pass the ear fit test buy a foam ear tip, stipe off the plastic liner and then fit it behind the Apple supplied tips. It took some doing but it did result in 50% of the time I can now pass the ear fit test. Plus because the seal is so much better the noise cancellation works better. I've raised my rating to 4 stars because when properly fitted the sound quality is much better than the AirPods 1st generation but you do have to work on it. I won't return them now. While $260 is a lot for a pair of earbuds I thought having wireless AirPods  with noise cancellation, different size ear tips and better acoustics was worth the money. But alas, even with trying different ear tips I couldn't get the ear fit test to come back positive. I chatted with Apple Support and they told me to ignore the warning that the fit wasn't right because that only is important for noise cancellation or better sound. Hello? Why did I buy them. I know why I returned them a few hours later.\", 'I’ve had these for a while and a pattern I’ve seen is that the AirPods will disconnect from my phone during a call when I put them in my ears to to transfer from talking on the phone to the AirPod pros. Hope that makes sense. There are some other issues, but for the price I had higher expectations for Apple brand products. Seems as though the quality checks before shipping to be sold on market wasn’t there because I had issues within the first 2 months with sound. But I do love being able to charge them after use immediately. And when they are working and low on battery while connected to my phone, I will put one in the charging case while still on the phone. And I can switch them out while talking on the phone and not have to switch over to using the phone to finish my conversation. I love being able to walk around and not have to carry my phone around in order to talk on the phone or listen to music.I really like the noise canceling feature.', 'Airplane tested, no good. I really, strongly wanted the noise cancelling to work for airplane travel. It simply does not. I’m not looking for perfection, just headphones that ease the constant hum. They’re great in stores and on the bus and metro, but they just don’t cancel out the noise of a jet engine on a plane. Great headphones, but not worth the price. They’re worth about half of the MSRP at best.', \"I bought these for my wife, and now that she's working from home, she does lots of Zoom and phone calls. She had complained about other earbuds, saying that it was hard to hear her own voice when on calls, and that people had complained that it was hard to hear her.  I had been using my Gen1 airpods for phone and video calls and found them great, but my wife still complained about not being able to hear herself. These have a pass-through feature that let you hear ambient noise, and she says that makes all the difference. They also have noise cancellation, which she reported as being awesome back in the olden days when she took the bus to and from work.  Remember then, in the before-times?  Sigh.  I have no doubt that the noise cancellation is less powerful than others like Bose or whatever, but it definitely has a significant reduction of external noise and makes lots of irritating situations more tolerable. Finally, she reports that these are quite comfortable and easy to wear for a longer time.  We both have found in-ear buds can be a little uncomfortable, but Apple seems to have found the right balance of in-ear and comfort. Overall, a really nice improvement over the Gen 1 airpods, which I still own, and think are pretty awesome.\", 'Great Product over all, battery life is very good, noise cancelation is great only issue with product that many other people have experiences is loud popping noise that comes from earbuds overtime that man your ear drums hurt which is common product defect per apple store tech that ran diagnoses on my device . I had to exchange my AirPods 2 times by now (once through Amazon and once in apple store) last time in 2021 November, warranty expired 2021 December due to original purchase and now I have same issue, my only option is to buy another pair but I do not want to have the same issue again. Speaking with apple tech in apple store I was told this is common defect that many people are experiencing with with AirPods Pro due to noise cancellation but unfortunately I can not exchange my device because I am out of warranty.', 'Had a little trouble taking the tips out at the beginning because they are really stuck in there out of the box. As I was doing that the left one started making a high pitched noise which was a little off putting but after putting them back in the case they now work well and I have tested them for a few days. If you have issues with normal AirPods falling out of your ears these might be a little bit better. Even with that the right one specifically still get a little loose in my ears while running with all three different ear tips. If you want really good running specific earphones I would recommend the Powerbeats pro. With those headphones you loose the noise canceling but they universally stay better in the ears than the AirPods pro. ****Update: My left ear bud has started to glitch a lot. There is now static, high pitched noises when laying down, and a weird popping sound when listening to music  and watching videos every 5 seconds or so. They also get out of time a lot and when I am working out I have to stop, take them out, and reset them. Overall disappointed that I have to return them as they are out of stock as of right now and I will need to wait for a replacement.', 'I had hoped these would be a huge improvement over my first gen AirPods, but not so. No earth shattering improvement on battery life, they’re not as comfortable as the old ones, and don’t stay in my ears as well(need routine adjusting). The major flaw on these is the “force sensor” button. It’s much too easy to push this button unintentionally. I’ve hung up on people several times now, when simply trying to make an adjustment to the fit while on a call.  I’ve been trying to carefully adjust them, hoping to avoid hitting that button, and I’ve gotten better at it, but it’s just too risky for me to do it while on a call. This issue also causes music to start playing, or the noise cancellation to be turned on or off when simply putting them in my ears. Ideally, there should be a way to disable the button, or change the number of button pushes that activate the functions. On the positive side, switching between devices is much better. I have two phones & going back & forth between them seems much better.', 'Drew’s Review of his new AirPod Pro. (AirPods Pro? AirPod Pros? Whatever.) -Thing they do really well: sound good.   The audio quality is very high, on par with my  Bose earbuds. -Thing they don’t do well: stay in my ears.   At all. -Thing they do really well: cause a ruckus.   They fell out directly in to a full cup of paint and became completely black-batter dipped as I tried to fish them out. -Thing they don’t do well: die from water.   So far they’re working good after me swearing profusely and rinsing them out in the sink. -Thing I’ve been thinking about a lot lately: Love.   I’m quite happy alone, but I wonder if a romantic relationship would bring more fulfillment to my life. -Thing they do well: Play Tori Amos', 'Truly wireless earbuds are game changing. Being able to listen to music so easily without fear to getting snagged is wonderful. These earbuds do not have the best sound or ANC but the complete package is magical for iOS users. Sound is decently well rounded. These do well across a wide range of music genres, audiobooks and movies/shows. ANC is surprisingly strong but will not compare to larger over ear models. Transparency mode keeps you engaged with your surroundings. The integration with iOS is what really sets these apart from competitors. Seamless pairing across all your Apple devices and Siri features. If you’re on Android, look elsewhere unless ANC is top priority. There are many other options that perform close or better for cheaper. For iOS users, the regular AirPods provide 90% of this experience for a much more reasonable price. If ANC is a must and you’re living that blue bubble life, it’s hard to beat this set of earbuds for battery life, performance, and portability.', \"I have a fair number of headphones. Not a ton, but I know what I want and what to expect. I first tried these after having some really disappointing earbuds because I was tired of wearing my over-ear ANC headphones so much. These made me completely ditch them. The are seamless with your iPhone and MacBook, and assuming iPad as well, the sound is excellent and comparable to over-ear, and the ANC is excellent. No, they don't have the best soundstage or the best ANC, but for what they are, they do it better than competitors. When you factor in all of the apple-specific functions... cant go wrong. I returned them and missed them so much I went back to them. I dont use them for running or the gym. I use Vistas for that, because that is what they are made for. I much prefer the AirPods pros though.\", \"These things fell out of my ears every time I did any exercise activity. It was entirely frustrating. It didn't matter which size rubber-thingy I used, they fell out. Because of this, the noise cancellation feature was useless because it works via the seal the rubber stopper is supposed to make with your skin inside your ear. At first, you can feel it and it's great...until 10 minutes later when you spend your time constantly adjusting these things. I returned them and went back to the basics. The original trusty airbuds.\", 'Like: sound quality, noise canceling, I had purchased about 4 different types of JLab ear buds, treblab, and several other earbuds. I kept getting my listener on a phone call annoyed with how loud my background noise was. I finally decided to try the AirPods Pro. I definitely don’t think they are worth the price Apple charges. Love how seamlessly buds pair with my iPhone and iPad. Don’t care for battery life on case or buds. I can’t just tap earbud to answer phone calls, must answer from my phone. (Which I think is ridiculous, since most inexpensive earbuds have this option. Don’t like that they send a cord that is iphone port on one end and usb type C on the other. Absolutely stupid. I have a portable powerbank that I use to charge my earbuds. You need to have a type C/wireless charger to charge earbuds. Only one color white. Boring. Don’t feel as comfortable as my JLAB/other earbuds. Apple has dropped the ball on so many things....', \"I own way too many noise canceling headsets, so I've tried all the competing products form Sony, Bose, and a few others. I recently switched back, after many years, from a Samsung to the iPhone 13 Max Pro. While the battery life is on the short side, these little buds are super easy to pair (on the iPhone -- my PC refuses to recognize them, although it often struggles with other earbuds and headsets as well), work great, with excellent sound quality and comfort. I also love the charging case that I can either plug in or simply drop on a wireless charging base for a quick recharge. These were also refurbished (which I missed when ordering) and I can't tell any difference from a brand-new version, so I'm quite pleased.\", \"After like 2 weeks the left headphone stopped charging in the case, this is the main issue with truly wireless style headphones that each side have their own battery and require individual charging. I read that is this a constant issue and only real way to fix this is to go to Apple. That was way too inconvenient especially in the pandemic where some Apple stores required appointments. Naw, not worth it. Also, no matter what combination of ear tips I tried these did not fit my ears comfortability. They kept falling out, this is more of a personal issue and I'm sure I'm a rare case. However, I've had other earbud style headphones that have stayed in and much more comfortability. ANC, transparency mode and spatial audio were cool but this is just an overpriced product that isn't for everyone in my opinion.\", \"I purchased AirPods Pro on January 14, 2020 and have used them for about 3 weeks. Build Quality Like other Apple products, build quality of AirPods Pro is very good. Both AirPods Pro and case are made of glossy plastic. The case has built-in strong magnet that keeps AirPods in place even if case is opened upside down. Ease of Setup I paired it with my iPhone XR and Google Pixel 4XL. Setting up with both phones were pretty easy. Paring process with iPhone can be started by just opening AirPods Pro case near the phone. Nice graphic images show up on phone screen and guide you through setup process and even explain some of the features. To pair AirPods Pro with an Android phone, you set up as regular bluetooth headphones after press-and-holding the small button on the back of case. You can confirm that AirPods Pro are in bluetooth paring mode by observing the little LED on the front of case turning from green to blinking white. Ease of Use AirPods Pro are very easy to use. Thanks to Automatic Ear Detection (which can be turned off if desired), noise cancellation activates as soon as I put them in my ears. You will also hear a soft chime when AirPods Pro connects to nearby bluetooth-enabled device, which happens instantly usually. Note that AirPods Pro can connect to only one device at a time, so for example, you can't connect them to Macbook and iPhone simultaneously (which I can do with Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II). A single squeeze of AirPods Pro's stem, either left or right, will toggle between playing or pausing music. A double squeeze lets you skip to the next song. A triple squeeze will take you back to the previous song. These music controls worked on Google Pixel 4XL as well (tested with VLC media player app). A squeeze-and-hold of the stem will turn on or off transparency mode by default. This behavior can be configured to different actions on iPhone, iPad, or Mac, but not when connected to an Android, Windows PC, or any other non Apple devices. The only complaint I have is that I cannot change volume by just interacting with AirPods Pro themselves. It's a bit cumbersome to pull out my phone every time I want to change volume. Other wireless earbuds like Bose SoundSport Free have volume controls on earbuds itself. The only option to change volume on AirPods Pro without pulling out phone is to enable Siri on AirPods Pro (one of the squeeze-and-hold actions you can choose) and ask Siri to change volume, which is not as instant as it should be. AirPods Pro comes with silicon tips in three different sizes. The medium ones are already attached on AirPods out-of-box. You can replace them with small or large tips, but beware, they are very hard to take off from AirPods. But that's for good, because, if they accidentally detach from AirPods inside ears, they can be hard to remove or even dangerous. AirPods Pro stayed in my ears well during light gym work out. Noise Cancellation Noise cancellation works surprisingly well. It's weaker than my Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II which I have been using for years, but it's definitely noticeable. I primarily use AirPods Pro in gym where Bose Quiet Comfort headsets are not adequate due to sweating. AirPods Pro's noise cancellation dramatically reduces mechanical noise from other nearby gym equipment. Transparency mode also does its job well. I can hear all the noise just as loud as I hear it without AirPods Pro in my ears. Audio Quality AirPods Pro's audio quality is amazing for earbuds. They seem to have less clearer midrange compared Bose SoundSport Wireless which I had been using in gym but good enough for me for gym use. Charging Charging through lightning connector and wireless charing both work as expected. For wireless charging, I used Ubio Lab's AWC 1080 charing pad. Battery Life The advertised 4.5 hours battery life with noise cancelling on seems accurate. I have yet to test battery life of the case as I recharge both earbuds and case everyday. To see battery levels of earbuds and case on iPhone, put earbuds in case and open it near the phone. You will see battery levels of earbuds and case separately (see photo). On Macbook (I used 15-inch 2018 Macbook Pro), go to Bluetooth icon on menu bar and mouse over to AirPods Pro (see photo). You can even see battery levels of left and right earbuds separately. However, there is no way to see battery levels of earbuds or case on Google Pixel 4XL. Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II and Bose SoundSport Wireless show battery levels near Bluetooth icon, so this is a room for improvement for AirPods Pro, if Apple wants to sell AirPods Pro to Android users.\", \"I used to find it quite irritating as to what the hype was seeing everyone wear the freaking apple white colored airpods. But then recently I had to get my landline cancelled and switch completely to my cellphone for personal and office use. So I thought I needed a pair of headphones that would be light, durable and give me good sound quality. So long story short, the sound quality is incredible. I have BOSE soundsport Free Headphones and the sound compares to those if not better than those. The noise cancelling is surprisingly great!! Like holy cow great!. But for my phone calls I absolutely LOVE the transparency mode. It is amazing how natural they make a phone call feel. I have often found that phone calls with stereo headphones, especially ear buds to feel quite cumbersome and disorienting in how they muffle everything and how you can't even hear your own voice while speaking. The transparency mode works incredibly well for phone calls. And lastly the battery life and the seamlessness of how well they work with the iPhone and my macbook makes this one of the best headphone purchases ever. I have a Plantronics BackBeat Pro, a Bose QC 35 and a Bose Soundsport Free all of which are great but I find that my Airpods have quickly risen to the very top of the list and now my other headphones are sitting in a drawer gathering dust. I highly recommend these.\", \"I received my AirPod Pro's last week and I was really excited to get them after reading and viewing (online) all the positive reviews.  I have to say, I'm extremely disappointed so far.  I got them to use and make conference calls with while working from home.  When I initially started using them I was impressed, the sound quality was very good and the microphone worked well for my conference calls.  When I listen to high quality music they're impressive, not as much with average recordings but good enough and better than most earbuds I've used in the past. On the first day of use, I charged them and started using them for conference calls and watching videos.  About 3 hours into my day the right AirPod battery quit without notice, I tried to carry on my call but people couldn't hear me. I put the AirPod back into the case and after 5 minutes of charging I was good to go for the rest of the call. I like to listen to music with the volume up but not overly loud.  The ANC really adds to the overall sound but listening with the ANC on and the music above the midpoint, I found that the battery didn't get anywhere close to what Apple have stated. Today was my 4th day using the AirPods Pro's, after about 10 minutes on my first call the right AirPod died, it shows full charge but I get no sound out of it whatsoever.  I tried putting it back in the case, listening on different devices and even cleaning them but with no luck.  Maybe I just got a bad pair of AirPod pro's so I'll give them another chance.  For the amount of money I paid for these, I expected more.  I'll try one more time but so far I'm very disappointed.\", 'Fortunately I managed to lose my first generation airpods, case and all, so decided to upgrade to these. They are a quantum leap forward. Not only do they fit better in my ears due to the custom sizes, but even without noise cancelation turned on, they do a great job of eliminating outside sound. The transparency mode works great- sound quality is the same, but you can listen out for important things/people. I am a classical musician, and this music has a lot of pauses and soft passages, which the noise cancelation shows off very well. Also, the sound changes very very little with it on compared to off, which sounds the absolute best IMHO. I miss the total comfort of the originals as well as the ease of tapping vs. squeezing; but the differences are worth it and I understand why Apple made these changes. The sound is very flat and natural, not overly bassy. If you want to change the EQ, that can be done within settings.  And, I just took a shower with them in.  Could also work in a bathtub I presume. Nice to have Siri and all controls available even in the shower! Bathroom speakers work, but not with this great sound, and noise reduction! I own some excellent and more expensive full sized headphones that are great for listening critically, but these certainly hold their own.  I like them more than the wired Bose earbuds I used for long time until the wires frayed. Finally, I have a full beard and even though these new Airpods are shorter than the original and the ends are within my beard, people tell me my sound on the phone is perfect.  So, I would recommend these to any iPerson who can afford them.', \"Update 2021 As an Apple Product, it has one major flaw: No iCloud lock! All it took was minutes of distraction, and my Airpods went missing.  Despite locating it within 100 feet on Findmyiphone, the map image had already gone static. Someone had already unpaired it and taken it for their own in those few minutes! Since it has a serial number, why can't it be reported lost and locked like all the other Apple products, or even bricked?? I won't recommend it to anyone until they fix that issue. Rest of review The connection to the iPhone is better than any of the other Bluetooth headsets that I have tried. But the connection is still inconsistent. Pairing with Macbook Pro is hit-and-miss and frequently requires having to turn off then on the Bluetooth connection.  Noise-canceling is reasonable for use in cars and planes. However, with it on, nearby people's voices are easily audible - that is very distracting when trying to have a conversation on the phone. With no apparent sidetone, I found myself talking louder than with phone to face.\", 'I’m not impressed overall the sound quality is mediocre the voice activation stuff is cool till other people in the room say hey Siri and your stuffs doing who knows what The main reason I got them however was for running and they fall out even tho the app says I got a good fit they fall out hit the road constantly pushing them back in. lol m gonna see if I can tolerate it but might just give them to my wife and go back to my cheap 25 dollar pair that stayed in my ear. I had high hopes that Apple ffigured this out friends all told me no I they will stay in your ear I swear and alas nope there almost worthless for what I wanted them for. Now for around the house and wtvr there fine but I have Bose headphones for that and there way better What is cool tho is the transparent sound setting with no miuaic going I can almost hear better I also can hear what’s going on better when sound is on. The noise canceling isn’t bad for what it is tho Bose is better. If your a heavy duty runner and have had issues with these kinds of things falling out good chance these will too and who knows how many times they can hit the road before there trashed', 'I purchased $4k hearing aids that stream only to find that they are limited in frequency response. These however sound very good. They are also programable with an audiogram supplied by your doctor or with a self audiogram. The noise cancellation is pretty good and I fall asleep at night easily listening to the tunes. The transparency mode acts like a hearing aid and amplifies human speech clearly when not streaming. When streaming the transparency still works pretty well. There are apps available allowing you to program even deeper. I use a 16 band EQ app to overcome my hearing issues and make the music sound even better. Battery life is about 4 hours. If Apple can find a way to get 16 hours out of them I will ditch my hearing aids and use these exclusively.', 'I mainly bought them for working out and I finally did it because I read a review indicating that they will hold up to sweat. I have only used them a few times, but so far so good. The active noise cancellation and transparency mode both work well. The sound quality is very good. One of the main things I like is that you can pause, forward, jump back, and switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode using the single control button, which are present on both ear pieces. Although there are apparently some higher-end immersive movie functions that will only work on newer Apple devices, I really don’t need them for that. For my purposes they work fine with a Pixel 3 phone. They work equally well with my newer iPad of course.', 'These are my life line and my escape from all the annoying noises and people around me. Apple’s noise canceling technically is in my opinion equal to the iPhone. No more are the days when I just want to yell at someone to “shut the F#¢k up” now I just click a button and I’m in a world where I control whatever I want to hear with very minimal interference for my environment. Seriously tho I’m extremely sensitive to noise and I easily become very overwhelmed by it and it can drastically impair my mood and sometimes give me panic attacks and I can get very hostile so these truly were a game changer for me by giving me the ability to control and limit all this noise without having to use more noise to do it with.', 'This product is almost perfect and probably could be if they fixed two issues. The first, and main, issue I faced was the microphone quality. I was extremely disappointed in the quality. People have repeatedly commented that I am very scratchy on calls and I’ve recorded myself multiple times on Voice Memos using these and the quality was subpar. They actually had worse quality than my iPhone’s built-in microphone and even the Lightning Connector Earpods that came with my phone. I’ve tried troubleshooting this multiple ways including, forgetting the device completely and pairing it again (exactly according to instructions in box) and turning my phone completely off and on again to no avail. I also found that the volume level was somewhat lower than I expected. It isn’t extremely quiet, but to me it just seems a bit low. Now, I don’t know if I am just unlucky and I’ve received a dud or if my expectations for this product are unreasonable, but I’d just like to see these problems resolved if not for my sake, then for the sake of others. Other than those issues, I love the noise cancellation and the battery life is phenomenal.', 'I have been wanting to get a set of AirPods for the last several months, especially after my cats got a hold of my headphones and chewed them up. #catlife At first, I was wicked hesitant to purchase due to how expensive the AirPod pros were. But I read and watched several reviews and thought I’d make the purchase. I wanted a product that had great noise cancellation, sufficient battery life and great sound quality. The AirPods are an authentic apple product. I read that a few reviewers were questioning their authenticity. They are easy to use too. The packaging was perfection. Apple knows how to brand and package their products so I was impressed. The noise cancellation was wicked great! You can still hear some noise but it’ll cancel at least 90% of the noise around you. Also the battery life is amazing! I’ve had my AirPods for roughly three days and I haven’t had to charge them yet (probably will charge them today). I use them a few hours a day. If you’re on the fence about them, don’t be. They are worth the money.', \"Try as I might I could not get these to stay in my ears if I moved past just walking. I tried each of the ear inserts and eventually purchased some hooks that claimed to help keep them in. They didn't work either. Apple needs to do more research into ear types, I guess. BTW my kids each have no difficulty keeping the buds in. Go figure.\", 'First off, if you know you have small ears, this may not work. The round bulbous part was too big, and one would fall out if I was chewing, and never quite felt secure. And I was using the smallest plastic earbud piece - the part that goes in your ear canal isn’t the problem.  Second, the narrow part that drops down would tap on my earrings; definitely no earrings with these if you have small ears. Third, callers couldn’t hear me if I was lying down.  Fourth, when I got 8 feet away from the phone (in my kitchen) I started to hear interference on calls. Returned them. For people with small ears, the sam sung buds plus fit much better. Sorry, Apple, really wanted these with my new iPhone 12 mini.', \"I just got my AirPod Pros. My daughter has the regular AirPods, but the earpiece was very uncomfortable for me so I never bought any for myself.  When these came out,  with a different style of earpiece,  I decided to treat myself. I like everything about them except for the fact that they came without a plug.  They can be charged with a wireless charger and they came with a cord, but the cord doesn't fit the standard plug.  I don't have a wireless charger,  and I don't have the special plug that fits the cord, so I've ordered one.  No big deal, it didn't cost a lot,  but I wish I had understood this before I ordered the AirPods so I could have ordered the plug to come with it.  This is a problem because right now, I have AirPods and once the initial charge wears off, they won't be usable until I get the special plug...  We're still on some COVID19 restrictions right now,  so I can't just rush out and buy one.  I have to order it and wait for it to arrive. .  I'm not happy about that but I love AirPods.  Just wish the original info had been clear about what came and did not come in the package.  Since every other Apple product I've bought always came with what it needed, I assumed my AirPods did as well.  WRONG!\", \"Look, I'm not an Apple fanboy by any stretch of the imagination, as a matter of fact I tried to leave the Applesphere by buying a Pixel 4 and a set of Galaxy Buds+. But I'll tell you what, Apple just does it better ( I found that out when I got tired of the Google Assistant and bought an iPhone 11). The Galaxy Buds+ didn't fit very well, the Air Pods do. The Galaxy Buds+ touch controls led to a lot of accidental pauses and skips, the Air Pods don't. The Galaxy Buds+ sound quality wasn't that great for the price, the Air Pods quality is really good for the price. When it comes down to it I was worried about the fit the most, and Im pleased to report the fit is really comfortable and secure. I did a few plyometric workouts (a lot of jumping around) and the Air Pods didn't even come loose much less fall out. The active noise cancellation is super nice, I can sit next to a noisy fan in my hot office and not even hear the fan. The battery life leaves a bit to be desired, only 4.5 hours on continuous play with active noise cancellation on, but that just means I have to charge the Air Pods over lunch, no big deal. These true wireless ear buds are just a better product for iPhone users, I' glad I waited for the Pro version, but I wish I had bought them sooner.\", 'I accidentally washed my old AirPods and Samsung Buds in the washing machine, so I needed a nice new set of Bluetooth headphones. Let me just say these bad boys were worth every penny!! Before purchasing, I tried buying some cheaper alternatives that were honestly just OKAY... though the AirPod Pro’s just blew me away. The noise cancellation feature is what wowed me the most. The old AirPods I had didn’t have that feature, so it’s such a pleasant addition. I have been enjoying these for about a month now. Battery life is great. I can probably get 6 hours out of them. Side note: I know there will be temptation for you to try Apple Music’s new Lossless feature with their streaming service, but the feature is just okay. I’ll be sticking with Spotify because it sounds just as amazing. Don’t hesitate!! Get these bad boys!!', \"It's very hard to impress me when it comes to switching from headphones to earphones. That being said, the reason I wanted the Airpod Pros was because Airpods/Pros are discreet looking (not disappointed at all in that factor by the way.) I am and still am in love with my Beats Studio 2.0s. Before you roll your eyes and read the next review, I've found a way to improve sound quality in them, by upping the dB rating on iTunes for my music. My point is: my Beats Studio 2.0s are SUPER loud and the bass is smooth and rocky at the same time. But, for working, working out, etc., I have a hard time keeping them on. I did NOT want to pay $250 for …… earphones! Anyways, I finally had them delivered, ready to be disappointed, and I was … for about an hour. Once I got used to the sound, it started sounding more and more like my Beats Studios. Keep in mind that even if you hate Beats products, headphones are still always going to beat earphones when it comes to sound. But wow, these are so close to my Beats, and I am still shocked. Connecting them to your phone is easy, the bass is the best it gets with earphones (and I mean this in a good way, because the bass really does sound good if they're pushed all the way in your ear) and they're so discreet and nice looking! I know the design received lots of hate, and that's understandable. They look like mini hair dryers, or the water nozzle gun from Mario Sunshine lmao, but in reality, when they're in your ears, they look and feel amazing. They stay in so well, it's shocking. Seriously, if you take anything from this, know that I am a diehard and very picky headphone user, and listen to music constantly, and yet I'm still shocked. The only negative thing is Apple's greed which can get the best of people based on brand names. I can't justify the price range, so I would suggest waiting until they're around $150-200 (even though that'll never happen, so maybe you should bite the bullet and go for it!)\", 'Had a Sony over the ear Bluetooth-  noise cancelling set. They were great but had received them as a Christmas gift :). They were not water/sweat resistant, i.e.running in the rain was a no go!  I returned them to Costco and ordered these from the Apple store on Amazon. They’re choice!! I love them. They really are very well thought out. They even fit my ears with the ear pieces that were factory installed. They pair seamlessly with my iPhone 11 and Mac Air. They are a delight to use. I was confused though when it came time to charge the case. This 200+ set of earbuds did not include the newest style of outlet plug needed to charge them. It did include a wire with usb on one end and a new style connector on the other. I did some research and immediately ordered a black Aukey wall charger. It has a few items that can be plugged into it including the new USB-C.  Apple  really should at least let people know they will need to purchase this new format wall plug. I think I paid 12-15 bucks for the USB-C.', '', 'I listen to a lot of music and I have been wowed by headphones before. Back in the day with my walkman I used to use headphones with foam covers and would be wowed by the bass. Pros: 1. Integrates very well with the apple ecosystem: Siri, notifications, Apple Watch, etc all simply just works! 2. Battery life is not too bad 3. looks like a tic tac 4.The AirPods seem best suited for talking rather than listening to music. 5. Noise cancellation is quite good. the con: 1. Note: just an average music listener, I was not impressed with the sound quality. 2. tried on different bud sizes but after 15mins my ears hurt 3. The low frequency sounds (bass) not very impressed. 4. Not enough options with the haptic clicks (Siri, choose between play,pause,next,prev,volume) 5. When talking, mic picks up a lot of background noise, though the noise Is cancelled for me, but the other end of the line can hear the same noise. I would not buy this again', 'The active noise cancellation is in all honesty pretty amazing.  There’s very little white noise when nothing’s playing and the ability to eliminate noise; especially steady state noise, is kinda mind blowing. I found a tip that’s comfortable for me, so I often forget they are in my ear.  The only time I break the ear seal is when chewing. Transparency mode is convenient and almost must in some situations. These buds don’t get insanely loud, just loud enough. I find the sound quality is actually very good, a huge improvement over the AirPods.  The sound is very neutral though, so this may be why more people don’t talk about the sound quality.  Not too bass heavy, no artificially bright highs, just a balanced, true to life, full sound. Nothing even comes for ease or connection with an iPhone.  Crack open the AirPod case and they are paired instantly. These are the hands down the best in-ear headphones on the market right now.  Yes, they are better than the Sony’s pretty much across the board except for batt life', 'Sound/noise cancelling is amazing. Literally can’t hear people open my door or walk up to me while studying with these in. Even in loud cafes, I pop these bad boys in and peoples loud conversation and cafe music disappear as you get into the zone studying. My only issue with the airpods is the fit. It comes with small, medium, and large buds (originally fitted with medium) and that was too small as it fell out of my ear if I tilted or moved my head too much. Same thing happened with the large but for the opposite reason, because it was too large and would push itself out if I did the same movements described above. Maybe it’s just my specific ear hole shape/size? So I personally can’t really use this for jogging but great for studying.', 'Pro: - Good enough audio for workouts... - But they don’t stay in my ears when I look down. And yes, I ran the fit test on all of the eartip sizes. - Great under a motorcycle helmet to reduct noise if you also use a gaiter to keep them in place. - Can use one at a time to double charge time, if using as a phone headset. Cons: - Short battery life for my uses. I get about 3.5 hours on my new pair and it will only get shorter. - Most Bluetooth headsets drop connections when one’s body is between the phone and the earbud. Not these. No issue. - I still get intermittent drops in connection, for no apparent reason, when using only one earpiece.', 'I used these AirPods for about a month riding the train to work and I loved them. They blocked out a lot of the train and passenger noises.  I also paired them with my iPhone and iPad and the AirPods worked great especially playing games. If you are having charging issues with your AirPods, go online to troubleshoot them or call Apple. I discovered that when you return your AirPods to Amazon and you purchased AppleCare then you have to contact Apple for a refund for the AppleCare. Some reviewers complained that Amazon did not refund their AppleCare and I think this is why. Pros: -the active noise cancellation does a good job reducing, but it does not eliminate all noises. -the transparency mode works well if you want to hear your surroundings. -the AirPods were very light and easy to place in my ears. -the AirPods charge very fast in the charging case -the sound quality is awesome for talking on the phone Cons: -they are expensive with AppleCare -Apple does not include an wall adapter with it just a cable cord -the AirPods can cause discomfort if you push them too far in your ear, but sometimes you have to ensure the active noise cancellation works better -my left AirPod would not hold the same charge as the right one (I did return them after speaking with an Apple advisor)', \"1/27 Update after a couple of weeks of use.... So now that I have time with them, they are simply that much better all around. They stay in place during any activity--- workouts, eating, talking, etc....and all without any bad pressure points or excessive pressure on your ear. Sound quality is very good and I often use them one at a time. With that said.... The first time I put them both in and have it set to noise cancelling....WOW. walking the dog in 20mph winds....no problem for me to hear as all background noise is negligible and the equally awesome part is with all 4 mics active.....the caller hears only your voice. Siri works well and I am still exploring what can be done with voice commands. At first I was going to keep my others....they are now up for sale. These are just that much better to use. Original post So yes, we all know they are expensive. I have tried and had well over 30 different types of headphones, ear buds, both Bluetooth and wired... For me I like to use a single earbud for phonecalls--- just been my preference whether at the office or walking the dog. Needless to say my last single earbud decided to die and I was left with looking for a replacement. I did try a couple of others and although sound quality was good and noise cancellation was also much better than in the past, fitment was a huge issue. So for the AirPod Pro I have to say that I have already worn them well over a dozen hours since I received them a couple days ago. Fit is very good. I can talk, chew gum, eat food--- and they stay in and feel like they're going to stay in. Others I have tried will fall out the more I move my jaw. Maybe it is just me, but in this case it has to be about me. I do use them in transparent mode, which is slick--- allows you to hear what is around you and if you have both in, you can pause your music and don't have to pull one out to hear someone talk to you. Another great feature is that they allow your ears to balance properly with atmospheric pressure. All others that I have had caused pressure in my ears at some point or another. These allow them to equalize and simply is one of the many great features. So beyond that, sound reproduction is good. Make that really good for such a small device. Add in the fact you can use Siri without a button is also a huge plus. Talking to people and noise cancellation is so far--- excellent. Pairing was as simple as having my phone in one hand, the AirPods in their case in the other and opening the top of the case...done in 10-seconds. Overall I will use them quite a bit, but I still have my wired Bose and a set of wireless Beats that I still rely on. The biggest issues with the Bose and Beats is they are geared towards playing music, etc...not talking unless you're in a quite room. Maybe they will all go on the wayside once I use these more....but so far, I am happy.\", 'So, my wife got me a set for my birthday in November to replace my last (3rd) pair of regular AirPods.  (The microphone stops working on my AirPods after a while.) I liked them enough to buy her a pair for Xmas. BUT... These things will NOT stay in my ears. I have them in all day and one or the other  pop out at least half a dozen times during day. I’ve had them for a month and already lost one, then found it in a puddle under my car. The old AirPods seemed like they would fall out but very rarely did. That being said, I really like the noise canceling as well as the noise enhancing.  So, I am keeping mine and getting  her a pair.', 'I got these because they were basically on sale for like 179.99 on here and I just got some gift cards and money for my birthday. I have the original AirPods but to be honest I’ll probably never go back to them. The sound quality is amazing. I especially love how I can switch from surround sound to the regular on these (I do the beta tests for iOS 15 so not sure if that’s a feature for everyone yet) Noise cancellation is pretty good, especially considering these aren’t over the ear headphones. We have 2 other kids in the house and it won’t always cancel out videos they watch on YouTube but it definitely lowers the volume a noticeable amount. When music is playing I can’t hear a thing most of the time. In the car, my parents play their music pretty loud and I can barely hear it, which is saying a lot since my old AirPods had to be at almost full volume to not hear their music. Transparency mode is great, especially if you have problems hearing, I feel like it makes things a bit louder but I could be wrong. Then you can turn both cancelation and transparency off which kinda still muffles the sound around you. Battery life so far is pretty good, I’ve only had them about a day but I’m sure it’ll be better than my old AirPods, especially considering that those are a few years old now. The tips that go in your ears are amazingly soft, typically when I wear earbuds with those tips they hurt my ears after awhile, but I don’t see that becoming a problem with these. I also like the different sizes and how apple is able to tell you if the fit is right (you do this by going to settings, Bluetooth, click the I by _____‘s airpod pros, then scroll down and it should say test the fit or something like that) Last major thing I want to highlight is the surround sound vs the regular sound. Not sure if everyone has these feature or not but I am in love with it. The surround sound makes it feel like the audio is coming in all different directions, and when you move your head the audio moves with it, if that makes sense. My only complaint is that the charger that comes with them is lightening to usb-c instead of usb. I’ve heard that USB-c charges faster but I can’t confirm that since I don’t have a block that fits usb-c. Of course you can still wirelessly charge or use the charger that you use for your phone (lightening to usb) instead, it’s just a bit annoying. I do expect that to get better after awhile though when usb-c becomes more common', 'Here\\'s the problem I\\'m experiencing after receiving these Airpods today: I have a 15\" Macbook Pro - Retina mid-2015 laptop and also a 13\" Macbook Pro early 2015 laptop. The cable that came with the Airpods Pro won\\'t fit into any port on either of these computers. I have read online that the 15 inch has a USB-C port but I assure you I can\\'t plug in this cord to a port on my computer. The ports simply aren\\'t wide enough. I shouldn\\'t have to purchase an adapter, but is that the only solution left if I want to charge the Airpods while connected to my Macbooks? Edited to say: I put the cable that came with the AirPods Pro back into the box and I\\'m using another cable I had that will allow me to charge these. Now, if I could just figure out why my laptop will not allow me to update to Catalina . . . . OK, I\\'ve got Catalina but am unable to get Noise Cancellation to work. 1) Bluetooth is on; 2) Noise Cancellation is checked; 3) Can hear tv blaring in the room. Also, Apple won\\'t recognize my purchase date from Amazon in order to tell me if my serial number is legit! Sigh', 'I\\'ve used numerous wireless headsets especially since trying to find a pair that can handle the sweat of my active lifestyle has been a challenge. With the AirPod Pros, I love the sound quality. The noise cancellation is comparable to Bose products that I have and still use. However, the reason for the low rating is they don\\'t work a lot of the times.  More times than not, one of the buds doesn\\'t function. Or it will function for a few minutes and cut off. It makes this (Apple-Only-Knows) noise and cuts off.  Very, very frustrating. I will be starting a 30 mile bike ride and spend 15 minutes trying to find the stand-on-one-foot or whatever secret process I can use to get them \"both\" to work. For $$230 I\\'m not impressed. I feel like a paying Beta-Tester. I now have to keep a backup headset because I don\\'t trust the AirPod Pros and I\\'m out of my 30 day Amazon window and cannot return them. I hate poor quality and these just don\\'t function properly enough of the time to say that it is a quality product. Apple tried within their workflow to address the pods. Why they just didn\\'t replace them is where I have issue.  I spent more time at least 4 appointments incidents over these airpods and I have eventually given up. THEY JUST DON\\'T WORK.  Worst Product I\\'ve ever bought from Apple. :-(', \"For the past 3 years, I used Beats solos while I got through my Masters and Doctorates. 1/2 way to the finish line my Beats gave out, plus the fabric was finally ripping of the ears. I did a lot of research before getting these and I was very hesitant about getting cordless ear buds.  These are BEYOND my expectations! The sound is a bit bassy, but clear, I listen to a lot loci, you can hear every crack and pop, I love it.  Buds usually don't stay in my ears,  they are quite comfortable,  I hardly know I am wearing them and the noise cancelling is amazing. My spouse can play video games on surround sound and I can't even hear it. They are simple to use and I so nice to have!  Any one on the fence about these, I would say that this is one of the best purchases I have made in a very long time.\", 'First off I wanted to say I am a brand kind of guy and Apple is the brand of choice, not only for myself but my ENTIRE family is Apple. We have several iPads, a Mac Book. All 6 phones on my contract are the latest of iPhone models  and we also have 2 pair of AirPod Pros.  I bought my wife the first set and she just absolutely raved about them.  The sound quality.  Battery life and all that is Apple.  So I ordered me a set and before I go off on this little tear, I just want to reiterate that my family is Apple through and through.  I am a truck driver and the only headset I ever sported is a Blue Parrot B450-XT. The headset is bulky, heavy on one side , the range is t that great and if you wear it long enough you’re ear will start to feel like someone hit you upside the head with a 2x12.  That being said..,the ABSOLUTE BEST THING about this headset is the noise canceling ability.  I could stand out by my truck getting fuel at a truck stop with not only my hood up and engine running but multiple other trucks at the fuel stop fueling their trucks with the engines running and some with their hoods up.  My point is...the people that I were in the phone with had ABSOLUTELY no idea what I was in the middle of a slew of running trucks fueling as I was because the noise cancellation is SO GOOD on this unit.  However, as I said before, this unit is bulky, heavy and puts quite a bit of pressure on your ear the longer you wear it.  I have 7” straight stacks and they are loud and the one on the driver side of my truck is no more than 14” away from my head so my ears get a workout and one last time...the B450-XT’s noise canceling ability is second to none! Now..back to my love of all things Apple. I absolutely love these AirPod Pros....with the exception of the noise canceling ability.  They are so versatile and very comfortable to wear.  You could literally wear them all day and not miss out on anything going on around you with the Transparency mode.  It absolutely pains me that I can’t wear them as much as I would like but if I am in my truck driving down the road the people I am talking to tell me that it is so loud and there is so much background noise during our conversation.  Even if I am just idling my truck sitting somewhere the people I am on the phone with complain about the background noise and they aren’t the only side to complain...if I am not driving and just sitting with my truck idling their voices cut in and out as if I was dipping in and out of cell service. There you have it...I am still an Apple guy and my family is still an Apple family and these AirPod Pros are still an amazing accessory to have..if you are t a truck driver with a set of straight pipes.', 'Worth it. Comfortable, good noise cancellation, long-lasting battery, convenient (and strong) connection. Apple knows what’s up. The Transparency mode sounds far more natural than any other earbuds I’ve tried that have had something similar. You can turn it on and function perfectly normally by hearing everything around you. The active noise cancellation blocks out background, low-tone sounds. Sporadic, high-tones will still come through a bit, but they’re muffled. You’ll still be able to hear people talk to you, but it’s muffled. It’s perfect. The pass-through prevents that uncomfortable pressure from being built up in your ear. This relieves pressure on your eardrum, so you don’t need the volume as loud to hear your music well. The noise cancellation does the rest, by muting background noise. This might seem unimportant, but it honestly is making a huge difference for me. Since buying these, the average DB level that I listen to my music at has gone down from upper 70’s to mid 40’s. So if you listen to music and podcasts all day like me, this is critical for hearing health.', 'I bought airpod-pro for my wife and she generally watches videos on macbook pro and switch back to iPhone while she receives any phone call. Airpod Pro switches audio smoothly from macbook to iphone without clicking any reconnect button on iphone but it doesn\\'t switch audio when she receives WhatsApp call, even it doesn\\'t automatically switch with any other app also. E.g. if we watch YouTube on macbook and want watch or listen youtube on iphone, we will have switch manually by selecting audio output.   I have been using Bose headphone and it is awesome it does transfer audio from macbook to iphone or android phone and vice versa automatically without any click, and it also works with every app e.g. WhatsApp, Phone(call), YouTube etc. One more thing which is important to me atleast, when we watch YouTube on macbook and receive WhatsApp call on phone then it says that \"<Caller name> is calling\" and YouTube will be paused on macbook. Airpod pro doesn\\'t recognize even, but it does work only with actual phone call but it doesn\\'t say that \"someone is calling\" only beeps.', \"These things drive me nuts.  They don't really stay in my ear all that well and when one falls out, the sound cuts out and I have to connect all over again.  I have a cheap pair of wireless buds that I bought to go for a walk or a run and you know what, I prefer those... Sure, the sound quality isn't nearly as good but they are a fraction of the price and they stay in better.  And I can run with just one of them in.  I like to run with only one ear bud in so that I can hear traffic noise and/or if at night, can just generally be aware of my surroundings.  Can't do that with these.  According to some help articles, you're supposed to be able to use just one.  I followed the directions and for me they won't work unless they are both in my ear. Buy if you must have excellent quality.  For me, as someone who just wants some music in my ear as I run so that I can tolerate the run or so I can listen to an audio book or Netflix, this was an expensive purchase that definitely doesn't seem worth it.  I've started using my $18 more often--the charge lasts for 24hours plus and it's not always falling out of my ear\", 'I do not like the way these AirPods fit; they’re always falling out of my ears. Fortunately, an AirPod missed the dog’s bowl of water one time when one fell out! I’ve bought several other rubber end pieces and two types of hooks but they are still uncomfortable, occasionally fall out, and don’t fit as well as the ones I paid $100 less (unfortunately I gave those to my daughter when I thought I was upgrading to this newest version)! The noise canceling function stopped working properly after about a month. The battery life is okay but about the same as the older version I gave to my daughter. Finally, I don’t like that I can’t tap to answer the phone like the older version, sometimes hanging up on the new caller if I’m already talking when a call comes in. I have always bought Apple products, iPhones, MacBooks etc. and have been very satisfied until now. I’m glad that I bought the extended warranty because they no longer work properly and I’ve given up hope that I’ll find a way to make them work.', 'These integrate to my iPhone seamlessly.  Very happy with the noise cancellation.  My biggest and pretty much only gripe is overall low end bass response just isn\\'t much there.  At very low volumes it\\'s passable but at a higher level such as when I want it loud while on the treadmill etc the bass response is very weak.  Even with Apple\\'s \"bass boost\" selected in settings.  I know it\\'s probably just me and everyone is different.  Considering the price of the iPhone, Airpods, iMac, etc I would like to see a real parametric equalizer that lets me make MY sound.  Not some pre selected dose of moderation that Apple decides is right for me.  If I want to blast Motley Crue or Sabbath that\\'s my option.  Great midrange but the bottom below 100Hz  is missing.  I know there are 3rd party apps for equalization but you lose the seamlessness of integration.', 'This surprised me how much I like these. Use them for work primary (remote work still) and they’re very comfortable. Sound quality is excellent as in charge life. One charge lasts a few days so I only charge once a week. That’s pretty amazing. Case holds another charge when the Air Pods are in them. Easy to know when charge is full or needed by different color lights. Charges with same iPhone cable. Really love them. Quality and easy, long lasting charge, as well as comfort and sound quality has made the price almost reasonable, haha. Truly worth the investment. Highly recommend. Fits well and they stay in and don’t fall out. Also got a case for them that makes the case less slippery for me. Skins and case cover options are plenty out there and many are really great and clever looking. Adds to the pros of buying the Air Pods. A great product.', 'Sound and easiness to pair make these well worth the money. I have an iPhone and MacBook and it took literally no effort to pair. I was set up before I even tried to get set up! I did buy a protective case to go over the Apple one, because it didn’t seem like it could take a fall and I didn’t want to break the case. The sound quality is tremendous and the microphones for talking to someone on the phone are fantastic- perfectly clear both ways. The only drawback is that they should have made the battery life a little better. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not bad by any standard- it’s just that I think Apple could have done a better job. A fully charged case can power the pods at least 3-4 times before you have to charge the case. I just wish the pods lasted a little longer per charge.', 'Well these babies lived up to it’s Hype. I wanted something smaller than my over the ears Sony’s and these did the trip. Is the ANC super awesome? Well I say it’s 8.5/10 but that’s expected from ear buds but they do a darn good job. I did get that weird smell like people mentioned but that’s the smell of silicone I guess and it’s not that bad really. The size fits my ear perfect but after an hour or two my inner ear tends to hurt but that might be just me. They stay in place most of the time but if you sweat they might pop out or wiggle free from time to time but that’s fine with can just have to readjust. I use these for running, bike riding, cutting the grass(almost ran one over not sure how lol) these are worth the money and right now 9/14/2020 they are 199.99 almost thirty dollars cheaper. So jump on these. Amazon is quick to ship and their customer service is always on point. (Experiences may vary) so many EarPods are in the market right now but they will not be nearly as awesome. I also tried the Samsung buds live from the wife and those were terrible in my opinion lol. Cheers everyone', 'I read a LOT of reviews before I bought these, and as is the usual case the whiners are just that. Cutting through all the BS, these things are AWESOME! I recently retired and now spend a good bit of time on my tractor and a ZTR mower, both of which are loud.  I, before now, used multiple types of techno toys to listen to my audio books and music while working.  My hope was that the ‘noise cancellation’ feature of these babies would relieve my listening woes. Well, simply put, they did.  It plain amazed me that I could crank my tractor up to 2600 RPM’s and could still easily hear the narrator of my book.  Same for the mower.  I can hear some outside noise, but it is non-consequential, I can still hear my books/music VERY well! I am quite pleased with these EarPods.  My only gripe is the listening time per charge (roughly 4.5 hrs per charge), but this would probably be good for most.  What I do is put them on charge when I go to the house for a drink or something to eat, they recharge fairly quickly. So again, I would definitely recommend these for those that use loud equipment and want to listen to music or books. I haven’t received a call while wearing them yet but will update when I do👍🏻 Update 4-14-20 I recently received a call while wearing these.  I spent a good deal of time on the phone with my daughter while I was outside dragging brush, and it was quite windy as well. After hanging up and my book automatically restarting, I realized that I had not mentioned that I had my new AirPods in. So I called her back and asked if she could hear me ok during our last call.  She said it sounded like I was holding the phone and talking. When I asked about the wind noise, she said she couldn’t hear anything but me.  WAY COOL!!! I asked her to hold a minute and started up my Polaris Ranger and took off down the drive.  When asked, she said she could hear something in the background but could still hear me fine.  And as well, I could hear her just fine.  I LOVE these things and again strongly recommend them for those of us that are NOT couch potatoes and stay busy!', \"Don't waste your money on any other Bluetooth headphone. This one is almost perfect. For Apple users the functionality and connectivity is 1000% superior to all of the Bluetooth headphones. The only negative that I can say about this device is after three months the rubber in-ear portion, Loses its grip and it's ability to cohesively attached to your skin, causing the airport to drop out. You can simply purchase a new one from the Apple store directly for four dollars. In my opinion this is a manufacturing oversight and you should not have to spend a penny. Nonetheless I would recommend this to anyone that uses an Apple product. The wireless charging is phenomenal the battery lasts an extremely long time. I seem to change it once a week and I usually listen for a maximum of four hours a day. And the connectivity, as I've said before Is second to none.\", 'The airpods I received were used which was not in the description. I opened up the box to find dirt on the case and inside the case. When i tried to pair my headphones it said “Laurens Airpods” and my name is not lauren….so just be aware that while some may be new some also may be used which is not what i was paying for', \"I have had these only three days, and I'm hooked. I've been collecting headphones, and a few earbuds too, for years. Liked a lot of them but never felt as if I had found something just right. The newest Sony cans have fabulous sound and noise cancellation, but their onboard controls frustrated me too much to want to keep them. The best Bose cans sound great too, but BT connectivity is sometimes a hassle, and the cord is a nuisance. Apple's AirPods Pro paired instantly with my iPhone and my Mac laptop ... as if they were just part of the family. When I put them in my ears they instantly felt like they were part of me, too. I can wear them for hours at a time and hardly notice they are there except for the music they pump into my brain. In addition, they seem extremely convenient to charge up. I still have not mastered the onboard controls ... but I have not needed them. I have not had occasion  to give these a real N/C test, but I'm looking forward to being able to fly again to do that. And I'll keep my Bose cans for that purpose, too. PS: My wife has been happy with her Bose N/C earbuds for years. Earlier today, I gave these to her to try while I took a nap. As soon as I woke up she told me she'd like a pair of her own. Ordered!\", \"I'm not an audiophile.  The AirPods are used for SirriusXM and some voice programming.  I do not find the sound quality to be better than my $45 pair of ear buds.  Maybe it is and I can't appreciate it so I gave it 5 stars for sound quality.  It's fine for me. Noise cancellation is a disappointment.  It's okay on subtle background noise but it just doesn't get certain sounds.  Example - a chain saw about a block away sounded almost the same with or without.  It almost cancels out my shop dust collector (71 db) which is pretty good.  The heater, which is no where near al loud is still quite audible, however.  There are other shop noises, like the chain saw, are barely cancelled.  The pods are not a replacement for hearing protection, but they are not advertised that way.  I could take it or leave it. Transparency mode is useful for talking to someone, but obnoxious if you were to leave it on, like while driving or walking (some review suggest this).  It picks up and amplifies too much of the noise.  The rain in the downspouts is an example.  That's all I hear if I'm near the house. I have tried the different sizes of the rubber inserts to make sure they fit and I'm pretty sure they do. Three stars because they do work.  They just don't work better than others in proportion to cost.\", 'I love the AirPods Pro. I like the compatibility with my apple products, the noise cancellation feature and transparency feature, and sound quality is crisp. A few notes: I had a bit of an issue connecting these to my MacBook Pro with Retina display, but what fixed that is selecting forget this device on my iPhone then trying to connect again on the MacBook. The ear tips stay in my ear 9/10, I use the smallest ear-tip and it falls out occasionally (may just be my ears, this obviously would vary from person to person). The noise cancellation feature isn’t 100% noise cancellation, but it is a significant difference from transparency and does block out I’d say like 80% of the noise around me. The battery life is great on these, I can use them for I’d say 6 hours straight, do a quick 15 minute charge in the case, then it’s good again. I was expecting it to die quickly, so I was pleasantly surprised. The sound quality on these are what you’d expect of Apple products. They are great sounding. I’m no audiophile, but these sound amazing compared to earbuds I’ve used previously and have great clarity. These are obviously pricey, but if you have the money and do not own any generation of AirPods I would definitely get these. If these aren’t in your budget, you can get the 1st or 2nd generation AirPods if you don’t already have them.', \"I'm a specs guys. Found it really difficult to spend any money on something like this but the sound upgrade in quality is worth it. While the battery life is not as long as the previous versions, I never found myself out of battery from listening to headphones 24/7 except when in the office. In that case I had only had them in for noise cancelling. Funny story a sales manager told me to turn them down once so she could continue ranting and raving while talking over everyone around her. Now that I have these noise cancelling head phones and get to work from home everyday until at least 2022 (fingers crossed) this won't ever be a problem anymore. They are great for blocking out sound from bathroom toilets flushing when hard at work tho in an office setting I don't feel I should be subjected to sitting directly near the toilets anyway. What can I say, whether blocking out rude sales managers or toilet flushing these are the best. Great for gaming too, I find myself x10 better when focused and not even noticing loud stomping, yelling, or other peoples phone conversations when I have these in.\", \"Love, Love, Love these.  We have tried so many headphones and buds, etc and nothing comes close to what these AirPods do. First, the noise canceling is so strong it blew away other bulky earphones we bought for airplane travel.  As for comfort - you'll forget they're even in your ear.  I have Wireless Jaybirds, the 2'nd gen Apple EarPods, and Bose wireless ear buds and these surpass them.  They arrived less than 24 hours after ordering for Father's Day gift but after sampling there they became a Mother's  Day Gift and the hubby ended up with the older model.  In addition - if you order on the apple site they charge extra if you want a wireless case to charge.  On Amazon they automatically come with that upgrade at a price  that's below Apples regular price.\", \"I bought these to wear at night to block out ambient noise (snoring). I have some over the ear headphones but they cannot be worn comfortably while sleeping. The Apple AirPods Pro have a great fit, and with some white noise playing and the noise cancellation feature, block out the snoring quite well. When used as regular headphones, the sound quality is great and I find myself using both modes (noise cancelling and non-noise cancelling) depending on the situation. When not it noise cancellation mode they let in the ambient sounds so you can hear vehicles, people etc. while still hearing the podcast or music. My only gripe is battery life. When in noise cancelling mode, they only last about 4 hours, which is not a full night's sleep. So sometimes I'll sleep all night no prob then others I'll get woken up by the beeps from the battery running out. Sometimes I'll throw them in their case for a quick charge while I use the bathroom and 20 or 30 percent will be enough to get me to morning. Overall great product.\", \"So not impressed so far.  Most likely will return them.  I have the original airpods.  Why the low review.  Well...these things just don't fit my ear well.  No matter which size i pick.  They either fall out (slide out) and actually hurt while in my ear.  For some reason the old air pods almost never fell out.  I really would like these to work, because I like being able to activate Siri without grabbing my phone.  But since they don't fit and easily slide out of my ear, the noise cancellation is pointless.  You have to have a sealed fit. As for the sound quality , noise cancellation, battery, etc...I have a pair of Bose NC, these just blow away the Air Pods Pro and are comfortable.  For airplanes, this is the only option in my opinion.  I guess for the size, they are quite powerful but...battery life with NC is only around 4 hours.  I really don't worry about charging the Bose. I think I might give the 2nd gen a try, since I think they do work with Siri.\", 'I have always loved the sound quality of the wired Apple headphones of the past and when Apple announced they were releasing a wireless bluetooth version of the headphones with the 1st generation airpods, I wasn\\'t sold immediately. I thought they would lack in the sound quality department and honestly, I was afraid they would fall out of my ears. When I finally took the plunge and paid the $150 for my first pair of airpods, I couldn\\'t believe I waited as long as I did. Not only was the sound quality great, the comfort and light weight feeling of them in my ear was awesome. Sometimes I would forget I was even wearing them. Needless to say, I became a huge fan of the airpods and would recommend them to anyone who was interested in buying them. Fast forward to the release of the Airpod Pros. I absolutely loved the idea of noise canceling airpods. As much as I wanted to get them, I refrained because my first generation airpods were still going strong. Well, I ended up losing the case for my airpods so it gave me an excuse to finally buy the airpod pros. First the things I love about these headphones. The sound quality is still top notch but not any different than the previous generation air pods. Where these airpods shine is with the noise canceling and transparency features. For an ear pod, the noise canceling is surprisingly good. When turned on, it almost feels as if your ears are being vacuum sealed and you can immediately tell that high pitched sounds around you become silent. The airpods also have a transparency mode that basically work as the opposite of noise canceling to allow noises to enter your ear so you don\\'t have to continually take the airpod out if someone is talking to you for example. Neither feature effects the sound quality of the airpods in a negative way. Although the sound features are great, there is two major flaws with these headphones. The first issue I have is the comfort. These airpods are nowhere near as comfortable or lightweight feeling as the previous generation airpods. This is largely due to the \"ear cushions?\" that were added to these airpods to assist with the noise canceling feature. I find my ears starting to hurt a bit after wearing these for a long period of time because of the pressure of these cushions. I feel this is a setback for the airpods because it basically defeats the purpose of the name \"airpod.\" I can definitely tell I\\'m wearing headphones the whole time. The other big issue I have with these headphones may just be with the ones I purchased but it’s probably the most annoying one since these are not cheap headphones. The best way I can describe this issue is that the left airpod, especially when it’s in transparency mode, has a slight static sound whenever I speak at a higher tone on a phone call or even when they are just in my ear with nothing playing. It’s almost like the sound a busted stereo or car speaker makes or when there is a loose wire on a speaker and you wiggle the wire and it makes a static sound. I’m not sure why it started doing this but it is really frustrating since I’ve only had these airpods for a few months. Again, this may just be an issue with my airpods but it is the main reason I\\'ve given this product 3 stars.', 'As a long time Apple user, I was very excited for these headphones. For a wireless Bluetooth set of earbuds, the sound is quite good. The noise canceling works really well when there’s background noise, especially in the world of virtual meetings. I can seamlessly use the AirPods between my iPad, MacBook Pro, iPhone, and spin bike without much configuration. Unfortunately, despite these great features, the two big issues that plague the AirPods Pro our battery life and fit. In regards to battery life, I only got a couple hours out of these. Luckily, they give you notification when the battery is running low, but not very useful for a long day of meetings or in areas where you won’t be able to charge regularly when working out. Despite changing the Tips multiple times and experimenting with various sizes, I find that they slide out of my ears very easily. If I bend over or get quite sweaty, it’s predictable that they will fall out. I have had them fall out in the middle of a run or a spin class on a few occasions. So, now I essentially use these at my desk for meetings or is it back up to my other earbuds. I have found Beats (by Apple) PowerBeats Pro to have a lot of functionality of the AirPods, with much longer battery life and hooks that keep them from falling out of the ears. The noise canceling of the AirPods Pro is superior, but the PowerBeats Are just simply a fantastic sounding, long lasting, comfortable set of headphones that stay in place. If I had to do over again, I would’ve skipped the AirPods Pro, and went straight for the PowerBeats. But, these little earbuds are still used frequently for less active activities.', 'Look at the picture I included.... can you tell that one of them went swimming in a bucket of paint?  Nope, you can’t because these wonderful little earbuds are waterproof. I was leaning over the paint bucket while painting my bathroom and the left earbud fell out right into the very full bucket. The harder I tried to get it out, the deeper it went into the paint. I got it out, said a little prayer and washed it off. No damage or change in the sound quality or noise canceling function. As for the noise canceling ability, it really does work well. It doesn’t completely block EVERYTHING, but it did allow me to work in the same room as my children who are learning virtually without headphones.  It also allowed me to listen to a book while the roomba vacuumed around me. It also has the cool function of allowing more outside sound in, if you need it. The battery life is pretty standard of Apple AirPods, around 4 hours on a full charge. I am so thrilled with the AirPod Pro. They are so with the price and are definitely a step up from the original AirPods.', '... to buy additional, third-party ear pieces. These things HURT when wearing with the OEM ones. They pop out constantly and simply don\\'t fit. As is the case with so many Apple products, they just don\\'t seem to quite get it right. Not shipping enough RAM with their computers, not enough storage with their phones, short battery life, what have you. AirPods Pro is yet another case of \"almost, not quite.\" I\\'m almost certain this is on purpose, so you have to either buy third-party add-ons, more Apple dongles, or pay through the nose for custom configurations. I have a pair of very expensive Shure in-ears that fit fine, so I know it\\'s not me. I do have small ear canals, however other products seem to fit, but not Apple\\'s. Nooo, not Apple\\'s. On the plus side, the integration with iOS is top-notch and the sound quality is pretty good, even hanging halfway out of my ears, as these do. I\\'d love to experience the full richness of the sound these produce, but alas, I had to return them. What a pity.', \"Bought my pair on January 27th of this year. I struggled with the ear sizes since then. I thought it was user error for a long time so didn't return them in time. SOUND QUALITY: The listening modes are fascinating but for $250 it's not worth it. ------By the end of the first day I knew the headphones weren't worth it but because they're ~Airpod Pros~ I kept trying them out. The noise cancelling is pretty cool experience. Every so often I'm nicely caught off guard because what I'm listening to can sound like it's in the same room as me. DURABILITY: These constantly fell out of my ears and because of this, they've taken a consistent falls. Within a 2 months the left ears began giving me problems bc one of these falls.  Even outside of the falls the earbuds are nice, and ever so slightly underwhelming, and the case is a nice heavy weight with a good magnetic closing mechanism. CONCLUSION: If you have the money to spend and enjoy sound I would suggest giving it a try. Return them if they don't fit. If the Airpod Pros are outside of your budget I promise that you're not missing out on too much.\", 'They kept falling out of my ear, but they come with 3 different sizes of earbuds. Once I replaced the buds that came on them with the small ones I’ve had no problems with them falling out at all. The noise cancelling is really good, I like that I can still hear voices, the forklifts beeping at me, and loud sounds I need to stay safe, but the drum of my work environment AC etc. is all gone. So far haven’t had a problem at all with battery life. They’re so convenient to use with the IPhone I couldn’t be more pleased. I’ve also called my friend while in the grocery store, he said he couldn’t hear any of the sounds around me and could hear me fine, so they’re good for phone calls My only complaint is that you can’t adjust volume with them. I wish you could, you have to use your phone.', \"If these were $150, I'd say they were absolutely worth it and everybody should buy them, no questions asked. If they were $200, I'd say that's a fair price for what you are getting. At $250 I think it's a bit of a stretch for some, however, I am glad I bought them. These Airpods replaced my Sony MDRXB50AP which are not wireless. I also have some wireless earbuds that I never used because I didn't think they were loud enough and the looks weren't that great in my opinion (Soundmoov 316T). Airpods Review: Pros: - Noise cancelling works much much better than expected. - Sound quality compared to any of my previous earbuds is also much much clearer. - Much louder than my previous wireless earbuds (but not quite as loud as the wired Sony's, but close) - Siri automatically reads any messages received (very helpful IMO) - Siri is easy to use - Pairs automatically (other wireless buds also connect automatically, but it's sometimes not as fast/seamless) - Findmyiphone can show you where they were last connected. (This feature could be improved, however, it's still better than nothing + if they are connected and lost in nearby you can make them play a sound so that you can more easily find them) - Bluetooth is strong. I can be pretty far away from my phone, even if I'm outside and the phone is left inside, I can go farther than expected. Cons: - Bass is not nearly as good as my Sony's. I don't know what people are talking about when they are impressed by the Airpod's bass... it's trash. Though, to be fair I think the improvement in sound quality makes up for this and more. - I think these are about $50 overpriced but this is subjective.\", 'The key feature that made me get AirPod pros was the transparency mode  because I work in people’s homes and I work with my hand I need to use  earbuds to answer my phone but they would act like ear plugs ,so when I tried the transparency mode it was like magic but the magic was short lived the noise cancellation and transparency mode stopped working.but overall they have good clear sound not a lot of bass and they stay in your ear better than most ear buds ,I would strongly suggest getting one of those cords that holds your AirPods around your neck because you well forget that they are in your ear and you will lose one I did 3 time lucky for me my wife is a good detective and found them every time so now I make sure to tie them up every time .oh on the noise cancellation it is a known defect on Olson’s AirPods  I have an appointment with the Geek squad they are to determine if they will replace them or not so if they don’t I will definitely give a different review so people will be aware.', \"No multipoint so constantly have to switch between PC & iphone.  It is also not quicker than 85t to connect to iphone.  Jabra 85t connects just as fast to iphone as Air Pod Pros and since it has multipoint it stays connected to both PC & iphone so saves me the frustration of having to reconnect to iphone when connected to PC & vice versa.  It is also not as comfortable as 85t.  The hard plastic of Air Pod Pros is noticeable in your ears & uncomfortable during long periods.  Even after I take them off I catch myself reaching to my ear to pull them off even though I already did because you can still sense the uncomfortable pressure.  They also tend to wiggle out & just fall off without much warning.  The 85t's just stay in & you don't notice them. The noise canceling is a wash between these and 85t.  They are both good.  Same for mic.  85t has better sound quality.  I also love the Jabra app.  The Air Pod Pros don't come with app for iphone so you can't adjust the level of ANC or anything really.  You either like it or not.  I was frustrated with the Air Pod Pros given my high expectations based on price & reviews.  Jabra Elite 85t are the clear winner for my use case in an office with both PC & iphone.  I also use them outside of work for air travel, listening to youtube, radio, podcasts etc. on both iphone & ipad.\", 'I like that you can stick a very tiny object in your ear and get great sound from it. After listening to everything from Billie eilish to classical music I’m impressed with the sound from something so small. However my Sennheiser and Mpow headphones blow them away. Headphones are so much better sounding, but these are so small that you almost don’t care that they aren’t as good as headphones. I’ve listened to Samsung’s best earbuds and some other cheap ear buds and these are really way better, if you want great sound get headphones but if you want small good sound get earbuds, I don’t think there will ever be ear buds as good sounding as headphones  but then again it’s a lot cooler going out in public with inconspicuous ear buds rather than headphones. All in all I really like these and will buy a pair for my wife.', \"Bluetooth noise cancellation earbuds provides convenience at the cost of audio quality. There is simply no way there are going to beat a good pair of wired headphones. But even I was surprised by just had bad these were. IF you turn off noise cancellation you could get about 85% of the sound quality of my cheap $9 Hypergear earbuds and 70% of my Bowers & Wilkins C5 Series 2.  The active noise cancellation will literally destroy your high end and while EQ could help somewhat it simply can't bring back what is not there. If you are looking for social status or just like helping Apple makes a few more billion then by all means get these. The fit and comfort is outstanding. If you are looking to listen to some good music get a decent pair of wired headphones.\", \"Let me begin by saying I absolutely loved my original AirPods. I truly wish I had just purchased another pair instead of the moving to the AirPods Pro. First the good things. The battery life is great and very competitive in the market. The noise cancellation and sound quality TECHNOLOGY are also great! However, these qualities are immediately compromised as these move and shift in your ears after about 5-10 minutes of sitting still and much more quickly with movement which drastically changes what you hear. I have even tried all three ear fittings. This is assuming you place them correctly into your ears in the first place. You need to play around and wiggle into place each time you put them in to find the correct positioning... and then do it all over again a short time later. For whatever reason, it takes an act of congress for my AirPods Pro pair to connect to my MacBook and they have yet to connect to our Apple TV. After troubleshooting, I did everything Apple and the internet told me. I run the latest updates, placed AirPods in the in the charger and reset them etc. I have no issue with them connecting to my iPhone. For what it's worth, the Pros are a true inconvenience. I still have my other AirPods which I may go back to permanently and cut my loss on these.\", 'After having owned the original AirPods and absolutely loving them, these were a profound disappointment. I’ll be honest, at first they seemed like a resounding improvement, both with sound quality, and functionality. Needless to say I’m back to using my old ones which still work great. The first generation was avant guard. I know they didn’t work properly with everyone’s ear archetype, but even when they felt they may fall out, they never did. The next generation although ostensibly brandishing new features (noise cancelation), would constantly fall out of my ear. What’s atrocious is the communication with the iPhone. I found myself constantly pressing “forget device” and paring them back up so when opened, it would display the battery level. Toward the end of their ephemeral life ( yes they just don’t work anymore after only 8 months) they were wheezing and people could not hear me clearly. The last glitch before they became feckless was their inability to charge in sync. I can’t share how many times the next day I would plug them in my ear right before a workout and I would hear the deathly twinkle sound that the right ear bud was imminently about to die. My guess is Apple needed something new, threw in some noise cancelation feature, and redesigned them because that’s how they make money. I have owned apple products since before they were cool, and I always thought they would never sacrifice quality for flash and speed, but these air buds confound that sentiment. No way should close to $200 ear buds be rendered useless in 8 months, that’s just a swindle.', 'Well, I\\'ve had a bumpy ride with Airpods Pro, but let me explain. I first purchased APP when they first came out. There was a distortion problem that arose after a couple of months. My buddy had the same problem. We both work in recording studios and listen to our finished work on ear buds because that\\'s what \"the public\" will do. Anyway, we found out that it was a manufacturing defect in the first generation. I was going to send them back to Apple, but they got stolen. So then I got a \"refurbished\" set on eBay. BIG MISTAKE. And I did this twice. So I just decided to buy a new pair. They\\'re perfect now! I did also get some \"memory foam\" inserts because they just never would stay in my ears correctly using the stock Apple inserts. I really think that for balanced sound and functionality Airpods Pro are my favorite. Thanks.', \"First of all great sound and the noise cancellation works well.  Of course it slides right into the apple eco-system and connects effortlessly to the iphone and apple watch.  Siri even mostly understands me.  The Pods do fall out of my ears with more frequency than I'm comfortable with, especially since I like to wear them jogging and cycling. There are add on products out there to mitigate the danger.  I use and recomend the AhaStyle.  My biggest complaint is that I can't answer phone calls by squeezing or tapping the AirPod, or even asking Siri to answer the phone.  I  either have to answer on my iPhone or Apple Watch.  This is mainly a pain when I'm cycling.  I guess I've had cheaper bluetooth pods that you can answer by tapping the pod and it seems like something apple could easily provide. It might be nice to have siri anounce whose calling.  Although maybe that's already available through some iPhone setting.  Other than that complaint I'm pretty happy.\", 'I ordered the AirPods Pro in mid March.  For the first ten weeks or so of use, I was very pleased with the quality of sound, the noise cancellation and the other features.  Then the left ear bud started dropping the Bluetooth connection or losing charge, sometimes with the charge disappearing while the bud was in the charging case.  I tried the various Apple and YouTube suggestions re cleaning the contact points on the bud and inside the case.  I tried disconnecting the AirPods Pro from my iPhone and reconnecting.  These measures all worked, but the effect was short lived.  I was hassling with the device on a daily basis.  A few days ago after much annoyance and waiting on-hold, I was able to speak to an Apple rep.  A new left earbud is on its way.  However, given the lack of success others have reported after replacing one earbud, I am not feeling optimistic.  I’m sorry I bought the AirPods Pro.  I’d much rather get my money back.  For the price, these wireless earbuds should be far more reliable.  Too late to return them to Amazon now, of course.  Save yourself a lot of grief and explore alternative wireless listening options.', \"When I start to look for some new headphones I did my research. Between theses and the Beats Pro. Every video I watch tent to point towards the AirPods. I already own a pair of Bose QC35 wireless headphones (awesome product see my review). The problem was over the ear headphones after awhile get tried to ware. So I got me some Pros. Where can I begin? They are awesome! (your probably thinking coming from an Apple Head they can't do anything wrong believe it or not I own a pair of Samsung Buds and return them). Connected to all my Apple products no problem. When I first took them out of the box I question how am i going to charge them? Took me a minute to learn that you can use your phone cable. Great sound! I mow the yard the other day listening to my music and could barely hear the mower. Also, when am listening on iMac I can walk around my whole house with not losing connection. Get a great charge at work. Listen to them put them in the charger at break and they are good to go till next break! Use them as my phone sounded great. I wish I could review everything they can do but that would be a novel! I think I caught what most people will use them for. If you are going to for some great headphones I know they are a bit high price, but well worth it. Well at lease to me! Want a good pair of earbuds PROs are the best!\", \"This was my first time purchasing quality higher priced earbuds..I had tried cheaper bluetooth earbuds and they were all garbage. These are fantastic!! Within seconds of opening the case, they are automatically paired, and ready to be used. Yesterday at work I was in an upstairs office, and my phone was about 40meters away down in my shop, phone rang and I panicked because the phone was not in my pocket. I simply touched the earbuds to answer and had a clear call come through...the distance on these is amazing!! As for the levels of noise cancel...love all 3! These really do function quite well...little on the pricy side for me, but worth the purchase if you are on your phone at work a lot. I usually have 1 or both in my ears all day and feel no discomfort at all...just remember fellas..if you move your arm across your head as to wipe away sweat...you'll likely dislodge an earbud if they're in...the arm naturally swipes the ear, don't wanna knock em out of your ear ;) I most definitely recommend this product!\", \"I just got these a couple of weeks ago and really surprised at how poorly they fit and how easily they fall out.  I mainly use them at the gym and working in the yard but there is always this sense that they are about to fall out and half the time they do.  Never wear these while standing in front of the toilet. I did buy some silicone covers that solve the problem but of course the case won't close with them on so I have to put them on and take them off for every use.  It's just incredible that Apple does such a poor job in making earbuds that actually work in the real world.  I've always disliked the design of Apple earbuds but thought that the airpods pro would be a fix for that but it isn't. The sound is fine, noise cancelling is fine but integration with iphone is probably best feature for me.  I was using a pair of cheap wireless buds before and they just didn't work as seamlessly as these. It's just ridiculous for users to have to buy an aftermarket product to use these.\", 'I think the sound quality of these things is outstanding.  I have a pair of wired over the ear Bose quiet comforts and these are comparable in both their sound quality and noise cancellation.  Base response is the best I have had with ear buds (both wired or wireless).  The sound quality also applies to phone conversations .  I bought these to support Teleworking during the pandemic and know one knows that I am talking over the head phones, they are that good.  On particularly busy days I have to be mindful of the battery levels but it has rarely impacted me negatively.  Re-charging doesn\\'t take long.  I did have to swap out the ear tip for a larger one in my right ear before I got a satisfactory ear tip test.  If you haven\\'t done this I recommend it (go to blue tooth and hit the \"i\" button this opens a separate menu where you can select the ear tip fit test).  I\\'ve also used these a bunch for yard work, the lack of the \"tether\" to my phone is awesome and makes for trouble free listening, the noise cancelling drowns out the lawnmower, weed eater, pressure washer, blower, whatever nicely so all you get is good music without the noise.  Overall really impressed with these and would recommend them.', \"CONS: Sound quality is not great. My 39.00 Chinese earbuds sound every bit as good if not better than these. Battery life is pretty poor. Shortest of all I've tried to far. I did find that the Chinese earbud overall battery life is not great. ie they weren't holding a charge after 10mos or so. I bought the apple ones thinking the batteries would be better quality. Short term, no.. Long term, we'll see. Additionally, they dont feel secure in my ears and I have found one lying in the dirt at my feet several times now. Just ordered foam ear tips for another $30 (which is insulting) but hope they help. PROS. Hmmm. Well, I do like the charging case; thought I would hate it but its actually functionally handy. I also like how they (most of the time)  just turn and connect on when I put them in. I like SIRI reading my messages although she's hit and miss. Not all messages are read. I like how Siri tells you who is calling and whether you want to answer it. So, basically, I like the SIRI integration and I think it is the best feature of these earbuds; certainly the sound quality is not. I did buy a second pair for my wife and she likes them and has no problems with them staying in. CONCLUSION: Not worth 200 bones IMO but they are a must have if you're caught in the Apple Ecosystem\", \"Where do I even start. These AirPods are probably one of the most impressive pieces of design I've ever seen. They are so much better than the original AirPods. The $100 price difference is too low - I would've paid more for these features if I knew how good they were. 1. Transparency Mode. This is amazing. Lets you hear more than you can physically hear with your ears blocked. You can listen to music and still hear the coworkers next to you. You can walk across the street and hear oncoming traffic (you should still look both ways). You can go to the gym and listen to music while not being completely closed off from the rest of the gym. It literally flows the outside sound into your ear. So even with your ears completely sealed off with the earbuds, you can hear better than you would if you used the original airpods. 2. Noise cancelling. In my opinion, when Apple does something they do it right. The moment noise cancelling turns on it sounds like you're in your own world. The difference is not slight or somewhat there.. it's staggering. I can't even hear myself swallow food or chew. I can't hear myself run. I can't hear anything except my music. 3. Squeeze instead of tap. The airpod pro gestures are really great. Tapping was nice but it was gimmicky and it didn't work perfectly. I frequently needed to tap twice to get things to work. Sometimes I tapped too many times. Squeezing is more deliberate. it makes it so you know what you're doing and you can feel exactly what the headphones are responding to. It makes the gestures so much more reliable. 4. Sound quality! I compared these headphones with my pair of wired V-MODA Zn's. If you don't know of that brand, it's a medium-priced luxury audiophile pair of headphones. It's wired, so it will naturally be able to achieve better sound quality than Bluetooth. These headphones exceed the sound quality of any BEATS headphones you can find. In comparison to the AirPods, I would say that AirPods are only slightly lower in quality. That is an incredible achievement, because for me the Zn's are the pinnacle of sound for anything under $300. So I would say that the sound quality is pretty damn amazing. All in all, this is a luxury item. You don't NEED these features, but when you get these earphones you're going to have an incredible time.\", 'I like the fact that the pods are so small, but why make them so slippery.  I’ve already accidentally dropped them twice, and the plastic does not take falls well.  They are all scratched and nicked up.  The buds for some reason doesn’t provide a good seal in my ears, the medium  and large seems to slip out and the small doesn’t provide a god seal according to the test on the iPhone.  Not worth the MSRP in my opinion', 'Not impressed. Have been using ‘classic’ Airpods till now and anticipated a decent uplift in audio quality based on the reviews of the ‘Pros’. Not so much - it is a little better, but not worth the jump. Noise cancelling is so-so. If you are used to either Bose or Sony cans which cancel 80% of the droning noise in an airplane, these get to 30% at best. It is even hard to tell the difference between it being turned on and off. Besides that, they are not as easy to handle and plug in your ears as the 1st and 2nd generation. Not recommended. Hopefully the next generation will be better. Update: 4 months in now, opinion mostly unchanged - the first generation was genius, the second generation a slight improvement. The Pros just don\\'t have that same level of polish. I am still confused every time which \"beep\" indicates whether you are in transparancy mode, normal or noise cancelling. The squeeze technique remains kind of weird. A touch / slide option to adjust the volume would have been the most useful thing they could have added, but didn\\'t.  Getting them out of the case remains a bit of a trick (rotate them slightly). If you drop the case, the pods fall out (unlike the original one).  It just all feels a little un-Apple and a bit of a rushed product.  When switching to the normal ones (when the battery of these things is empty again), I am always amazed how \"airy\" they feel in your ears, compared to the Pros that plug in your ear canal.', 'I was skeptical on these since they came out but I love them now and don’t regret them. They went on sale for $200 so I decided to try and if not I would’ve returned them. After using them and the features I absolutely love the noise canceling. Even without music playing it still muffles surrounding noise. I didn’t even notice someone talking to me a few feet away at first with noise cancellation on. The transparency feature is great as well if you do want to hear background noise. I like the smaller size compared to the regular airpods. Only issue is that i can’t use them to change the volume but it’s not that big of a deal personally as I was already accustomed to it with the regular airpods. They are probably the best all around Bluetooth airpods out.  Sound quality even sounds better in my opinion. Charging case is also automatically wireless without having to pay extra like the regular airpods. A big issue I had with the regular airpods was comfortability and how well they stayed in my ear. But not with these. They’re MUCH more comfortable and really stay in your ear. The battery life could be better but they still last long and charge FAST. I can honestly say they are worth it if you are looking to upgrade.', 'These are so worth the price.  The quality is amazing, the sound and noise cancellation is the best, the battery life is impressive.  The 4 star rating instead of 5 star is due to greedy Apple not including the 18watt USB-C square plug with these.  You get the USB-C cord but no square plug in for these high priced Air Pods (and a USB-C square plug from a MACbook is too high wattage/not recommended).', \"I've had the 1st Gen AirPods since they were released and the battery is finally giving out. Since getting these, I'm mostly unimpressed, and will be returning these for regular AirPods. 1. I'm not commuting anymore, and don't have NYC noise to contend with, so the noise cancelling is mostly useless for me. However, the ones I received had older firmware. This meant stronger noise cancellation that I was really impressed with. Apple lessened the noise cancellation levels to maintain the integrity of the battery (supposedly), but if Apple had maintained the same levels with the new firmware, maybe it'd be worth it. 2. It seems the new firmware has also changed the way it fades my music in/out while I use a workout timer (as in it no longer fades, and instead just pauses my music). It's barely been a week, and I've had to move to playing music on my iPad so I can keep time with my iPhone. Annoying and unnecessary. 3. Working out with these is a lot more frustrating than it should be. Either the buds fall out a lot easier than my old AirPods (different bud sizes don't help), or the accelerometer is a lot more sensitive. A slight change in positioning will end the noise cancellation (only works with both buds in place), pause the music, and even cause the bud to fall out. (I think the shorter stem weakens the grip here.) 4. I've noticed much more bluetooth interference with these. After an hour or so of continued use, regardless of my phone's proximity (or iPad, computer, or Apple TV - I tried everything) to my headphones, my media will start to skip and the bluetooth connection becomes unstable. I do not have this issue with other brand new bluetooth devices I use. 5. The battery life is technically a half hour less than my original AirPods so :/ Overall, I was happy with my original AirPods, and don't see the appeal (or proper functionality) of these extra features. If you, like me, just need to replace the decent AirPods you already own, get the Gen 2.\", \"It seems like the plebs don't understand active noise cancelation.  For some reason, the average, work-a-day, degenerate, trough-eating, deplorable, resistance/trump-voting norms don't seem to get that it isn't a magic potion that eliminates all the sound that you don't like at the moment.  Teasing aside, all noise cancelation works by detecting sound with a normal, repetitive aural pattern, like an airplane engine or an air conditioner, a lawn mower, etc.  It doesn't cancel all outside sound, like voices or other intermittent sound that doesn't conform to a regular, predictable pattern.  Given that knowledge, I think these headphones do the best that is physically possible from an IEM headphone.  Of course, over-the-ear headphones will insulate more outside sound, but for portable headphones these work in a close to optimal manner.  If you are use them right and fit them correctly (some ear types may just not conform, but for most they seem to work well) they have good isolation, noise cancelation, excellent sound, good fit, and the functionality is industry leading, especially when when used with apple devices.\", \"First I'd like to thank Amazon for the amazing speed at which this item was delivered in these difficult times. They said overnight by 8am, they meant it! 1st. I bought these as a replacement for my Airpod gen2 wireless charging. The left bud died after only a year worth of everyday use. Now then I gave these 5 stars up front, because the speedy delivery time, the fact that they are new, not used and the genuine article. They came mostly charged, went into pairing mode as soon as I opened the case. Mated seamlessly with my Galaxy s20 plus and Airbattery app. The sound isolation works fairly effectively. Low end to mid range noise is totally filtered out. High end piercing noise, not so much. I love the fact that the tap feature is gone! It only worked when it felt like it. These you just squeeze the stem which is mercifully much shorter than the Airpods. Squeeze once to pause or answer calls. Twice tonskip a track. 3 times to backtrack. Squeeze and hold to turn on of noise cancelation. Aound quality is much better as well. Not Bose, but pretty good.  These will mainly be used for audiobook listening one bud at a time anyway, so longer battery life, will be good enough for music and movies until Bose finally releases their earbuds 500's! Will update as necessary. Thx.\", 'It wanted to like these, the noise cancelation works well, but these do not fit my ear no matter what tip I used. They just fall out after a minute or two and when they are in the ear they are painful. Also the sound quality, while just ok, does not match the price point. I bought an ear hook accessory that slips over the headset to help hold them in the ear. These did work but the Airpods are still uncomfortable. However these was not a viable solution since the carrying case does not close with this type of accessory and there is no way to turn off the Airpods with them in the case with the lid open. Since I need to connect to other devices for various reasons this just leads to having to remove/re-attach the ear hooks multiple times per day. In the end I just gave them away, complete waste of money.', '', 'I bought these from the wharehouse and they are defective 😏 this would be the first defective item I have purchased from the wharehouse  The sound was great,  however, They wouldn’t stay connected to my Iphone.  Transcript was awful, and only after 3 days  they started to buzz loudly in my ear,, The battery life is not as good as my AirPods second generation and it is supposed to surpass them,,, overall this item was not a good buy this time. 👍Second pair from the warehouse,  I have had for over a week now all seems well so far 😁 I like the way they sound, noise  canceling is great,, they will replace ear plugs at work I work at the airport lots of loud to contend with,  I am glad I decided to give it another try, I have bought several things from the wharehouse and all have been well,  I will continue to do so.. thanks Amazon', 'Y’all the noise cancellation is amazing. I can’t hear my son yelling, playing, his iPad or the loud noises he is making with it on. I am able to work at home without being distracted. I am only turning that feature on when my husband is here in charge of him obviously. It is forcing him to pretend I am really not physically here too so he doesn’t venture outside leaving my son in here with me. Finally working without feeling so stressed out! It also has a transparency mode that lets the noise in so I can still wear them when I am trying to work and I am alone with my son. I never imagined I would be one to pay so much for ear phones but I did and I think they were worth the investment! As far as comfort, I actually forget they are in my ears, which has never happened. I fell asleep with one in my ear last night. It was not comfy in the ear that was on the pillow when I was laying on my side, but I did not notice it in the other ear. They also come with 3 different sized tips to make sure you can get the best fit. Then you run a test on your device and it tells you if the ones you currently have on them is the best fit possible. The charging case is amazing. They charge in the case wirelessly in like 15 minutes as long as you have the case fully charged before you put them inside. I am super impressed and it takes a lot to impress me with gadgets like this. I think it is so cool they stop playing whatever you are listening to automatically when you take one out of your ear and then it automatically resumes when you put it back in your ear.', 'I use them every day. 100% worth it for me. I can’t imagine not having them. If you need them for music recording and live monitoring, the latency will be too much for it to be usable for that regard, but any wireless earbud will have that problem, I’m guessing. So for that specific use case, they won’t be as good as say a pair of over-ear headphones like Audio Technica ATH-M50s, in my experience, BUT, they’re great for anything else. They’re small and they’re wireless, and they sound good. So that checks all the boxes for what I needed them for. Oh and the noise canceling is AMAZING! I definitely would buy them again in the future.', 'Look, I’m not an apple fan. In fact I borderline despise the company. That being said, the headphone have absolutely blow me away with how great they are. The sound is clear and is balanced very well. I use these at work everyday. They last about 6 hours. When they get to 10% battery they make a noise. When I hesr that noise I take one bud out and charge it and keep the other in my ear. By the time the one in my ear dies (45mins or so) the one charging is at around 50%. So i switch and charge, and take it out after 30 minutes of charging. I never stop having music. Absolutely love it. The noise canceling is a great feature. It is clearly not going to be as good as an over the ear headset, but that is understandable since this is a tiny piece that goes in your ear. We just had a daughter and this feature has saved my sanity during the infancy stage. If you are on the fence, I would highly recommend you pulling the trigger on these. Great product.', \"Tried these with my iPhone 11. Quite compatible. They stay in my ears without trouble. Call quality is fine. No problem. My issue is with the sound. Music is blah. There is no bass, or any sparkle to the sound. It's just not lively. I can't understand why other reviews don't speak to this issue. Perhaps since they are so easy to use, the sound quality and music quality just don't matter. Perhaps it's just because it's Apple. I know that there is an equalizer on the iPhone but that seems to work only with Apple Music. I compared the Pros with the Sony XM3s and there is no comparison in the sound quality. The Sonys win by many miles. I use Spinfit 360 tips and have no problems with them staying in my ears, and they are comfortable. They also have an app that allows for wonderful EQ adjustments. The Sony call quality is fine. Calls are clear on both ends with a new firmware update. All in all, the sound quality of the Pros is seriously lacking. If your concerned about sound and  music quality, these are not the ones to get. Many things good about the Pros. Lacking sound quality is its biggest shortcoming. 3.5 stars.\", \"I'm surprised to see so many glowing reviews... For my part, I find that the sound quality of these headphones leaves much to be desired -- especially when one considers how much they are being sold for.  But the sound is unimpressive and problematic at times -- for example, I find the treble to be shrill and brittle in places.  In fact, I think that a couple of headphones in the $30-50 range have superior sound to these AirPods.  Also, there is a faint whisper of static in the background in transparency mode, as if the external microphone is running interference; it is subtle and likely not noticed by most listeners, but I can hear it (I suppose it's possible that my AirPods are defective on this score).  Another possible irritant for prospective users involves the play/pause button: because the button is designed in such a way that there is no obvious indication that the button has been activated, and because there is a delay (typical of wireless headphones) between pressing the button and having your music begin/pause, there is an inevitable moment of doubt and uncertainty every time you use the button.  For it is not immediately clear if the button has been pressed properly.  In opting for a sleek and sexy design, the engineers failed to consider the lived experience of actually using the device.  I should also mention that the headphones do not come with much instruction, and those instructions I did find on the Apple support page are, as of this writing, inadequate and unclear at times.  (I am left with the sense that Apple is too hip to be helpful.) In sum, if you care about good sound quality and good value, you should think twice before making this purchase.  You are primarily paying for the brand.  The AirPods have some good features, but the emperor, if not completely naked, is scantily clad at best.\", \"Wow! About a year ago I purchased the standard AirPods 2, despite being a bit skeptical I would actually use them regularly. Within a week I had changed my mind, as having these tiny imperceptible earbuds to play music and talk on the phone without the hassle of wires was a complete game-changer. Still, there were downsides. They allowed lots of external noise through, and the audio quality wasn't exactly breathtaking. The AirPod's Pro have built on the foundation of the original design and made it ten times better. They're smaller, stay in the ears better, and sound great for earbuds (though nothing will compare to a good set of headphones). The noise-cancellation is my favorite feature. Sometimes I have them in at work without music playing at all just to drown out the various noises and humming of machinery. Putting them in and suddenly experiencing quiet has provided me with a profound sense of calm when I needed it. Transparency mode is great for when you need to focus on the world. There are some of the occassional pairing bugs, mono sound bugs, and other weird things that I also experienced with the original Airpods. I hope Apple fixes these issues through software updates.\", \"I have tried many earbuds over the years, and could not use them longer than five minutes. They're either uncomfortable or fall out easily or both. Set up was so easy I was using them before I had time to be skeptical. These are very comfortable and I have no issues with them fitting or falling out. Obviously they are tiny, and can't match the range of a set of headphones. Let's  be real. But I can't wear headphones for an hour without getting uncomfortable. These are perfect for my needs. The noise cancellation works great around the house. The  transparency feature works really well when I have company. If you're content with what they do: provide a comfortable way to listen to music while working, reading etc then you will be pleased with these. I certainly am. As to battery life, you also have to be realistic in your expectations. The charging case is a great idea, so you can recharge them during the day. But these have a tiny battery, and it isn't going to last a long  time. You also need to understand that the batteries will not last forever. Several years, depending on use, but no batteries are forever.\", 'I have used my \"regular\" AirPods for many years. When these went on sale for Prime Day, I decided to *treat myself* and splurge on a new pair of Pros. Wow, I am so glad I did! The sound quality is amazing, especially when coupled with the noise cancelling feature and the new \"spatial audio\" songs on Apple Music. It is a very immersive musical experience. I also find the earpieces to be more comfortable than my prior AirPods. They stayed in very well during my ~1 hour outdoor walk in the heat yesterday. It was convenient to have Siri read new texts to me as they arrived, and I was able to easily respond simply by speaking. This kept me from having to dig my phone out of my pocket during my walk. Also, the noise cancelling feature works great by itself. I am so glad I upgraded!', \"These are superb earphones and what I think is the defacto standard in truly wireless earphones. The sound quality is great, coming from the bass heavier Bose Soundsport. These definitely sound great when you're on the go and in a noisy environment. The noise cancellation is good, but not Bose QuietComfort 35 (Over ear headphones) great. You do have to take this fact as a grain of salt, because once you see how tiny the AirPods Pro are, you'll be surprised at how these tiny sets of earphones can deliver such a good noise cancellation in a tiny form factor. In addition to the noise cancellation and sound quality, the battery life is great considering at just how tiny these are. I wish other competitors would offer better battery life in a tinier form factor. The size of the pods are just stupendously small, I would consider that as a pro and a con. In relation to its size, the battery life is still great, I'm able to go three days without having to charge these with varying light to heavy usage and charging them is quick even though they don't support USB Type-C power delivery. The only caveat to this product I would say is definitely the ways to charge it. Although it does come with a wireless charging case, I much prefer to charge them using a cable. Unfortunately these carry the proprietary lightning connector so you'd have to carry a USB Type-C cable and a lightning to USB Type-C cable too. As a person that used to only carry USB Type C cables, now I have to carry two types of cables for my iPhone and iPad Pro. Fresh off the box, you'll also notice you only get a charging cable but no charging brick. If you are always on the go in a noisy environment (like NYC, etc.) and like to backpack light, these earphones are totally a thumbs up from me. Just don't be clumsy, these are tiny and NOT easy to fall out BUT try not to drop them when you're trying to put them in or take them out.\", 'First off let me be specific as to the use. I have a significant other who snores (and yes we do C-pap etc) but I love her dearly so have tried a number of ear bud options. Mostly I tried to avoid big $$$ name brand solutions but got a pair of these refurbished and glad I did. First, comfort they’re incredibly comfortable especially for sleeping in, Secondly, noise cancellation, call me skeptical but now a true believer. However they’re engineered they’re worth every penny. Sure battery life is only 4.5 hours but that’s with cancellation turned on. Getting another 75% recharge takes Only about 15 minutes. Getting the right fit makes an obvious benefit but achieving this wasn’t difficult. Yes some sounds still get through but it’s ‘noise cancellation’ not ‘elimination’. Bottom line - I’m back to sleeping next to a loved one the whole night through.', \"First time buying an apple product. It was advertised to be new with apple care+ bundle. Disappointed to see some dust on the silicon part of the earbuds as well as the inner case near the silicon. Anyway, glad to have earbuds highly rated by the public eventually. Went to an apple store, everything regular, common and normal. Nothing special. The delivery is not so good. It was great that they finally followed my delivery instructions and put the item in the place I mentioned in the instructions. However, the outer delivery box is too big for containing an airpods pro and the air bags which protect the item during delivery was partially damaged and thus the air pods pro shaked heavily in the outer delivery box. It's weird that they only protect a sensitive, not-cheap electronic with such thin air bag filler. I guess paper filler, foam filler or bubble wrap should have better protection and made the item stay in a fixed position inside the delivery box. Its smart automatic disconnection and connection feature is absolutely not smart when I used Android and Windows devices.\", 'It’s rare for me to get excited about a new piece of technology, but I was pretty excited when I finally decided to join the AirPod revolution. Took them out of the box and went to try to charge them... only to discover I couldn’t, because the charger is not included in the box. I am not the most tech-savvy 30 year old and I have an older iPhone that doesn’t use this strange new charging plug, so I don’t have the brick that fits the cord they included. I don’t have a wireless charger either, and the cord doesn’t fit in my Mac computer to charge. Now these are useless until I spend half an hour online trying to figure out what charger I need to buy, or else buy a wireless charger. On top of spending $200 for headphones, which already seemed a bit ridiculous and is why I waited so long to buy these. I like Apple products because I’m intimidated by technology and Apple usually makes their products easy to understand and use. There are anything but. I might just return them out of sheer annoyance.', \"I purchased these as an upgrade to my 2nd Gen AirPods because the AirPod Pros seemed to solve all my pain points regarding the regular AirPods. They actually cancelled environmental noise (a must for me as I commute through a loud busy city and subway system every day), and the silicone tips mean they actually stay in my ears. They work as advertised. However, due to Apple releasing a shoddy firmware update, they don't cancel noise nearly as well as when I first purchased them. Apple pulled the firmware update I have a few days after release, but those with the latest update have no way to revert back to prior versions. Therefore: I'm stuck (as is everyone else who got the update) with so-so ANC until they release another firmware. However, they do still have SOME ANC abilities, just not as good. Pros: - As with the regular AirPods, if you're already a part of the Apple ecosystem, they're a dream to pair and switching between devices is simple. - Call quality is excellent. For me, I take a lot of work calls through my phone and computer (Webex, Google Meet) and call quality is always fantastic - Fits and stays in ears - I'm one of the ones who's a huge fan of silicone tips and for me, the APPs stay in my ears far better than the regular AirPods - Decent -> Outstanding ANC depending on firmware version. I take BART daily and it is incredibly loud - between the noise of the train on the tracks, the fact that it's jam-packed with people during rush hour, and the subway car performers that bring their own speakers into the train car, it is LOUD. With the regular AirPods, I would have the volume cranked to max volume and still not be able to hear my music/podcast. When I first got the APP, with ANC on I could have my music at 50% volume and still hear. Now with the latest firmware that crippled the effectiveness of the ANC I need to crank the volume to 75-80% in order to still hear my music over the din. But, still, compared to the regular AirPods, it's no contest. I just wish the ANC performed as well as when I first bought the devices. Cons: - No way to adjust the ANC level - The fact that you can't revert to an older firmware version or choose if/when you update firmware, that means if Apple releases a bad update, you might get it and be stuck with it - Silicone tips fit my ears better and are comfortable, but not sure I could wear them all day - Battery level - my experience is that it's pretty close to 4.5 hours on a charge for the ear buds themselves, but I wish that was longer. I have the same complaint about the regular AirPods but I know that the technology isn't there yet for longer battery life. Mostly it just means these can't serve as my primary ANC headphones on longer flights. Which is a shame because I'd love to not have to bring my much larger over the ear ANC headphones on trips.\", \"After giving these a glowing review and 5 stars 3 days after I got them; I wanted to make sure that people know that fondness was shortlived. I am retuning them because the ear fit test stopped working first on the right one and then on both. There  is an audible buzz in my right earbud when I talk to Siri or on the phone and the noise cancelleation was sporadic (probably due to ear fit). Apple replaced right earbud to no avail... If I weren't a long-time Apple geek I wouldn't have kept them as long as I did. Powerbeats pro that I bought at same time are FANTASTIC, but have no active noise cancellation. Very disappointed customer and disenchanted with Apple Support for first time. I’ve had these for 3 or 4 days & have used them about 35 hours. My appreciation for them has grown steadily. I had some trouble with the fit early on (they would pass the seal test,but were not stable in my ears. I was ‘underwhelmed’ by the noise cancellation UNTIL I got the correct fit w/largest silicone tips. Then with the correct fit; the world just vanished when I turned on noise cancelling. I’m able to listen to music at 50% volume instead of the 80%+ w/AirPods (originals).  The sound is improved in bass end & overall balance & staging are exceptional. The seamless pairing & operation with my iPhone X & Apple Watch make for a perfect integrated system.\", \"Bought this to use while working out. The silicon tip doesn't really wanna stay in my ears. When I'm running on the treadmill, I would have to shove it back in every time it comes out, roughly every 3-4 minutes. I had to buy one of those 3rd party foam tip to fix that issue. Also, when it's not in my ear properly, I can hear some weird clicking sound. Mostly from the right side. I don't know if that's something that needs to be fixed or not. But certainly not ideal. Pros 1. Exceptional sound quality 2. Easy to use with iphone 3. Amazing noise cancellation Cons 1. Won't stay in the ear while working out 2. Horrible build quality for the price\", 'For refurbed, second-life AirPods Pro... I’m pretty impressed! I’ve experienced better noise cancelling in other headphones/IEMs, but I actually bought these to use transparency mode while at work and its really great! It’s nice to be able to listen to (my own) music and be aware of your surroundings and people trying to get your attention. Sounds quality is pretty solid. The lows “hit” sub 50hz which is nice for a pair of Bluetooth ear buds. Some PAs have trouble reproducing some of the lows these do. Mids are clean and highs are crisp but not harsh. Haven’t messed with the positional audio yet, but I will update this review when I do. Side note: these are like new. There’s nothing from what I can tell, aside from some very minor pocket scuffing and the lack of Apple plastic wrap to show that these had been used prior to me receiving them. Solid purchase. Thank you!', 'I’m not a audiophile, not by a long shot but these little guys have such an impressive sound quality and noise cancelation that just leave me in awe! I bought these mainly because my first gen AirPods started to fail on me, (and also because they were $50 off but that’s between you and me) but boy am I glad they did these are awesome when I mow my lawn I hardly hear my mower and I can assure you it’s loud! But if you need to be able to hear noise transparency is just what you need, on the lower volume settings it’s like you don’t have anything in and the music is just like background elevator music. Quite frankly it’s what you expect when the product bares a Apple logo, all I’m saying is that you really get what you pay for when you’re buying these. I added a side by side of my first gen AirPods with the AirPods Pro.', 'Everything I own is Apple, so when these came out I had to have them! The fast switching between, let’s say MacBook Pro and an iPhone is really very nice, but if you throw in an iPad, the earbuds get confused. So I guess limit the switching to just 2 products. The sound quality is better when the Noise Cancellation is on. They aren’t particularly loud, and if you manually play with EQ settings on your phone or MacBook, it seems to degrade the sound and distort the bass. Battery life is ok, but could be better, I get about 3.5 hours of life. The Case is nice and I can usually charge the AirPod Pro’s twice to three times before it needs a charge too. Flipping the lid up on the case projects a window to pop up on your iPhone or iPad that shows each individual pods battery percentage as well as the cases battery percentage. The price is on par with some heavy hitters like Bose and Beats, but the sound quality is not.', \"I upgraded from a pair of standard AirPods v2.  What I enjoyed about the AirPods was how easily they paired to my iOS devices and how light they were in the ear. What annoyed me most about them however was the fit.  They constantly fell out of my ear and forced me to get a set of ear hooks.  That solved my fit issues and created a better in-ear seal, but it required me to have to take the hooks off in order the store them in the case. At the $199 promotional price, the AirPods Pro is worth the purchase for Apple user considering the standard AirPods.  The fit is OUTSTANDING!  As soon as I pulled them out of the case and put them in, they fit perfectly in my ear with the standard (M) tips.  I can shake my head and they do not give me any feeling of falling out. For $199, you'll get better sound, improved design, superior (semi-custom) fit, ANC, great controls, spatial sound, wireless charging case over the standard AirPods.\", \"The sound quality and technical ability of these pods when paired with Apple devices are outstanding. The fit is what killed this purchase for me. The pods will not stay in my ears. I've tried all three sizes of the silicone attachments that come with them and none of them is a good fit. The pods are constantly falling out. I'm afraid to use them for fear of them falling out and getting lost or damaged. I've even tried purchasing accessories to improve the fit but nothing seems to work. Sadly for most activities, I have to revert back to using my apple earbuds with the wire. I should have returned them when I had the opportunity but the sound quality and tech abilities were so pleasing that I was determined to find a solution. Unfortunately to date nothing has been found and they sit unused because it's too frustrating to contsantly readjust and touch them to keep them in place\", \"I received these as a gift for Christmas. I wanted the pro because of the noise cancellation. I received them and immediately set them up on my iPhone 11. I used them for a phone call that took about an hour and removed them afterwards. Here are my thoughts -- Sound Quality -- overall the sound quality was good but did notice a bit of echo. I didn't look into this very much but might have been due to the room I was in. I felt the sound quality was good and I am sure if I tinkered with the sound it would have been better. Comfort -- this was the deal breaker for me. The AirPods Pro come with three tips (small, medium and large). I tried all three for extended periods of time and they all caused my ears to hurt afterwards. Previously, I used the wired earbuds that come with the iPhone and have used them for extended periods of time and never had issues. Ultimately, this caused me to return these back to Amazon. Everyones comfort will be different so I would still encourage others to try them. Be aware that you may find the original AirPods (non Pro) to be more comfortable than the Pro version because of the silicone for noise cancellation. Personally, I found a cheaper set ($40) bluetooth headphones found on Amazon to be much more comfortable and be comparable in quality. I was also disappointed that Apple didn't even include a wall charger for these at $249.\", \"love the noise canceling. These don't stay in my ear. My husband has a set of regular air pods and i can run with them with no fear of them falling out. These are different and I don't love the fit compared to the regular AirPods. I also can NOT control the volume on my Garmin music 254 that i just purchased. The AirPods are perfect, but the AirPods Pro volume is SO loud and can't run with them. sad because i don't run with my phone and just use my watch. The noise canceling is awesome. I sew with them and use my very loud serger as well. So mixed feelings. I feel like i need a pair of both. regular for fit in ears, and volume when running (non apple watch device), and the noise canceling when sewing and using toy phone for pods or music. :(\", 'If you’re and Apple fanatic then you probably will love everything about these. They are great earbuds and you get some solid sound quality out of them. They aren’t the loudest buds I’ve tried, but the noise cancellation helps. Transparency mode is cool and allows for you to hear, but if you’re listening to music loud, it really would do much to help. The best feature though is being able to hear your messages if you get a text. So when you’re out on a run, you don’t have to bother to pulling out your phone or looking to your watch and then respond by voice. Still no volume adjusters on the side and the squeeze to play/pause and skip can be cumbersome when biking or running. Overall great quality, but still will fall out of your ear and can be a little fumbly at times to use. I think beats have better sound.', 'My 2-star review is not with the air pods or Apple at all. The air pods are stellar. My poor review is for the sellers of this product who have it advertised as “new” and never used. When I opened the box the first thing I noticed was that there were only 2 sets of ear cushions when Apple clearly states that they come with 3 different sized (S, M, L). The missing set I could overlook & not make a big deal of. But the real kicker & hard core evidence that the “new” airpod pros that I had purchased were previously owned by another Apple customer was this ….. when I first connected them to my iPhone they came up as “Angie’s Air Pod Pros!” My name couldn’t be further from Angie. I’m not sure who Angie is, but if I had to render a guess I’m going to bet that the missing ear cushion set is somewhere in one of Angie’s junk drawers in her kitchen. I tried to contact the seller with no response back. Like I said, the air pod pros are great, but I would like to exchange them for the “new” set that I paid for originally. Maybe Angie wants her air pods back?', 'Highly recommend you look into the mic problems with the AirPods Pro. The mic picks up every single tiny sound around you and amplifies it many times. The result is that if you are unzipping your backpack while talking to someone with the AirPods, it will sound like you are running a chainsaw to the person on the other end. If you are typing on your computer at work, it will sound like you are pounding a hammer in the ear of the person you are talking to. If you only want to listen to music, these are great. They are TERRIBLE for talking to other people unless you are completely still. This is a known and documented issue, which you can read endless comments about on the Apple support site. Shame on Apple for not solving this known problem.', 'Several co-workers invested in these and raved about them.  I\\'m cheap...I\\'ve been through many inexpensive wireless earbuds trying to find the \"good enough\" solution.  I finally relented and bought these when Amazon reduced their price by $15.  They are all that.  I fly weekly and these things block out ambient plane noise better than my over the ear ANC headphones. They exceeded all expectations in that department.  I\\'m still struggling with the ear tips and which is more comfortable (medium or large)...I do have some ear \"fatigue\" (not enough to be considered pain - discomfort more like it) after wearing them for more than two hours.  But the sound is great and ANC is spectacular.  I have run with them and will admit, I was constantly worried about them coming out though they never did actually slip or move...could be psychological (\"just my luck...go over a storm drain and they fall out\").  However, from experience with silicon ear pieces, I will most likely NOT wear them in the heat to exercise as the silicon tips tend to trap moisture in the ear which is uncomfortable.  However, for my constant flying, the ANC and portability of them alone is worth the price.', \"As is typical for Apple, the overall design is very good. However this product does have its flaws. First it does not always connect on the first couple of attempts. Next, when riding a bike or running (with only one in the right ear) the volume increased to max without any input from me. I tried a few different pockets and positions of the phone as I thought it might be rubbing. Anyhow, after several tries over several days and long sessions with Apple it still fails. I gave up and decided to return them to Amazon. Lo and behold- I was 5 days beyond Amazon's return date, so no return was possible. Long story short, Apple is sending a replacement pair. If they don't work I will bite the bullet, throw them out and buy the Sony.  Bye, Bye $250 bucks.\", 'I am quite surprised I would be providing such a negative review for an Apple product. I purchased these back in March last year. Love them for the convenience and use them regularly for my daily runs to listen to podcasts and music. However, I have had several issues and replacements in the last 9 months that I could only give it two stars. The first issue happened in Sept 2020, where one of the airpods stopped connecting to my iPhone. After calling product support and they tried troubleshooting the issue, they suggested that I receive a replacement airpod and so I did. Yet again, in Dec, the left airpod stopped working. And yet again I had to go through the same grind of getting a replacement and returning my current one (the Fedex that accepts battery included products is 20 miles away from home - so, it was hugely inconvenient for me). It is January 23rd 2021 when I am writing this review and for the third time, the left airpod stopped working again. In each of these instances, what I have observed is that I need to push the airpod in a specific way into the wireless charger and it manages to start charging. However, I need to keep the wireless charger in a specific position (such as vertical) for the airpod to charge inside it. For a $250 Apple product, I would expect it to be hassle free, but honestly, I have had to spend hours and hours trying to troubleshoot issues. The other challenge is that, given there are no visual indicators on the airpods, it is very hard to tell which airpod has run out of battery or had other issues - so, it is practically impossible even for Apple support to debug problems when they occur. I am quite surprised how I could have been unlucky three times in a row, but I am receiving yet another replacement and hoping that this ends all my miseries. That said, my limited warranty is close to ending - so, this is perhaps my last opportunity to receive a replacement without incurring a charge. Come on Apple, you can do better!', 'Are these refurbished or what? Absolute joke. Bought these to replace my old ones I didn’t notice the cat knocked into the clothes hamper and , yeah. Out of the box the battery doesn’t last anywhere near what my old set did. In fact, I charged these to 100% on Thursday, went to use them for the first time since charging on Sunday and and both pods and the case were at 0% and unusable. Can’t get anymore than a day or two out of each charge when my old set only needed charging once per week.', 'Regardless that they come with different sized rubber pieces these just don’t fit securely in my ears; they keep falling out or loosening to the point that the sound is impacted. I would never do any activities while using them or I would surely lose one! They’re really awkward to figure out which way to put them in your ear (and to figure out which one goes in which ear. It’s difficult to get them out of the case because there isn’t much to grab onto. The sound is okay and they connect great with my apple products. Connecting to the TV can be tricky but that may also have something to do with the TV itself (not sure). You do have to turn off all other blue tooth devices nearby. I’m gonna go ahead and call these an Apple failure; I really expected perfect everything because of the brand and price 😞  They need to be redesigned!! I really wish I had not made this purchase.', 'Before these came out, I ordered the 2nd gen AirPods to try them out. I find the regular Apple EarPods to be incredibly uncomfortable and was unfortunately not surprised when the AirPods were also uncomfortable. I returned them after wearing them for less than an hour. Then...Apple made my wireless headphone dreams come true! I held out for awhile on these due to the price. But with a return of a Christmas gift for a gift card, my out of pocket cost was much more reasonable. I’ve only had these for about 24 hours but I am loving them so far. The small adapters fit well in my ear, though sometimes the right one randomly starts to migrate, which may be related to my Travis piercing in that ear. I bought these more for work and travel and not really for exercise, so I haven’t tried them yet working out. The noise cancellation and transparency options seem to work really well and I also like that you can do a fit test. I’ve had no issues with connectivity so far. I did buy a silicone case with a carabiner to protect them and help prevent me from losing them. The case is sturdy and the AirPods seem secure inside. I like the squeeze controls much better than the tapping on the 2nd gen AirPods I tried before. I never seemed to be able to tap in the right spot and the squeeze with the audible click as feedback is so much easier! I still think they look a bit ridiculous in the ear, but I think all true wireless buds do, so it’s not a big issue for me. I have made one call and had no issues with the person on the other end hearing me. Definitely recommend, especially if you find other Apple EarPods/AirPods uncomfortable.', \"I have the wired Airpods (3.5mm plug & Lightning plug) and wireless Airpods (Gen 1) and have been pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and ear fit in all of these. When the Airpod Pros were released, I was very interested in the Noise Cancellation capability of an in-ear headphone. I waited to hear what others experience was with them, which all seemed to be positive in general. So, I am expecting, at minimum, the same sound quality maybe better, solid ear-fit with the silicone tips added, NC and Spatial Audio.  I have never been impressed with SA and have been exposed to it for several years with other devices (extensively with the Playstation Headsets) and unless the audio from a video game, movie or music has a SA specific Audio track (like being able to switch from the 2-Channel stereo audio track to an Audio track recorded specifically for Audio 5.1, 5.2, 7.1 or 7.2), the audio artificially fills in to give the perception of an open space and you are submersed in sound, but it the existing audio spreadout. I also don't understand the head-tracking feature, again this feels gimicky. If you have this on and turn your head to the right, all the audio then mostly plays through the left Airpod. Why would you want or need that. They are trying to imitate surround sound or 5.1 Audio. I have had a 5.1 & 7.1 Audio setup via my AV reciever. I want to experience the Audio the way the music, sound effects, dialog is intended to be heard. When they edit Movies, Video Games, etc. and they offer Stereo or 5.1 Surround Sound, those are all SEPERATE Audio Tracks specifically editted to play through specific audio channels to more fully immerse you into the Movie or Game. If the scene is an intense and quiet, they may have a sound play behind you and to the right. You do not get the same experience with fake Spatial Audio. True Surround Sound is a much different experience than fake. But I am a purist when it comes to Audio and Video. If the director goes to the time and effort to have every Audio Track designed for Stereo or surround, I want to hear it the way he intended for you to experience it. I know that Apple Music is recording music with Spatial Audio in mind, but the tracks that I listened to sounded better in true stereo. I have had these for several months and have tried all the different size ear tips to prevent them from falling out of my ear, with no success. And I was just doing things around my house, not running, jogging, working out. I had once instance where I had walked into the bathroom to get clean linens and just from my body motion the left Airpods fell out of my ear and into the toilet, luckily the water was clean but that is little consolation when your $200+ Airpod is submerged in water. For me, the NC was the only impressively successful implementation. Even listening to them without the new features, I have never been able to get the same Bass, Mid and Treble sound. I went back to using my First Gen Airpods and the quality of sound was so much better than the Pros. This was a miserable attempt to add new features, just to add new features and fail hard. I have a friend that just purchased the Airpods 3rd Gen, he had the Pros as well, and said they were so much better sounding than the Pros. So do I spend ANOTHER $200 to get the quality I should have had with the Pros? I may just go back to using the wired lightning headset. All 3 versions of the Airpods (2 wired, 1 wireless) all have the same quality. Apple leaves me cold and taken advantage of, and I'm sure they could careless about my opinions, but having listened to movies and music for the past 50+ years, I know cheap when I hear it.\", 'The first piece of technology that has impressed my in a long time. I can barely turn my head without traditional air buds falling out. I’ve comfortably multiple 5-8 mile runs with these without needing to readjust and without any noticeable bumping / strange noises. • comfortable for hours at a time • stay in while running • Transparency mode is fantastic for roadside running. • I can hear well enough on my bike over wind noise with noise cancellation on (not recommended). •  Siri can hear me and change tracks, adjust volum, activate noise cancellation etc without needing to shout. • if not wearing all day continuously, the case provides enough juice to get most people through the day. • switches well between my windows laptop and iPhone 11. Only two opportunities: • wouldn’t recommend wearing on bike at high speeds. Was nervous they’d fall out going 28 in my e-bike. No problem riding my mountain bike on easy trails though. • I wish I could adjust volume and change tracks on the headphones without using Siri as I don’t always want to talk or fumble for my phone.', \"Edit: After trying out other equivalent options with the same specs in this category (in-ear headphones, wireless with ANC), I decided to give these another shot and to my surprise they were actually really good. I don't know what I was smoking when I wrote everything below this edit, or maybe I got a bad pair, but these sound significantly clearer and better than my 1st gen airpods, the bass is just as present if not clearer and more deliberate.  The ANC on these are amazing and I think anyone considering purchasing these just for the improved sound quality wouldn't be wasting money, but will also be pleasantly surprised by how useful and effective the ANC is. I think for most people these are as best as headphones can get, and anyone looking for better sound quality after getting these should only do so if they listen to music that can actually benefit from those higher end, audiophile headphones (classical, jazz, etc) I bought these hoping to hear a significant upgrade between my 1st gen airpods, this is my experience with them. Sound: They sound pretty similar to regular AirPods. After extensive testing between the two, I couldn’t find a difference *except in bass* where ironically the regular AirPods had much better bass that shakes your ear while the pros are a light thud. As a bass head, immediately not a fan. Design: These use silicon ear tips instead of the classic airpods design and that’s another reason I decided to return them. After a while they gave me a sharp pain in my right ear which the old ones never did. Noise-Cancelling: This is easily the best feature about the AirPods. The implementation of ANC is probably the best of any in ear in the market, however i don’t think considering the aforementioned trade offs that it’s worth it for me personally. To sum it up if you already have airpods only get these if you want the noise cancellation and don’t mind in ear silicon tips. If you’re expecting even better sound quality, don’t bother.\", 'This headphones are probably the best sounding (overall sound) wireless in-ear headphones I\\'ve ever heard. The sound is crisp with great highs, mids, and yes, even lows. I\\'ve always been a BEATS fan for the heavier base, but this sound is better overall. I\\'m extremely impress with the ACN (Active Noise Cancellation). It works incredibly well, and the transparency mode is fantastic when you still want to be able to hear what\\'s going on around you. With all that said, I do think there are a few cons. Not deal breakers, but areas that I think could make this device perfect: 1. Biggest complaint, there is no power adapter with the charging cable, and the charging cable is USB-C. Meaning you cannot plug the charging cable into the same plugin blocks you have for all your other USB charging devices. Yes, you can use any lightning cable to charge the case, but why include the new charging cable without a plugin adapter? 2. I do miss volume controls on the ear buds. You can pause, forward, go back, change ACN, and activate Siri with squeezing the earbuds, but you can\\'t change the volume unless you physically do it on your connected phone, or you tell Siri to increase the volume. 3. You can reassign the squeeze on each ear bud for ACN or Siri, but the ACN setting must be the same on both. So for example you can\\'t have the left turn on ACN or Transparency, and the left simply turn it off. They must both be the same. Or you can set one side to activate Siri instead of simply saying \"Hey Siri.\" 4. The charging case as a light on it, green for fully charged, orange for depleted. But there\\'s no indicator on the case it self for how charged it is. You can view the percentage on your phone, but I wish there were 4 or 5 small indicator lights on the case to tell you how charged it is, 25%, 50%, 75% etc. Similar to how the laptops have the battery indicator lights on the side. 5. Memory Foam tips would be incredible. Don\\'t get me wrong, the silicone tips are fine, and the fit is great (I use the large), but coming from BEATS, Shure, and Bose in the past, I know how good the foam tips work for fit, and passive noise cancellation. Providing foam tips would me a great product even better! (DO NOT BUY any 3rd party foam tips, these tips are a property connection that is unique. I\\'m not familiar with any 3rd party brands that will fit perfectly at this point.) All that said - These are fantastic and I am very happy with my purchase. There\\'s just a few things they could do to make these great headphones even better.', \"I bought these on a whim on Prime day. I didn't think I needed them and didn't mind the wire. I learned very quickly that I love them and I the wire was a pain. The best features are the sound quality, comfort and ease of use. I love the charging system and amazed at how many uses I get before I have to charge the charging case. The slight downside is that the noise cancelling is only okay compared with my over the ear full size headphones. That aside I still love them.\", 'These are a good value (when I purchased them, they were $197 on Amazon). I had an issue with another pair that developed a scratchy noise in one earbud, which is likely a known issue with Apple, which Apple repaired after the warranty was up, which was great. I later decided to upgrade to the Bose noise-canceling earbuds which have superior noise cancelation but they were so complicated to use and the Bluetooth pairing was wonky (I didn\\'t want to spend my life talking to customer service reps just to get them to work properly) so returned those and went back to these, which are just so easy to use. The only thing that was better was the noise canceling, which I would say is \"fair\" but for ease-of-use, smaller size, and good customer service, these earbuds are my choice.', 'My very picky older son got a pair of these the other night and LOVES THEM.  He is overly picky about “stuff”. Willing to pay for the best as long as it really is.  He brought them back the other night and we all tried them, damn if he is not right.  The noise canceling was amazing, brought tears to my wife’s eyes when she tried them, my jaw dropped when it was my time (good thing no flys this time of year). They are worth every penny.  My wife loves them so much that I think we are sending back my regular pair that I got the other night for another pair of these (that will go to her, I’ll take them hand-me downs (her current pair) from her). TWO THUMBS WAY WAY WAY UP!!!', 'I am surprised I am writing this. I had given up on Apple innovating and creating a NEW great product  years ago*( the watch is a bomb if you ask me) .Example,  I still use an Iphone, a 5 year old well maintained 5SE, (I hate their models of the last 5 years, they are hugggge). Anyway, I use ear buds daily at work, 5-6 hours a day, every day.  I have at least 8 pair, 5-6 wired 4-5 non wired and spent some serious money on a few, my best wired pair  are a high end set of Shures, my wireless,  Bose, Jaybirds, Jabra etc.  I am always and have been looking for that sweet spot; great sound, they actually stay in your ears , seamless phone inter-activity , noise cancelling . I listen to a wide range of music; ambient, rock, classical etc…  The first model airpods were crud, they didn’t stay in your ears, the sound was just ok to good etc. I had borrowed a pair for a week, that was my take. I borrowed a pair of the new airpod pros, and, its like going from a roman candle to a moonshot from the original model to this second generation. The Pros sound better than my jabras, jaybirds by a mile , do they sound like my wired Shures? No, of course not. But they are darn good. The case is well made and charges your pods very quickly. The pods have excellent phone interaction , best I have ever  used. The noise cancellation (and fit kit)  is a huge Wow,  imho the original Airpod model had zero noise can cancellation. I gotta say they shocked me, the pros are a very very good set of earbuds.', 'I’ve had my airpods for a little less than a year. Everything was going great until a couple of months ago. The transparency mode sounds staticky and isn’t as clear as it used to be. The noise cancellation isn’t as good as it used to be either. I’ve done multiple deep cleaning sessions with them, they’ve helped in little amounts but not enough to be where they used to be. Also, siri cannot understand a word I say when I have them in. If I were to say “Hey Siri, play Telescope by Cavetown on Spotify”, she would read back “Calling Josepha Sánchez mobile”. Like what?? Siri works fine normally on my phone, but the second I put my airpods she goes haywire. This could be completely my fault, dropping them, not changing enough settings, etc. On top of all of this, one of my dogs recently got a hold of one of the ear buds and it now has bite marks 😑. It surprisingly hasn’t seemed to effect or worsen what’s already been happening. Regardless, I plan on contacting support to try and troubleshoot anything that might be causing an issue through settings. Do with this what you wish.', 'I’m a life long Apple fan.. These are great, but not perfect.. They do sound great, have great noise cancellation & amazing hear through BUT the battery is NOT great, yes you can drop them in the case & charge them up but the battery life while using the features & listening to music or taking calls drops pretty quick. AND the fit, I had to order two different sets of aftermarket ear tips from two different manufacturers to finally get a set that kept the AirPod pros from falling out of my ears. Overall I really really like them and kept them, I can deal with the battery life, I guess I was expecting better from Apple BUT if I didn’t find a good set of aftermarket ear tips that kept them in my ears, I probably would of had to return them. Overall after getting over a few short comings I’m happy with them!', \"I don't understand how these earbuds work for most people, be warned that for some (like me) they simply will not stay in your ear, providing a very frustrating experience. Even when I was holding them in the sound quality was good but not great. Had to return.\", \"Die hard Apple fan here. I love the ecosystem so have all Apple products. They just fail at their earbud design for many of us. The lucky ones have the types of ears that these buds will sit in snugly. For some of us, we need to plug in the bud down the ear canal so they stay. That's where these fail for me. I can only push so far before the big round part hits my ear and goes in no more. So, like pants that slowly fall throughout the hour, these buds slowly come loose. I have to keep jamming them back in. While I was washing my car they fell twice. The second time they rolled under the car and I had to lay on the wet dirty driveway to get under the car only to find a scrape on the bud from falling. I can think of better ways to spend $200. In fact, my $10 Panasonic earbuds fit much better and sound great. Of course they're not wireless and have no functions, but it makes you wonder why you might spend $200 for problems. Apple is creating awesome earbuds for some and alienating the rest of us.\", 'Very pleased with the sound quality and noise cancellation. They look nice and I like the charging case as well. However, I think it’s worth also looking at other brands for these reasons: 1) While this doesn’t seem to be an issue for most people, they CONSTANTLY fell out of my ears until I bought third party replacement pieces. It was embarrassing on video calls and a huge pain to have to keep hunting around on the floor for the piece that fell out. If I hadn’t found the third party foam replacement pieces I would have returned the AirPods for sure. 2) They really hurt my ears, no matter which size I tried. The third party foam pieces fixed this though. 3) Somehow they lose charge even when they’re off. Mine were almost fully charged when I left them sitting on a table overnight (not in their case). I figured they wouldn’t lose much if any charge since they were literally turned off. However, when I put them in for a video call in the morning they died almost immediately. Now I know to always put them in their case, so this isn’t a huge deal, but just weird.', \"This product's battery life is extremely low.  One of the pods turns off after only about 2 hours, and the other one not too long after.  I always have them fully charged.  I wouldn't buy this product again. UPDATE:  I continue to have major battery life problems.  Today, they lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes before the left one stopped working.  It was a zero percent while the high was still at 7l percent.  Put in charging case, it said it would take 12 hours to fully charge.  Called apple, and they walked me through a reset — but the same problem persists.  While sound quality is good, the battery life is terrible.  I am going back to my headphones which last about 6 days on a charge.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.\", 'I’ve had a few head phones in my day, but these AirPod pros are pretty darn good. Sound wise, they are comparable to the Jabra 65t’s I’ve had, but with smoother transition from Apple device to Apple device. That Apple “switchablity” is why I went with these over the new and improved Jabra 75t model. These AirPod pros are a little awkward taking out and putting back in the case, but I was just used to the smoothness of the original AirPods in that regard. (It’s possible I’m just not coordinated - I still fumble with my Powerbeat pro case a few months in with them as well). I DO think the magnetic closure of the AirPod pro case will make it the most secure out of all the wireless buds I’ve owned. If dropped, the Powerbeat pros as well as the Jabras pop right out and I actually lost a jabra down a vent. And I recall the original AirPods doing that at least twice. The AirPods pro active noise cancelling seems fine, not sure if it’s THAT much better than the 65t’s passive (or physically obstructive) noise cancelling. The AirPod pros are light and comfortable, even in a bed (Something that my Jabra or Powerbeat pros could never do) and I can easily forget they are in my ears. So far, so good.', 'Would highly recommend. However, for some reason, airpods just don’t fit well in my ears and continually fall out. Even with the various size foam that come with the pro. However, I have the Samsung galaxy buds which fit great but then bother my ears after a while. I can keep the pros in comfortably all day and not even know they are there  (if they would stay) lol. Sound quality is great and perfect for chatting on calls. There was too much background noise with the galaxy buds - people would complain about the loud noises when I’m getting things done while talking. With the Pros, there has not been one complaint which is main reason for my purchase. So far, I’m having problem with these AirPods and my Lenovo laptop for conference calls. There’s too much interference but not sure if that’s all other devices in area - especially Alexa.  Overall, I’m happy with my purchase and would highly recommend these.', 'I will admit that I do not have a ton of experience with true wireless earbuds. I’ve used Galaxy buds, GB live, Anker soundcore liberty pro and liberty pro 2. With iPhone however, the AirPods Pro are probably the best sounding, fully functional earbuds you will find that work great with the phone. I know there are other earbuds on the market that have better sound quality and that’s why I scored these a 4 on sound. Sound is good though. They are super comfy too! Noise canceling works great. Also, Apples spacial audio is pretty cool. Netflix has the feature now and I was really amazed by it. Just for the record, I’m not an Apple fanboy. I like Samsung also. I just happen to have an iPhone for the time being. 😉', 'I was skeptic because I have the first AirPods and thought those would be great. Bought these for my husband as a gift and low key for myself and I Connor believe how awesome they are. The technology that they made for the noise cancellation is amazing and true. You can barely hear your surroundings when you have it on and the music quality and base is beyond this world. Side note: if you don’t have an Apple phone you won’t get the full experience. I have an apple and my husband has an android and the sound on the apple is wayyyyy better. I tried to unlock his sound setting so it would be more amplified. It helped a little bit not worth the money if you don’t have an Apple. Word to the wise!', 'I was immediately disappointed with both the poor sound quality & very poor excuse for noise cancellation. I even tried downloading an after market EQ app to see if they could improve on the cheap, thin sounding Air Pods, but with no luck. After watching some video tutorials and going through my music library trying desperately to find something, anything that sounded even decent, well., total failure. I started the exchange for the Bose ear pods. Those have superior customer reviews but are about $90.00 more. I don’t mind paying for excellent sound, these Air Pods are among the worst sounding in ear buds that I’ve ever tried.', 'I like them when they work;  the problem is if you happen to get a “lemon” pair and have to send to AppleCare, they send you a refurbished pair which also doesn’t last.  I have never used my AirPod Pros outside my home yet I’ve had to return them 3 times in 9 months.  The problem has always been with the left AirPod — starts humming then stops working altogether.  And once get a refurbished pair, the cycle never ends — I haven’t had a set last more than 3 months.  Maybe the 4th time is the “charm”.', 'Have spent literally HUNDREDS of dollars to find an earbud that will cancel out my noise for the person on the other end and noise that I hear around me while providing premium sound while listening to music and actually stays in your ear and feel comfortable Well This is IT!  No wonder that it has a whopping 4.8 stars with over 200,000 ratings Globally! If you’re looking for the PERFECT ear Bud that checks the box on ALL needs (phone conversation quality, music quality, battery life, comfort, ease of use and pairing, small and compact case that fits in palm of hand and in pocket, holds in ear without falling out), this ear Bud is the one for YOU!', \"Overall I like the airpod pros. They fit great and do not come loose, even while doing sit ups. They are pretty comfortable but I have a little discomfort after longer periods of usage. Sound is great for an earbud.  I give them 4 stars due to a few drawbacks.  The transparency mode is great for running or riding a bike so you can be aware of your surroundings. But, they pick up a ton of wind noise.  Even walking at a brisk pace seems to get some wind noise. The other issue I have had is they seem to cut in and out while connected to my S4 apple watch. They don't do it constantly, but it does happen once, every time I go to the gym.  And once they start cutting out, they keep doing it until I turn Bluetooth off and back on again.  They seem to play perfect from my phone and I can stay connected even with my phone on the other side of our office building... so the problem seems particular to the apple watch at the gym.  The problem is that was the main reason I bought them.  If the issue continues I'll be sending them back. At $230 they should maintain a connection to the watch that is no more than two feet away on my wrist, especially with other apple tech.\", 'I got these as a replacement for a traditional USB over-the-ears headset/microphone combination for work meetings, as well as a high fidelity source for listening to music on my iPhone. After trying them for about two weeks, I was not satisfied with how they worked, so I returned them. First, let me say that the music sounded great through them, but the deal breaker was that they never fit right.  I tried all three size adapters provided, and they were either so tight that they put uncomfortable physical pressure on my ear canal, or they were too loose and wouldn’t stay in.  Perhaps a flexible material versus a rigid core would work better. In terms of conferencing, I used them with my MacBook Pro, and surprisingly they sounded tinny (to be fair, that could have been the person speaking, but in fact the speaker was using the identical ear buds with the same built-in mike).  Also, when I spoke, it reverberated in my skull as if my fingers were in my ears, which is an unlistenable sound.  Again this may have been at least partially due to the fit being too tight. In summary, Apple has obviously put a lot of research into developing a technically advanced product, but I feel they could have done more to consider the human factors.', \"I have weird ears, they repel anything I stick in them; just falls right out.  I was hesitant to order them, due to price and whether they would work for me and ears.  First try, didn't really understand how to use them and was tempted to return. I asked my 17 yr old for help, he has the regular not the pro, we discovered they are different so after watching YouTube videos on tips and tricks, these things are amazing. With the touch of a button you can turn the noise cancelling on and off, pause, skip or go back on songs (works great with Amazon music) and works well with my iPhone, iPad and MacBook, no need for me to switch it seems to know which one I am using.  Due to working from home (COVID) and my 2 kids being at home, these have been a real game changer for zoom meetings and even FaceTime.  I love the wireless charging option and how you can see the battery life of both air pods and the case. I highly recommend these for anyone who likes to work in the quiet but may need to hear what's going on around them.\", 'A colleague and I have these cheapy Bluetooth earbuds that have worked well, but I figured it was time to upgrade. Bought into the hype and decided to buy a better audio experience for the endless video and conference calls.  AirPOd Pros, here we go. They arrived and were easy to set-up.  Sounds quality was really good (not amazing, but a decent step up from my old ones).  They stayed in my ears and I could move around freely.  The noise cancellation was decent - though not as much as I hoped.  Overall it was success and I thought they were well worth the price, until.... I tried to connect to my Mac and things fell apart.  They only connect to one device at a time.  My old headphones connect with multiple devices to make it easy to transfer between video and phone.  Whatever is putting out sound is picked up.  No buttons, no hassles, just really easy.  The AirPods required me to connect individually to each device.  And then my mac started randomly dropping and being unable to connect.  I couldn\\'t use it for a video call and had to go back to my old headset. I also noticed the buttons didn\\'t work when connected to my computer.  Oh, I could set up the functions for each ear and press the \"button\" once, but then they would stop working.  I\\'d have to pull them out of my ears and try to reconnect the computer.  Then they stopped working with my phone.  Battery level was fine, but useless.  Finally the computer stopped connecting at all.  I knew something wasn\\'t right, time to suck up my pride and phone for help. 4 calls to Apple support were all useless, their lines were just saying call back some other time.  Fine, they were busy.  But so am I. It was easier to go back and use my old headset - which is what I had to do all day. I get the hype. I usually love Apple products.  But I love Apple products because they usually work.  These were a failure.  Returned.', \"My product is brand new, genuine product. I was a bit apprehensive after reading some reviews about some people not getting the actual product but I received mine in brand new condition. I also checked the serial number on Apple.com and it's legit. The sound quality is very good, clarity is amazing as I can hear sounds clearer than with my Powerbeats. They fit in my ears with the medium earpiece. The only thing I wish it had was volume control, but I'm sure Apple will do that later this year with a new set as per the usual. Battery life could be better but i still get about 3-4 hours on one charge. I also definitely recommend getting a case for them to make traveling with them more convenient and protection.\", 'Love my new EarPod Pro’s..! Got them on sale. They sound  great, fit comfortably & so far the battery life is long too. My favorite thing about them is that I can sleep with them in my ears. They’re comfortable enough to lay on & they don’t cause any ear pain & I’m a side sleeper insomniac!.!. I’ve got them adjusted just right for my ears. They come with different size rubber things for different ear hole sizes. The only thing I can’t figure out is how to change options for each earpod. For example, I’d like to be able to press play, ffwd & next song. I can do all but Ffwd to the next song. I’d also like to be able to answer the phone with the EarPods when my phone is in the other room. I’ve only had them a couple days. I’d like to choose which EarPod controls which function. It’s a learning experience & so far so good. I’ll figure it out. Love ❤️ them!!!', \"These are great.  The noise cancellation is actually a bit creepy with how completely total the noise cancellation is.  The sound is great for music and podcasts.  The mic is great for phone calls.  I have accidentally hung up on people by touching the buds - still learning.  I have not figured out how to adjust the volume from the buds.  Also I have experienced the buds falling out when I bend over (think yoga and pulling stuff from the oven...THAT was a near disaster).  Even after making sure I had the right size bud covers this has happened.  Otherwise they are very comfortable.  Great 'how to' videos online to get the most from the buds.  I love that the case is charger it self.  I like I can find them if I put them in a place and forget.  Overall, I recommend these.\", 'I like the original but was curious to try these. I don’t really need the cancellatinuch but the transparent mode is what I wanted. I often use just one so I can hear other things with the original pods. Here you could use two and still hear your surroundings. Seems to work well though for podcasts I still like using one. Why did they go from a rap to squeeze for control? Makes little sense I liked tapping much better! And they should give us more options for control. Still no volume options? You only can set the long press to Siri or noise control. The short presses aren’t changeable. Why? Sound is very good! However Apple still offers no true equalizer for the entire phone. So you only can do that for apps with their own like Spotify. That’s a huge iOS flaw that they never seem to realize and it makes their headphone products less useful especially with these where tuning the bass is desired.', \"These headphones are absolutely awesome. The noise cancellation is amazing and the sound quality is very good. The battery life of the earbuds themselves could be better however the speed that they recharge in the charging case makes up for it. Being able to easily switch between devices with these headsets (when you have all Apple devices) is incredibly fast and it makes using regular bluetooth pairing extremely painful. I was also amazed with how well other people could hear me with almost no wind noise being picked up by the microphone even while biking at around 20 MPH. With all of this said, I ended up having to return these. Why? Because they were excruciatingly painful to wear in my left ear. I tried every size tip, I tried buying (overpriced) foam tips, and no matter what I did my left ear would hurt quite badly at the end of the day after wearing these headphones. If you can wear these headphones all day without pain then these are the best headphones you can get, unfortunately I can't so these aren't for me.\", 'I\\'m amazed at the sound -- particularly because my aging are not aging well.  Despite that, these sound exactly as I would want them to by default:  crisp across the board, crystal clear highs (where my own ears are starting to let me down), and comfortably powerful bass. Many new features made it into this version of the AirPods, one of the most important of which for me is the ability to easily remove and clean the ear tips periodically.  \"Find My\" works well, and as long as they\\'re not in the charging case (which is probably when the ability to find them is the most important), they ping loudly enough to be found. I never buy Apple\\'s first generation of anything, but their third generation nails it.', \"...you get what you pay for.  I'm not an audiophile or anything like that but I was surprised at how good these sounded when I first sampled some music.  Especially the base reproduction.  But maybe most buds that fit in this way are similar.  So, for the price, I feel a little less pain now. I was worried about having a defective pair since the buds themselves were only at 50% out of the box.  But after thinking about how the charging probably works I think I figured it out.  Sitting on the shelf, the buds will loose charge normally.  The case will not use all of its charge to KEEP them at 100%.  It probably shuts off after they first reach 100% and does not re-engage until the lid is opened/closed - which is what I did after opening the package.  Not long after that I pulled them out of the case and they were at 100% and the case had dropped a small percentage. Noise cancellation is fascinating.  Wish I had that when I worked in an office.\", 'The sound quality is great (when it\\'s great), but all that stuff about how the initializing and transfer is seamless and easy? That\\'s a total crock. Really really frustrating. Plus, I have had two pairs, and they both needed to be send back for repair. For this price, they should perform much much better. Remember when one of Apple\\'s slogans was \"It just works\"? I see why they abandoned that. These just don\\'t.', \"Reviews can be mixed about this thing. But I think that they were very well for what they are. Of course they are a bit pricey but I think you get good technology. I wouldn’t consider myself an audio file but music quality is outstanding. Noise cancellation words very well and can notice the difference. Very comfortable to wear for extended periods. Would be nice if they came in a different color like black but that’s never gonna happen. ** Update ** Since my original purchase, I've had to send at least one back twice because it started emitting static. The third time was an outright replacement of the entire unit at the Apple store a few months ago. I think the bugs aren't quite worked out yet. I think the right one is starting to go already. I took away one star.\", 'I uses to have first Air pods, but I got problem with it, it can’t stay with my ear, always fell off when I doing something. So i lose right one I don’t even know it.  But I am so happy I bought this AirPods pro,  it fit very perfectly and very comfortable. with the new transparency mode, it was a good experience.  After the regular AirPods , I bought a several earphones, it didn’t fit very well with my ear, sometimes it hurts and can’t hearing anything beside me.  The AirPods pro did all the things just right for me,  that is the best earphone I got.  Really recommended it , if anybody got the some problem just like me, just buy it ,it worth it.', 'Hey peasants, I couldn’t hear you over these air pods, just kidding, oh wait, no I’m not. I really can’t hear you, these are good. I get stares around, well, not the streets since I’m quarantined, but around the house I’m quite the celebrity, of course I live alone, but I I know Jeff Bezos is watching me through Alexa with either pity or envy, I wanted to ask but Alexa kept telling me there was no war in Ba Sing Se for some reason. Oh yeah and these go into your ears good too. Anyone know where the wires are though? I can’t find where to put this in my android Edit: I lost one in the couch, but that’s fine, only one of them ever worked when I put it in the charger anyway, seriously though the charger for one never even worked, wired ear buds are hard to go back to though so you’ve herded this sheep well, descendants of Steve Jobs.', 'Liked the compact case and wireless charging and the application on the iPhone to control the pods. Dislikes : 1. The design and the feel of pods is not worth $250 2. Though the package was unopened, the brand new case had scratches - see pictures marked 3. The left pod assembly closures edges are not perfectly aligned feels sharp at the edges  , this is not expected for such a costly product. The finish looks like a cheap way of inspected out of factory Disappointed with the deign and finish for $250', 'Like using high-end, over-the-ear headphones but without the bulk. The AirPod Pros have been compared to Bose 700s ($399). That\\'s s a nice compliment but misses the point. The AirPods cost less and are much better suited for travel or even wearing around the house. The \"transparency mode\" lets you enjoy your music and stay aware of your surroundings. It does much more than just deactivate the noise cancelling feature. I was able to \"demo\" a pair at the The Apple Store. Which was nice, because it might take a couple of try\\'s to get the best fit. They come with 3 different sizes of silicone gaskets to help maximize comfort and performance. After you get them situated, the AirPods will run a \"sound-check\" to confirm you have the best fit. More than anything, you\\'ll appreciate the sound quality. The high-tech stuff is icing on the cake. If you love music (and you get these) eventually you\\'ll listen to a great song that you\\'ve heard a hundred times... and realize that you\\'ve been missing certain instruments, notes or words. That\\'s when the AirPod Pros will go from feeling like a luxury item to a necessity. The Apple Store was out-of-stock, so I ordered them on Amazon.', \"I'm sure AirPods pros themselves are a quality product. However, it is impossible for me to write a positive review when my product did not work when it arrived. When I opened the case for the first time, the light turned white, which is the syncing mode. Instead of syncing to my phone, an error message popped up on my phone. I thought it wasn't a big deal, since I could press the button on the back until it turned back into syncing mode. That is when I noticed the blinking green light. It would not go into syncing mode no matter how long I held it. It would not even reset. I charged my AirPods to full battery to see if that helped, but it did not. This was delivered on a very cold day where I live, so I don't know if the cold damaged it during shipping, but things people say online makes me think that is unlikely. I was probably just sold a defective pair of individual AirPods with a working case.\", \"I have been on the fence with buying these because the original Apple earbuds didn't fit my ears.  I thought that with the Pros having the rubber tip, it would make a difference and I would finally be able to use Apple earbuds.  I was wrong.  They still didn't fit properly, even with switching the tip to the different sizes that were provided.  I ended up purchasing foam tips for them from Amazon, which has made all the difference and made them finally fit my ears. Besides the fit, I absolutely love these!  I love the sound, the noise cancellation (it even cancels out my children arguing with one another in background!), and how seamlessly it syncs with my iPhone (which is a given).  They are just perfect!  The battery life has been long, I haven't had them go dead on me yet, and I use them daily- most of the day.  I have been told that people I am having a phone call with can actually hear me better now than when I actually use my phone. Very best of all is that as a consequence for arguing I often put them on and sing at the top of my lungs (I can't hear myself, but my kids can.  They are preteens and I have been told I am completely cringy.  I wouldn't know- I can't hear myself through the excellent noise cancellation that the Airpods provide!!!  Add dancing and you'll have those pre-teen/teens really freaking out- they'll be running to their rooms and slamming the door in no time!  :)  These Airpods are a good time for everyone!\", \"I have all Apple devices but I was never able to use the regular Airpods because they just don't fit my ears and constantly fall out. Besides, it looks like you have a pair of Q-tips sticking out of your ears. Along came the Airpods Pro with the shorter sticks and, more importantly, earbuds that could fit in the ear canal for hopefully a tight fit. I really wanted to like these but there are some basic flaws I just couldn't overcome. First of all, the case and Airpods are made of a very sleek and SLIPPERY, plastic. I had to put a protective case over the charging case to keep from dropping it all the time.  The Airpods are just as bad. Removing them from my ear to put in the case was an adventure every time due to the small, irregular, and slippery shape.  Secondly, I got the best seal with the medium ear tips but something troubling kept happening. After a few minutes of talking, facial movement, etc., they would always work loose enough that the seal was no longer good and I kept having to push them back in. I tried different tips but just got worse results. These types of earbuds that only rely on the ear canal seal to hold the bud in place are really a non-starter for me and probably a lot of people. The best fitting earbuds I've always had had a secondary anchor like a wing tip to secure the bud in place. Unfortunately, the sound quality and the noise cancelation rely on a tight seal that couldn't be maintained. Thirdly, why did Apple put that stupid little button on the stem for control. The earbuds were already unstable in my ear and then I have to try to pinch the stem for music control without dislodging the ear buds? What happened to the regular Airpods touch controls with a tap? No way to control volume either unless you reach for your iPhone or your Apple Watch. You can always tell Siri to do it but when you're in an open office like me, that tends to annoy people. Bluetooth pairing is easy enough but one of the little gremlins in my Airpods was that when I switched between noise cancelation, off, and transparency mode in the control widget on my iPhone, when I went back and tried to use that functionality on the Airpods themselves later, it didn't work. Many times after I had paused the music from my phone, one of the Airpods would lose sound. It would still show up in the control center as connected but there just was no sound. I usually had to put them back in the case and take them out after a few seconds to get it working again. On a couple of occasions the sound from both Airpods stopped and I ended up having to re-pair them.  All in all, my worst Apple product experience. The design flaws were bad enough but maybe livable but I cannot deal with the Airpods not working like they should. That was enough for me to send them back. Very disappointing, especially at that price point.\", 'Ordered a new pair and a second pair that was a ‘used good’ pair and the used pair arrived with EARWAX in them, clogging up the mesh screen inside ear piece and also inside the case. They were still named ‘Ryans’ airpods. Returning - this is disgusting!', 'Only think it is a bit large hurts my right ear because there body is fat. Battery life is good it charges really fast I work about 8 to 10 hours and I have 2 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute I charge them during those break times and it lasts the entire time I work. The sound quality is excellent I love putting it in noise cancellation two stop all the noise because at my work is very noisy and be able to listen to my music without it even halfway up on the phone unlike my other headsets that I had with no noise cancellation I will pretty much have to have it at full blast to not hear everything destroyed my hearing I was getting ringing in my ears thanks to the new apples noise cancellation The ringing is starting to go away because I no longer have to blast music so I can hear it over all the noises anymore.', \"Apple AirPod Pro Yes, they are a bit on the expensive side. That's my only gripe. Really the gripe is that these are essentially a disposable item since you can't replace the batteries. The batts will start dying within 2 years, so that's a pretty expensive throw-away item. The good stuff is that the noise cancellation is pretty impressive for buds (non-can headphones). Actually darn impressive regardless of style. I can compare to the noise cancellation of my LightSpeed aviation head set which are great. If you can get a good fit on your ear (and apparently I can), then even passive noise reduction is pretty good. I really like the 'transparency' mode. Still great sound without isolating you too much from your surroundings. I'm getting about 3.5-4.0 hours of life under constant use. I use these pretty heavily for work (video conferencing). They charge up pretty quickly so you can go a whole day if you alternate - charge one while still using the other, then swap after 10mins.\", \"I bought a pair of these ear buds slightly used from the Amazon Warehouse and they arrived in 'like new' condition.  It was well worth the money I saved compared to buying a brand new pair from the Apple store.  I successfully paired these AirPods Pro with my iPhone X, an older iPhone 6, iPhone 5, 2019 iPad, and 2012 iMac.  The iPhone 5 and iMac needed to be paired manually like you would any other bluetooth device. I initially noticed a faint squealing sound in the right ear bud and a quick search on the internet shows that other people have experienced the same problem.  I updated the software on my iPhone and iPad and the weird sound disappeared.  The AirPods Pro are now functioning perfectly and I have been using them for a week with no further issues.\", 'Tried 2 times, had to send back, battery life was horrible, fully charged I would be lucky to get 2 hours listening time.  I would wear in gym fully charged, 1.5 hours later, they would be down to 20 %.  Final straw was after maybe an hour in gym, the last time, music was cutting in and out,  checked battery life, both buds were down to like 9 percent, both in the red, needing a charge.  I sent back, I have the second version regular Apple airbuds, never had a problem.  I ordered a set of noise cancellation Buds from master and dynamic,  going to give them a try.', 'Apple AirPods Pro comes at a heavy price but shows that Apple can keep customers wanting for more. The true wireless headphones that started a line off other headphones from other companies. Apple AirPods Pro has a nice fit, sounds great, and looks clean. The noise cancellation doesn’t truly cancel everything around the proximity. It reduces the sounds to a low standard that someone can still closely hear a distance sound. Great Noise Cancellation features are better with over-the-war headphones. Compare to other wireless headphones, Sony WF-1000XM3 truly wireless does a better noise cancellation. Apple option, Transparency Mode allows more outside noice. Apple did a good job with the ear tips. Not easily removed and stays on. This is a good start for a Apple Pro device for headphones. For those looking for a protective case I would recommend, Spigen Urban Fit.', \"I was so looking forward to receiving these noise-cancelling buds. But alas, I'm ultimately disappointed. Typically Apple has a decent product and I'm an Apple portable devices user. These fall short. First and foremost, the Airpods Pro do not justify the cost. With technology at  the level that it is today, I expect much better sound and much better noise-cancelling in this price range. My wired Bose earbuds blow these away and cost far less. Yes you have the wire, but everything from the sound to noise-cancelling is better. Last, I bought my first Airpods Pro pair in December. On a recent flight the right earbud died. Just died. After a long call with Apple, they suggested I take them to an Apple store for evaluation. Thanks, but no thanks. Amazon replaced them for me and the new pair arrived right away. Not sure I love them enough to keep them, however, the wireless feature including some noise-cancelling is a step in the right direction. We'll see. The price should be a major concern for you that love good sound and want better noise-cancelling. I can't compare them to anything else other than my wired Bose earbuds. Hands down the Bose win.\", \"I have been using a Bose QC20 for years for traveling, etc. Liked them so much that got a second pair when the first set's batteries eventually died. The fact that AirPod Pros got me to mostly ditch the QC20 (still keep them for plane rides needing a wired connection) says a lot about the quality of Apple's headset. They are comfortable, stay in place, have very good noise cancellation, and include excellent battery life. Transparency mode, new spatial audio improvements, and wireless charging are equally impressive and add to the overall experience. These are WELL worth the price, specially at the current discounted price point.\", \"(update) I got a replacement pair and this time worked perfect. I have been using my regular iPhone 7 earpods (wired) for quite a while and been quite happy with them, especially because I've been using a very effective and cheap earpod covers anti-slip, which completely changed the usability of those earpods. I also have a pair of Bose earpods that have noise-reduction but are also wired and the little box with the control for on-off for NR is quite annoying. So, after some initial time spent with the Airpods Pro, I can say I'm very happy with the sound quality, the NR is probably not as good as the Bose, but good enough, and overall they are very comfortable to wear. I've only used them for a couple of conversations, so I still have to evaluate how good they are for phone calls. ------ (initial review) I received a defective pair. Initial battery charged was done but while it showed 100% for the right earbud, the left was only ~85%. I then connected them to my iphone, the right earbud worked fine but the left did not work. I tried the factory reset but nothing changed. Sent back to get a replacement, hopefully they will work fine.\", 'When I first received the Airpods Pro, I was very impressed with their sound quality and noise cancellation. The sound is extremely balanced with a pleasurable amount of bass, and combined with the noise cancellation I never found myself needing to turn the volume up too much. Despite these things, I ultimately could not keep them due to their fit. When I first put them in, I assumed that I would simply need larger tips and that they would solve all of my problems. However, I quickly learned that the main body of the Airpods Pro made them rather uncomfortable. The problem I had was that the inner structure of my ear was too small for the body, and thus it would dig into my ear. While this problem may not apply to you, it was a dealbreaker for me. So overall, if these fit you, they are a fantastic pair of earbuds. However, be wary that the fit is not for everyone.', 'The noise cancelling is awesome, and don\\'t believe you\\'ll find better in a ear bud.  The fit is much more secure and stable as they sit inside your ear rather than kind of balancing/hanging on the outside. They are noticeably more comfortable in the ear - and the 3 sizes of tips allow for a more individual fit.  The big test will be exercising, but even just wearing them around and trying to shake my head from side to side they seem to stay in well.  I\\'ve also ordered \"memory foam\" tips, which will hopefully help the stability and sound even more. I like the \"transparency mode\" for normal activity, so you don\\'t get hit by a bus and/or you can hear people.  The noise cancelling is that good - it is immediately noticeable when changing over and blocks out the majority of noise, especially if music is playing at a medium or high level.  I suspect these would be great on a plane! Overall they are a huge upgrade from the regular Airpods, and much more targeted to activity and discreet appearance - i.e. the \"stem\" is significantly shorter and less noticeable.', \"I've used the standard air pods for over a year now with little to no complaints, they fit comfortably for hours during my jogs and hikes, but I was looking for even more of an escape from the distractions around me when in the gym and in public. Firstly, let me say that these are even more comfortable than the regular Air Pods, they have a bit of a lower profile and sometimes I can't even tell they're in my ear. But to the most important feature, the noise cancellation, it is astounding! The moment I put them in my ear before the adaptive features even began doing their work, I was immediately disconnected with everything around me but the music. If you're just wanting to read a book in a cafe, or enjoy a walk outside without wind blaring in your ear, you can have these in at all times even without your favorite music playing. I can't speak highly enough about this product, I am extremely satisfied, and compared to most wireless ear buds on the market they are honestly not the most expensive product I could have purchased. Though, let me say, you will get every bit of your money out of this product if you take care of them. Well worth it, and I hope you invest in these! They are incredible for reducing stress from any surrounding environmental factors when you're doing what you love out in the world or at home.\", \"So these are definitely real Apple AirPods - I went to the Apple store in my initial confusion around the terrible battery life and they confirmed they were indeed legit. Obviously given that its an Apple product, it's a pretty good product. I like the ear pieces and the ability to adjust noise cancellation on one ear and not the other, and customizing controls and whatnot - very useful given the small surface area to add buttons. The main drawback is that you have to be hyper-vigilant about battery. These died midway through a UAT work call and I was scrambling to find other headphones where the mic hadn't broken. I thought they died because they were faulty given they were charged an hour before. I went to the Apple store and everything, it was very embarrassing. It turns out, these bad boys last ~1 hour on teleconference and ~2 hours audio only. Given my meeting was 2 hours long, mystery solved. This makes it a little difficult to use them as work headset, but generally functional for personal purposes. It is annoying to have to be within 5 ft of the charging case to grab it and give them some juice regularly throughout the day. I am particularly bummed bc my Plantronic BackBeats which recently died (RIP) lasted 3 years and like 48 hours per charge and would regularly have enough charge to last me through the whole workweek. I'm getting used to this new way of life, but hope they make the next model's battery not suck as much as these.\", \"You've seen most long reviews and mine will be short\\xa0 What are the good things about it? 1. Join apple eco and IOS system 2. Fast pairing, it is connected when you take it out 3. Decent noise canceling/Transparency mode 4. Decent mic and sound quality 5. Lightweight\\xa0/Fit well 6.  Able to play a sound to find it. What are the cons? 1. Short battery life is short(3-4) 2.  The case has short battery life too. 3.  Sometimes, it will not show the battery status when the case is opened 4. Does not come with a cube Overall, if you are an Apple fan who is using the IOS system and don't mind spending $200+. The user experience and noise-canceling will be the most useful features.  But the sound is just fine and the battery life is not ideal.\", 'Hate the price but kids feel they r very important  because of brand name and being wireless. So if the budget is there its a good gift. HOWEVER if one is lost (it will surely happen) and they realize they have to buy the next set with their own money- the much cheaper wired ones become very attractive and our kids r seeing all their friends come to the same conclusion. So…', \"These Pros are good specifically for fitness, running etc., but not for everyday communication with your phone; they're too inconvenient, sometimes only one will work, then you will have to restart your phone, then they both work. This is a common problem amongst users. In about a months time, they will develop a slip and tend to be loose in your ear and by the way, I have very small ears, which really surprised me. The noise cancellation is really misleading. Now, the Transparency mode is somewhat useful as it will boost the surrounding sounds a bit. Overall, I don't regret buying them because I run about 20 miles a week in them and it beats having a chord swinging in front of me. So, you workout a a lot, or run on a regular basis, then these are good but I wouldn't advise buying them to just to keep in your ear for daily use. Hope this helps. I know, it does suck, I wanted them to be much better too, maybe one day.\", 'I am blown away by this noise cancelling feature! It’s awesome! I have gone through an LG Tone Active headset then when one of the earbuds gave out I bought one of those TOZO wireless earbuds and that one was pretty alright for the time being, but was hard for people to hear me, when I would talk to them on the phone. When I began using the AirPods it was a dramatic difference. The first phone call I made after I got them, I asked my husband if he could hear me and he said “Yes!” That was definitely a first since all the other headsets I would always be repeating myself or have to practically yell. I am pretty soft spoken though so it’s nice to be able to speak in my regular soft voice and be heard instead of forcing out loudness all the time, plus that can be exhausting after a long day of dealing with your kids and then still having to talk on the phone as if you’re barking at your kids all over again. Plus, my husband is a truck driver so we talk on the phone everyday and these are the best headphones that he’s been able to hear me in while inside his noisy 18-wheeler. So I would say these headphones were worth every penny!', 'They aren’t what is to be normally expected from Apple.  AirPods Pro are over-priced with middle of the road sound sound quality.  Trouble starts when working out.  Unlike the AirPods, the Pro version tends to fall from my ears even with the different tips. The noise cancellation feature is a bit of a headache and tends to make my ears pop. Using the controls on the AirPods themselves, for me isn’t as intuitive as the original tap method.  Squeezing the tip causes the AirPods to unseal from the inner ear and fall out. I personally should have stuck with the AirPods. It’s a definite ‘pass’ for me.', 'Apple used to say, \"It just works.\" Well, these AirPods Pro just work. It\\'s amazing. The hardest part of the whole thing is picking the right silicon tips so they fit correctly and comfortably in your ears. Which is to say, these are amazing. They work right out of the box; the sound is terrific; noise cancellation is awesome; the controls--pause and resume play of whatever you are listening to; bringing the noise cancellation to a level where you can have a conversation with someone (or hear the pilot or flight attendants, for example); and they sit pretty firmly in the ear once you\\'ve. selected the proper tips. Highly recommended--particularly if you already are in the Apple world, but even if you\\'re not.', \"The noise cancellation is great at the gym, inside planes and when you don't want to hear anything. I sometimes use this to go to bed if there's a noise disturbing me lol. Snug fit and although not great sound quality... good enough. Is it worth $240? No, but unfortunately its a one of a kind in its own category at the moment so its ultimately down to if you're fine with spending that kind of money. Personally its not the best investment I've made but thats only because I prioritize sound quality and this is a small upgrade in sound quality from the normal wired apple earphones. If you have an iPhone and arent a stickler about having the great sound (I would even call this mediocre) at this pricepoint then yes! go for it. This is great for calls and listening to music non-seriously all bundled in an easy wireless solution.However, I would avoid looking at this as the best listening solution for wireless... instead I would get this for being on the road/convience and get a real pair of on-ear headphones for more pleasurable listening.\", \"I accidentally left my air pod pro max headphones in the case in my pocket when I threw them in the laundry basket. My wife noticed a knocking sound when the clothes went in the dryer. She found my air pods and removed them.  She set them on the cabinet and assumed they were dead.  About four hours later, she told me so I put them in a container with rice to absorb any moisture.  The next day I tested them and one worked.  A few days later the other one started working. There is no impact from going through the washing machine. I find that amazing. Good sound quality, good noise cancelling, and reasonable battery life.  I had been spoiled to Sennheiser's and Sony's over the ear headphones so I can't call any of the main features great. However, the portability is fantastic and how about that water resistance!  I also likes that my iPhone notifies me if I leave them behind somewhere. I am definitely happy with the purchase.  By the way, I also like that I can connect them to my PC and Roku.\", \"I've owned my airpod pros for about a year and a half now. I've been in grad school while working, being a wife & mom of 3 kids, & trying to stay in shape. I listed to online lectures while I ride my bike, run, & workout at gym. I am certainly not blaring these lectures into my ears. About a month or 2 ago, I realized the high-pitched noise that rung constantly in my ears was not the cicadas of summer. I've owned several different earbud styles & brands, never had this tinnitus issue until now. I'm sad because I REALLY liked the airpod pros sound & noise-canceling feature. But now I am suffering 24/7, feeling like I walked out of a rock concert every waking moment. I completely stopped using the airpods. 3 weeks later...still ringing :(\", \"Not sure how I ever lived without these. As most professional reviewers have touched on the sound doesn't boom - especially the bass really relies on a firm seal with your ear, and especially if you are working out the seal can come and go so sound quality is hit or miss (I have $30 headphones that crush this for pure volume and heavy-hitting power.  However what it lacks in sound quality it more than makes up for in noise-cancelling.  I was at the gym the other day and there was awful music blaring on the overhead speakers.  I flipped on the noise cancellation, put on my own music at a moderate level and couldn't hear anything else.  Particularly the transparency mode is awesome.  I run and bike a lot in my headphones, and so safety is a concern to not be deaf to my surroundings.  for years I ran with only one headphone in and one hanging off, but with these there is no need.  I do wish it had a battery charge meter, but you can see that on your phone.\", 'I don’t know how to explain the usefulness without sounding like some apple fanboy, so just try it yourself. But to me, this is the best thing I’ve bought in years and if I had to buy them again for triple the price then consider it done. Seriously can’t hype them up enough, what an amazing product. Couldn’t be more happy even if the price seemed kinda steep at first. But now? Pocket change compared to what value it brings to my every day life. Blown away and will continue to buy these every time a new one comes out. That way I can walk around pretending I can’t hear people, even while on transparency mode (which actually enhances your hearing).  Noise cancel mode is the opposite, you hear nothing. It’s just such a useful product, if you’re on the fence just hop off and commit; you’ll be grateful you did.', \"Let me start off by saying that I am SO happy that Apple went ahead and made the in hear design headphones. I tried & I tried to make the original AirPod's stay in my ear, but they would continue to fall out. The original AirPod's did just not fit my ears, and I know there are a lot of people out there that can agree. WELL, let me tell you, you don't have to worry about it with these headphones. These AirPods go in ear, and they come with multiple ear tips to make sure you get the right fit. You can even go into the settings for the headphones and there's a feature that will let you know if you have proper fitment with the ear-tips. When I personally used the feature, my ears worked fine with both Small ear-tips & Medium ear-tips. Large did not work on me. The noise cancellation is amazing on these as well. I use the for just about anything. I was at a party once, and someone sent me a video on my iPhone. Luckily I had these in my pocket and I was able to put them on, tune everything out due to the noise cancellation and listen to my video. It was all so buttery smooth. I didn't have to wait for them to pair or turn on. I literally just took them out of my pocket and inserted them in my ear and I was listening away. They also try to keep the size of the original AirPod's. The case is ever so slightly bigger, but it is not noticeable at all unless you put the old AirPods and new AirPods Pro together. They still easily fit in that little pocket in my jeans. All in all, I am super happy that these are out, and I take them with me everywhere daily. I don't leave my house without them. Definitely worth the price if you want an overall great pair of wireless headphones.\", 'I wish i got these sooner. I hesitated to spend over $200 on these. So I bought other $20-$50 wireless earbuds. After about bad experiences with about 5 brands, I finally got to buying the apple option. They are truly well made and engineered. Sound is great. The noise cancellation blocks 100% of the overall buzz around you, but lets through about 20% of actual people taking next to you. I guess its imposible to block out all... can any brand do this I doubt it. Also seem less integration and change over from iPhone to my Macbook pro and back. This is the best part for me. I can use them for video calls in zoom on my mac and the move to a call on my iphone with a click.', \"If you want ANC, great audio, decent battery life, portability, perfect connection, and great call quality, the Airpods Pro are the only real option in the sea of the TWS earbuds. ANC/pass-through and the track controls will work out of the box. If you want battery life info, program Google Assistant, and music auto-pause if removed from ear, you will have to install a 3rd party app. I'm using MaterialPods, which costs about $1.50. With that app, you basically have all the controls that Apple users have. The only issue is that you can only toggle between ANC and pass-through. You cannot turn both off fully. You also cannot update the Airpods Pro. You will need to connect them to an iPhone and leave them connected overnight to update them. There is no force update option...you have to leave them connected overnight. Mine came with version 2D15, while the latest is 2D27. Apple made some changes to the ANC, so this update is necessary. Hopefully, they are now shipping with the latest version. Audio quality/fit: Highly subjective. I like the way they sound. If they don't fit correctly there are already thousands of third party tips to address your concerns. Other things that Apple just got right: - Force touch controls. The trigger area is bigger than a button but not as finicky as touch. - Call/microphone quality: Pretty much class leading. People can finally hear me clearly on a truly wireless headset. - Connection: I have never experienced even a second of stuttering or lag. Even the Galaxy Buds Plus connected to my Samsung S9+ never accomplished this feat. Conclusion: I really wish Apple would offer a first party app for Android users because the Airpods Pro are a truly exceptional product. They are leaving money on the table because out of all the headsets I have tried, the only one that comes even close are the Sony XM3s, which are extremely bulky.\", \"I had a cheaper pair of wireless earbuds that I was pleased with, worked fine for jogging, but they didn't sync with my iPhone like the AirPods do - and I love that I can talk on the phone with these and the sounds is great. I don't miss calls any more when I'm jogging since Siri let's me know right in the Pods that I have a call (I'm usually listening to podcasts or music when I jog). I have been disappointed in the noise cancelling feature because I can't get a solid fit (I guess, that's what it keeps telling me) but other than that, if you have an iPhone, get yourself some AirPods. They are worth it.\", 'So skeptically I purchased these as I tried and returned two “cheaper” single-pairing knock offs that claimed to be “as good”. Do not be fooled. These are excellent. Different level excellent.  The transparency mode is a dream for calls...you can hear your voice while u talk. The ability to intelligently switch from Mac products is a boon. Sound canceling is seamless when walking with a quick squeeze. And you don’t trigger the buds when pushing them in for a firmer fit. Sure, they’re about 3X the price of the rest, but they’re about 5X better. Better than Gen 1 by far, and I’m not sure how they’re going to improve on these for Gen 3. I was a skeptic, but these might be the best thing Apple has made in a long time.', \"I own both the 1st gen airpods and now the airpods pro. This is a temporary state, as I'm going to return the airpods pro this week. Everyone is losing their minds over these expensive little things, but there a few notable reasons why I don't think it makes sense to drop this much money for such a little upgrade over the 1st or 2nd gen airpods. * Regarding noise cancellation, the active noise cancelling leaves a few things to be desired. First, the new silicon seal alone keeps out noise much better than the hard plastic of the standard airpods--rendering the active noise cancellation kind of unnecessary and overkill. This alone isn't a functionality complaint; it just means the active noise cancellation is an expensive add-on. * Second, the noise cancellation only works when both airpods are in your ears. I typically wear one airpod at a time, and I really wanted noise cancellation to reduce the ambient noise in that ear alone. I understand this might sound foolish or like it defeats the purpose of noise cancellation, but those are my needs. And I bet many others have the same expectations. * The active noise cancellation creates uncomfortable pressure in my ears. Not a nuisance for a minute or two, but not something I want for the duration of a call or flight. I also understand this is not specific to Apple's tech, per se--lots of active noise cancellation technology does this. But this is a brand new, premium headphone--if the noise cancellation is uncomfortable, it's another reason to not use it and not pay for it. * Ear feel--this is a mixed bag. The fit is much more snug which means the airpods are much less likely to fall out and they block more noise passively. Great! However, it also means I'm much more aware of the bulb of the headphones in my ears--I can feel them all the time, as opposed to the 1st gen airpods which are better at 'disappearing'. For all of those reasons, I'm sending them back. I hope everyone else loves theirs without qualification! But you may want to test them out in a store before dropping the money, just to make sure.\", 'First of all I am a long time Bose fan. I love their sport free ear buds. I switched to airpod pros (my first experience) when I lost my Bose. Pros: 1. awesome connectivity through anything Apple. Apple TV (this is awesome I don’t keep my roommate awake if I want to watch a loud movie at night. Compared to my Bose their is no sound lag to picture and the connection is much better) iPod,iPad,iPhone. The last of which is an absolute lifesaver for anyone that uses this for phone calls. Clear and it cancels out a lot of your ambient noise for the other caller. 2. Battery life is really good in my opinion about 4-4.5hrs and the case holds another two charges which it charges very fast. (It also has a power management setting to preserve the battery through scheduled slow charging) 3. The noise cancellation is great. It literally makes it to where you can only hear you’re own breathing. 4. The transparency mode is really where this takes off. It limits the DB range that passes through so say a loud repetitive noice would be limited to a normal sound level. This needs a little more work since sudden loud sounds still creep through. But over all this tech is awesome. My friend and I both work around loud tools and we are able to hear people talking to us while the AirPods only let in normal range db. Very cool. 5. The spatial audio is very cool if you are watching a movie. It simulates surround sound. It also “moves” the sound when you move your head. It is very distracting when listening to like a podcast or music however and I would recommend keeping it off for those things. Or if you’re walking around. Cons: 1. The sound quality cannot compete with Bose. The bass isn’t as low and the mids aren’t as rich. Keep in mind Bose is all about sound quality and AirPods are more geared toward overall user experience. Having said that the sound quality is far better than any cheap headphones you’d buy. All I’m saying is they don’t compartiré to Bose.  2. They are difficult to clean and keep clean. Which wouldn’t be a huge issue, except that is there is any debris in the pod it won’t register as being in your ear. Just a slight annoyance. It can also cause a charging issue if something gets in the very bottom of the case and interrupts the connection between the wall of the charger and the airpod. TL;DR: overall I highly recommend this to any Apple user that wants ease of use with great features when connecting to Apple devices. They DO connect to every non-Apple Bluetooth device I’ve tried including my PC. I’ve yet to have issues when connecting to non-Apple. 9.1/10 since some of the tech still needs some tweaking, but I am very satisfied.', 'These have fallen out during every workout I’ve done and every run I’ve been on. They dropped out of my ears and almost fell into a river as I was running over a bridge. Today they fell out in the middle of my set and onto the filthy gym floor. Everything else about them is great although I preferred how the old AirPods had you tap to skip songs rather than the new physical button on the AirPod Pros, which is difficult to find for my large fingers.', \"I was really not okay with having to pay so much for these, but after using them I can say I feel like they were worth the price. I use them heavily from exercise to just listening to stuff at work. I do fall out on the occasion, but it's very noticeable when it'll happen and for the most point you will have an early warning. The noise cancellation is very good! I took advantage of it when on a family road trip when I just needed some me, my thoughts and music time. Helped me drive all those miles and keep my sanity. The battery life is crazy good and they can keep a charge for good portion of my eight hour shift.\", \"I've got Bose QC-30, Jabra, Sennheiser, and lots of other earbuds, but these are my everyday go-to's. The sound is very good, and the noise cancellation is reasonable for such a small unit. Battery life varies, and I seem to run out when I least expect it. The biggest problem is the slippery case and stems - I keep dropping the darned things! My Pros recently developed a clicking issue that was covered under Apple's warranty extension for this specific problem - I was impressed that they addressed the problem and replaced my buds without any complications, even thought the original warranty had just expired.\", 'Everything about this apple AirPod earbud is absolutely amazing EXCEPT the battery life! I have never had some earbuds that I had to charge every single hour. They don’t stay charged for crap!!! I strongly recommend that u find a good pair of earbuds some where else! The apple AirPods  just are NOT worth the money no matter how u look at it!!! FIND EARBUDS SOME WHERE ELSE AND STAY AWAY FROM THE APPLE AIRPODS!!!! If I could return them I would! The window has closed for me to return them!! I recommend Anker or something along those lines!!! STAY AWAY FROM AIRPODS!!', \"This was my first pair of Apple AirPods. I was nervous because I typically don't like Apple Earbuds - AND I have small ear canals (or whatever the technical term is). I always have to use the smallest rubber piece on all my other Earbuds. Maybe Apple finally listened to us small ear canal people!? These are great! They work well for phone calls and music listening. They stay in well while doing errands (laundry!), walking, and running. Honestly, the only watch out is if you've gone for a longer run and are sweating they sometimes they get a bit loose and you need to wipe them off and put them back in - but it's easily manageable. Definitely recommend! Very happy with this purchase!\", 'These are great. I have had multiple noise canceling earbuds and these by far have fit the best. Other brands are large and after a few minutes start to hurt my ears. The listen back feature is also better then all the other brands I’ve used as it doesn’t just sound like the microphone is turned way up just amplifying all the sounds, it actually just sounds like you have regular earbuds in your ears. Talking to people with them in is no problem at all. I’m not a big fan of the touch sensor becoming a physical button because what I liked about being able to just tap my old AirPods with my wrist if my hands were dirty or wet, now you have to squeeze the stem to change anything. I also really enjoy the automatic text message reading so I don’t have to look at my phone, I can just listen as soon as it comes in and reply immediately through Siri', \"Got the airpods last weekend and returned them back in 5 days! Good: 1. Sound quality is very good as long as you don't want bass. Good treble quality 2. Noice cancellation pretty effective. I live in a small studio and couldn't hear my refrigerator, barely hear my washing machine and dishwasher when listening to songs. 3. Easy to connect with iphone, macbook Bad: 1. I have experimented with all 3 earbud sizes but the airpods keep loosening from my ear over few minutes, until they are ready to drop moment I tilt my head. Even many video reviews, like on cnet which get commission from airpod sales, briefly show an important detail where the reviewers replaced the silicon buds with 3rd-party buds such as 'Comply' brand which are expensive. So imagine having to buy some premium 3rd-party earbuds because your $200 (on discount) airpods don't even fit properly. I found myself constantly adjusting my airpods even as I enjoyed the sound quality. 2. Packaging comes with charging cable with no wall adapter!! Luckily I could use the charging cable and adapter from my iphone, but if you don't have apple device, you might need to get your own wall adapter. So basically the packaging is incomplete!\", \"I've had both the Galaxy Buds (gen1) and Galaxy Buds Live before getting these. While those are good, the Airpods Pro really are the better earbud. Pros: 1.Audio Transparency is much better, sounds natural 2.Transparency works in both ears even when on phone calls 3. Phone call audio is in both ears 4. ANC is really impressive considering how small these are 5. Like these touch controls better, no accidental touches and triggering them doesn't push them into ears 6. Comfort is better, think I could wear these all day long 7. Spatial audio is insane, like you're sitting in your own movie theater. Sounds are all around you and the headphones track the ipads position and sounds shift as you move your head 8. Range on these seem much further. My ipad was inside in office and I went to walk the dog outside without losing connection 9. Sound quality is great. Make sure you use a tip that really seals and you'll get great bass response. Cons 1. Can't trigger Google Assistant when connected to Android 2. More difficult to put in and remove from case\", \"LISTEN - before you buy the Apple AirPods, spend the extra money to get the AirPod Pros - SO WORTH the extra money - and I know there are a bazillion knock-off brands that all claim the same quality, same noise cancellation, etc - I haven't found a pair yet that even comes close - you'll wear these for music, podcasts, phone calls, Zoom calls - everything - super comfortable, incredible sound quality and the noise cancellation is WORTH the price for the AirPods! I can actually wear these and mow the lawn and still hear my sermons and podcasts!\", 'I bought this like 10 months ago, they have been working perfect, when i started to use them i noticed a strange noise on the left one listening to electronic music, but it disappeared like two weeks later. For me are a great product, i use them everyday with my training and when I’m working. The only thing is the battery life, is only 7 or 8 hours, i think is amazing for a little device that battery but i still think is not good that you have to charge them everytime. Since i bought them and is very important for you to know, EVERY SINGLE TIME you get them into the case, they charge!, so, only use the earpods case when they are fully drained, i read a lot people who only have 3 hours of battery and they drain, and it’s because they don’t wait until they are fully drained to charge them again, this helps your battery life a lot!.', \"I tried these after seeing numerous 5 star rave reviews. Ultimately, within 2 weeks I returned them. No matter which ear bud tip I tried, they were uncomfortable and would start to hurt after about 20 minutes of wear time. This was probably the biggest deal breaker for me. Besides this, while the sound quality was fine, I didn't detect anything crazy impressive about it and sounded just about as good as a much cheaper pair of wireless earbuds I already owned that were more comfortable to boot. The ease of syncing to other apple products and the sleek and small form factor were definitely pluses, but overall, these just aren't worth the price tag you pay just because they're Apple.\", 'I use these primarily for blocking out noise while working in loud environments and for taking zoom calls. They\\'re really comfortable, the call quality and microphone are excellent, and they\\'re much more comfortable for multi-hour sessions than my pair of Sony XM-1000WF3 wireless buds, which get uncomfortable after an hour or two. The noise cancelling is way better than I expected - much, much better than the Sony XM-1000WF3. Also, the \"instant connectivity\" to devices (including my Windows laptop) and the ability to be connected to multiple Apple devices at once (iPhone, iPad, MacBook) without having to disconnect or switch is awesome. I was a little hesitant at first given the high price, but now I can\\'t live without these little guys and have definitely gotten my money\\'s worth compared to the hassle and discomfort of competing options.', 'The wife and I each have Iphones and Apple Watches and I wanted to complete the package so told her I was going to purchase us each a set of Airpod Pros.  She declined saying they were too expensive so I went ahead and bought a set for me.  A couple weeks later she was flying cross country.  She hates the constant droning and cabin noise of flying so I urged her to take my Airpods and just see if she liked them.  She called me after landing and informed me in no uncertain terms that should go buy another pair because I would not be getting mine back.  She LOVES them and so do I.  The sound is great and the noise cancelling is even better!  Pairing with an Iphone is as easy as opening the lid near your phone and the transperancy feature allows you to quickly turn the noise cancellation on and off with a touch of your finger.  Happy wife.....happy life!!', 'Women walking alone, beware. Please only wear one headphone so that you are aware of your surroundings. These work almost too well, and I realized after a few walks a single pod is the way to go. On the other hand, if you’re in a hectic household and need these to drown out the noise, both will do you just fine. Enjoy, these are well worth the cost. Oh, and they come with multiple sizes of inserts so you get them just right. And, in the event your phone falls out of your pocket on a walk or run, the distance they work before tuning out is about 800 ft.', 'I got these for my wife as a graduation gift because she was all over them when they got announced but ended up returning them after we both used them for a few weeks. As a lover of other apple products, I can’t get along with these either. Regular airpods fall out of my ears, these are so big they irritate them no matter how I twist them, and her complaint was the same, after an hour they hurt. Sound quality is good, but my $30 buds sound damn close and these certainly aren’t 8x better. Noise cancelling is legit, definitely a win with these and probably the only feature I thought was good. I also had problems pairing to my iPhone, but they work fine with my wife’s iPhone and MacBook, we both run the same software too. If I open the case next to my phone it would not recognize them unless I manually went into Bluetooth settings and paired them like my cheap earbuds. Also the lack of volume control on the buds is a huge fail on Apple’s part. Overall just not impressed, especially for the price, I know the overall package is nice and so is noise cancelling, but I can’t forgive that these cost $250 and sound only marginally better than my 2 year old off-brand $30 buds. One final issue is that their case is poorly designed. The lid doesn’t click into place firmly when open so the smallest handling error and the lid wants to shut. This happens more than you’d think considering how far the buds sit inside the case and how hard they are to pull out, often falling out as they slip from your fingers. When the lid is closed it rattles and twists back and forth like some cheap dinky piece of plastic.', \"I can't in good conscience recommend these. First, I loved them when they worked. They gave me constant problems. In two years I had two earbuds replaced and a case. Eventually the warranty ran out but the reliability problems did not. They are supposed to seamlessly connect to all your devices but that was not my experience. If I switched devices often, one airpod would stop playing sound and I'd have to put them in the case and attempt to reset them. Sometimes they would not reset and I'd have to leave them in the case plugged in for 24 hours and then magically they would reset again. What you'll find is these are fairly common problems. For the premium price I expected more. Maybe the regular airpods are more reliable, I don't know, but the Pros were not worth the price in my opinion. I finally got fed up with them not working and threw them in the trash when the warranty ran out. For comparison, I have a pair of Bose Sport earbuds going on 5 years now and the only thing to wear out is the Apple usb-c to 3.5 mm adapter.\", 'I took delivery of the AirPods Pro this afternoon and I am really enjoying the performance so far. Everything I read about the AirPods Pro before making the purchase is being experienced. The noise cancellation is awesome, the beauty of the sound quality is exquisite and the functionalities of the AirPods Pro made my decision to get them worthwhile. The inclusion of additional ear tip sizes for a perfect fit is brilliant and commendable. I have the option of having the AirPods Pro sit firmly in my ears as I go about my normal activities. I hope I continue to get great value for my investment.', \"I bought these for noise cancellation specifically and to see what a premium set of earbuds was offering. Noise cancellation is great, blocks out running air conditioning, background TV and a loud rotary fan. I wasn't aware of the transparency mode until I used them and read the manual. This feature took it from a great product to an amazing value. Noise cancellation offers me the isolation I want when I need it. Sometimes, you just need to be in your own world of quiet, Airpods Pro delivers on that. When I listen to my audiobooks, I want to be able to have someone ask me a question without needing to remove my earbuds, transparency mode also works really well for calming sounds like rainfall or a calming background music without making those sounds the only thing you hear. It offers the best of isolation from and integration with outside sounds with a long push of either stem. Works great for phone calls too, not much else to say about that.\", 'I’ve never really been one for the “newer tech” but decided to splurge on these after working from home with all kinds of background noise and finding out these are noise cancelling. I use them for just about everything- calls, anything I want to listen to on my computer or phone… I feel like I’ve gotten some productivity from this investment bc I’m listening to more audio books and finally able to make calls on the road. Always pay attention to the road first and drive with one AirPod in so you can still hear what’s going on. The sound quality is strong enough to where you don’t need both in. Thanks Apple!', 'I have the original Apple earbuds.  They sounded OK, fit fine.  The Pro version mostly delivered what Apple claimed IF you created a airtight seal in your ear...and that was the problem for me.  Even after using three sets of adapters, my ears were very sore after just a few minutes.  There was a iPhone test to see If the noise cancellation was effective by determining an effective seal. One ear had to be almost screwed in for it to register.  Point is that you either push in tight, or cancel the noise cancellation.  Anyway, they were never comfortable and hurt almost immediately.  Based on the feedback here, I am in the minority, so this is just a caution for some.  I think that switching to a alternative brand would cause similar problems.', 'I won’t take this time to give a review of the quality of AirPods Pro, both in terms of build and sound, because it’s well-established by audiophiles more competent than I that these sound wonderful in practically all respects. However, I am unpleasantly surprised at just how often these headphones become dislodged and/or slide out of your ears with just over 15 to 20 minutes of light use! I have tried all sorts of combinations of ear tip sizes and still the headphones keep sliding out of my ears, disrupting playback and stopping the noise cancellation function! I’m not jogging or working out in them, I’m just sitting doing work! I understand there are third-party ear tips out there and it might be worth it in my case to give them a try.', \"After only being used for sparingly (and I mean less than 4hrs in total for the ten or so days i had them) i started having battery issues with the left bud not charging fully. I purchased Applecare as I was expecting this perhaps a year or so into using them, but a battery issue should not be happening with such little use and them being brand new. I just decided to return them. This was the 2nd time i have ordered these. While they are decent and decided to give them another shot, for a premium product i guess I expected more for the price. I don't like returning items but sometimes you just have to.\", 'I love these so much more than the original airpods. The push option is better than the tap option of the old ones and these have more options. The nose cancellation option is WONDERFUL in a house full of noisy boys! Not only do you get a noise cancellation option but the original and an option to let in background sound (great for outdoor activities requiring you to be aware of sounds in you\\'re environment.) The battery life seems a little less than the original but that may be because of using noise cancellation? They charge fast too, going from 0-10% to 100% in about 30 minutes. There is a function called \"smart charging\" which adjusts charging on your own personal usage. So, I have quick charging from almost dead to full, but I have poor results when I charge them when they aren\\'t almost dead. I can\\'t really top them off quickly, the case will drain the pods THEN charge them. Turning off the \"smart charge\" option on my phone may fix this issue, idk, but I like the really quick charging from 0-100 so I\\'ve left it on. And if course the sound quality is what you\\'d expect from Apple. My only negative is that my left airpod irritates my ear. It rubs and has broken the skin making it painful to wear. The right airpod fits perfectly so idk if it\\'s a manufacturing problem or the shape of my ear. If it wasn\\'t for that I\\'d give 10 stars if I could.', 'All the added features you hear of with these iPad Pros are lost in the fact that they fall out of your ears all the time.  The silicone ear pieces are its greatest downfall, no matter how many times I tried the three differs sizes provided.  Apple needs to go back to the drawing board, especially given how much these cost.  Overall rating is low because it is hard to appreciate the other features when the ear pieces are on the ground.  I also found myself cutting off phone calls because I was trying to keep them in my ear; I would feel them falling, push them in, and hang up a call.  Very disappointed.', 'My upgrade to the AirPods Pro, it is definitely worth it.  I did not own any previous versions of the AirPods due to the fit.  Now, I love the fit!  Having small ears, it is always difficult to find ear buds by any manufacturer that I can use without them falling out or hurting my ears after extended wear.  I took a chance on these, as I own all things Apple except my ear buds.  So glad I did.  I took them out on several \"tests\" over the past week, and they excelled.  Sweaty at the gym, loved it...no slippage from my ears, great sound quality and noise cancellation was above average.  Noisy restaurant during happy hour, solid performance, barely able to hear any external sounds with cancellation on.  Flight to/from Orlando, impressed how little external noise I could hear.  Not sure if its due to the tech or just finally have a pair that fit well in my ear...LOVE them.  My only con is that you cannot control the volume from the pod itself; that has to be done from the phone.  Not sure if that can be a future upgrade, but it\\'s a small inconvenience for having a great fit, exceptional sound, almost full noise cancellation and true glitch free integration with the phone.  Nice.  Highly recommend these.', \"Im thoroughly impressed with what Apple has accomplished with the Airpods Pro. The sound quality is pretty good i must say (not like Audiophile level) but good. They have adaptive EQ which ensures that your music doesn't get drowned out by your surroundings. The battery is awesome. many people feel that the 5 hour listen time rating on these is not enough, but when you take into consideration the fact that you can listen for 5 straight hours of music before needing to recharge is not impractical. I used these at work during a 10-12hr work day, during my breaks i would put the airpods back in their case to let them charge for a couple minutes. Doing that got me a total of ~12 hours of music playback with noise cancellation enabled and they never once died on me. The noise cancellation is some of the best ive ever heard, id dare to say that you could use their noise cancellation feature as hearing protection in some cases lol. If you're paired to an iPhone, Siri will lower your music volume and read texts to you through the airpods and ask you if you want to reply or mark as read without ever having to look at your phone making the airpods a great option for driving. All in all, Great product and I Highly recommend them.\", \"UPDATE MARCH 2020 These still sound amazing, have great connectivity, great noise cancellation, and overall good value for the money. However I’ve discovered them to become quite uncomfortable for wearing for extended periods of time. Knocking off two stars. There is no getting around that these are expensive for little earbuds. I was skeptical about buying them because of that, but any skepticism was shattered when I first tried them. First off, the active noise canceling works at a level you'd only expect to find in much larger sony or bose full-on headphones. The sound and build quality are similar stories. It is a worthy upgrade from the regular AirPods. Connectivity, asides from very rare and minor hiccups (inevitable for all Bluetooth devices), is exceptional. Overall these are not only a worthy upgrade from the regular Airpods but a decent alternative to some higher-end full earphones from other companies if your goal is to have a single pair of earphones to do EVERYTHING than these are worthy of consideration.\", 'I bought these excited to upgrade from AirPods first generation absolutely love them been using the AirPods Pro for a couple weeks now the sound quality is good but the Lows in where the bass that is at is where they lack severely you’re better off buying a beats product or sol republic. Both of those would be better for sound and bass. The highs in the mid’s aren’t bad they’re really good they’re clear and crisp but Apple needed to focus a little bit more on the Lows in the bass. I’m not an audio file but I love my bass I love to feel the beat drop and the beat in the 808 drums in the kick drums in the music with these you cannot feel those you hear them but you cannot feel them. In some ways you can call it cheap audio but sometimes you feel a little bit of bass and it mixes well. But that’s very rare.  The transparency mode and noise cancellation are all right they work about half the time I want to say the noise cancellation works better than transparency mode. All in all if you love the apple ecosystem these will be great if you want a set of earbuds that have good sound these are all right but if you want earbuds that have good sound and good bass these are not it I’m sorry I love Apple I love AirPods these just don’t perform for the price they are asking for I will probably be returning these and getting something better for my money.', 'I had the previous AirPods, a hand-me-down. I wanted an upgrade & couldn’t pass up the sale Amazon had. What a great purchase! I was surprised by the size of the case, much larger than my previous ones. I don’t use the noise cancellation feature because I feel it naturally reduces the noise enough. I listen to podcasts & have no issues hearing the hosts talk. I took away one star for battery life. I use these at work, a normal 8hr day, & find that I have to charge the pods my last hr of work. I have to charge the case every 2 days. My previous ones I could charge the case once a week.', \"They don't have nearly the polish I'd expect from Apple: - Squeezing the stem usually clicks to show it registered, but sometimes it doesn't even when the squeeze was received. This means you're mixing up the commands, one vs two vs three squeezes. - One pod connects and the other doesn't, so music only plays in one ear. You need to put them back in the case and reconnect. - Audio phase error between the pods, sounds like your music has a strong echo. Reconnect to fix... - Pods show 100% charge, but one dies after ten minutes. Do another full charge and you usually get full listening time again. - Wireless charging issue where the case says it's charging, but ends up with less charge than it started with. - Randomly stop playing, even when music is streaming from the device. Need to reconnect to get the audio back. I don't fully regret them, but I probably wouldn't buy them again either.\", \"I was excited to try the new Air Pod Pro, but these are a big disappointment. The sound quality is good, but the noise cancellation is just ok in my opinion. My biggest issue with these, is they won't stay in my ear. I have tried each size attachment but they slip out constantly. I have already almost dropped them in the sink and toilet because they are not secure. I have tried the original version of Apple Air Pods and they stayed in pretty good (surprisingly), and I had high expectations since these claimed an even better fit. The battery life is also not as expected. I used to get around 6 hours of use with the original Air Pod, now I get maybe 3.5, even less than is shown online. Unfortunately they are not worth the price tag.\", 'The case has an issue where the AirPods will only charge when placed FIRMLY into the case (you have to wiggle it into place) before you close it to charge. If you simply place them into the case normally (AS A REGULAR HUMAN WOULD) then one of the charging pins doesn\\'t connect and TA-DA the AirPod doesn\\'t charge..... It\\'s nearly a daily occurrence when I pull out my AirPods and one of them is completely dead, the other is %100 and the case is almost full. also the best part is you NEED both in most cases. Unfortunately I WAS relying on them for remote work but I had to get rid of them, tooo many instances of me joining a meeting only to find out on the fly that one of these pods didn\\'t charge....... GOOD LUCK DEALING WITH APPLE, they won\\'t replace just the case according to the \"genius\" I spoke to. I initially thought the pods themselves were bad but it turns out its the design of the charging case.', 'I have been through various earbuds, some wireless and some corded, and only pair, my corded ones, had rubber ends in various sizes, which made them very comfortable, but the long attached cords were a pain.  My swinging arms, when out walking, would catch them constantly and pull out of my ears.  So time to splurge on AirBuds.  Waited for Black Friday and got a great price on the Pros.  There was no trouble at all connecting them to my phone.  It was instant, actually.  The noise cancellation is amazing but I turn it off just so I hear people say hello, or a car coming up from behind.  They stay charged so well and for so long, as does the case.  The rubber ends that came on them fit perfectly.  Very comfortable.  Well worth the price!  Just ordered a cute leather case to put the original case in.', 'In the designing of the Apple earbud, they advertised the fact that they scanned the ears of over 300 people to come up with the shape for the perfect, most comfortable listening device. To this day, and factoring in several purchases of true wireless earbuds across the entire price spectrum, the Apple earbud and AirPods are the most uncomfortable earbuds I have ever worn. The Apple AirPods Pro are the second most uncomfortable I have ever owned. The noise cancellation is excellent. Silences all sounds so I can really focus on the ringing headache from pain of wearing these things. The transparency function is the best I’ve experienced so far as well, lacking the typical echo and mono sound of other brands. You’ll love them.', 'Like you, I was nervous if this would be legitimate or not. It\\'s way cheaper than on the Apple store and it\\'s buying through Amazon so that alone could provide fakes easily. But I ordered them, and when they arrived they were in legitimate packaging: plastic wrap around the box, the box itself, the model number, it came with all the accessories (charging cable, different size ear buds, the case). The earbuds work great. I\\'m on android, s20+, and am planning on getting an iPhone later on. But they work great on an android phone. The noise canceling is phenomenal, coming from someone who came from old Bluetooth headphones. You can\\'t use the \"Hey siri\" to turn the volume down obviously but they\\'re still great and have great control in the steam of the earbuds. Because there\\'s that indent, it feels more like pressing a button rather than just randomly tapping around, which I like. Overall I\\'m very happy with my purchase!', 'I only have one complaint. Apple didn’t thing about people with smaller ear canals or different shapes of the tragus and antitragus at all. I know the tips are designed to create a seal so the oise reduction can work. However, the also slow push the buds up out of my ears. I have to constant reach up and set them back in. So, I won’t be able to workout or run with them like I did with my airpods that sat in perfectly and never fell out even during handstands and such. My airpods had that left airpod going half volume issue and I was excited to get the airpod pros. Unfortunately I have to fiddle with them constantly. Maybe I can find some 3rd party tips that won’t give me issues.', 'I bought these for my daughters birthday. One AirPod had a consistent static in it. She thought I’ll just take them to Apple and see if I can exchange. What she found out was that they had been purchased from an Apple store in April 2020!!! I am so offended!  Apple said they’d do a diagnostics on them at no cost but that they have probably been tapered with. If they don’t offer to exchange them. I am sending them back for a refund!  Not good Amazon! Not good. The hassle of my daughter having to go to Apple twice to fix a problem that someone knew existed before they sold the USED product.  Very disappointed.', \"Arrived perfectly and quickly! It works great and I love it. Use it everyday and don't have any complaints for now. One of the best earbuds I've used. Sound quality: 9/10 Noise cancellation: 9.5/10 Battery life: 9.2 Looks: 9/10 Phone quality: 9.5/10 Features: 10/10 --- Overall: 9.37 In conclusion, I highly recommend this product, for the buck it really does give me what I wanted and needed. I use it for work and listen to music on my free time. So if you're looking for a phone call friendly earbud and/or earbuds for great music listening, then this is for you. Of course, you have to set a aside a couple of bucks but you can get it with a discount offer here on Amazon or just but it at its retail price here too. Whichever is worth it.\", 'I didnt even open the box to find out that this was a fake airpods. I checked the serial number with Apple and they could not recognize it. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. ITS FAKE', 'I use these daily for about 8 months. I contacted apple support for connection dropping and poor noise cancellation, they sent me replacements and they preform no better then the originals. They seem to have gotten worse after an iOS or firmware update and are extremely poor at noise canceling to the point where when turned off it’s the same effect. They were good in around February then went to hell. Battery life is around 2.5 hours, also poor.  Apple marketing five stars, AirPod pros one star. Look elsewhere people and save your hard earned money.', 'First I thought they we’re overrated; I got me another set of earphones before I got the Apple ones which I really liked the sound and bass was deep crisp, also with noise cancellation, water proof, and way cheaper! The battery life was similar, and they cost just a fraction of the other brand’s price, however, I tried these AirPods to see if they really made a difference… to my surprise, they do! Very clear sound, although the bass is not as deep as the other one, the clarity of the music is really good! Even better, the connectivity to my iPhone is automatic, I can text, answer calls, command Siri, etc… without having to grab my phone to do it; the most important thing for me is the comfort of the AirPods, I can’t rarely feel them when I wear them, and unfortunately the other ones, there’s a point where I have to take them out because my ear starts hurting!   The reason why I don’t give straight 5 stars is because I have issues with some connectivity when I get calls for example, Siri won’t obey my command to answer without having to press the AirPod nor wants to connect to my AppleTv. Other than that, GREAT!', \"There is a fatal flaw in the design of this product.  During phone calls, it over-amplifies extremely quiet background noises to the point that it blasts the ears of the other caller, and it simultaneously mutes the person's speaking voice. Simple quiet background noises such as someone taking off their coat, turning the page of a book, or typing on their keyboard become painfully loud noises to the person on the other end of the call.  Its insane.  Google this flaw... it is widely known! I've returned/exchanged my pair numerous times, and nothing improves.  It is a universal design flaw that Apple is responsible for.\", 'I tried low end earbuds ~$40 and I wasn’t happy with the muffled sound.  However, the thought paying $200+ for  earbuds too much.  So, I bought Creative’s mid range units at $80.  I’ve kept these as they were a big improvement over the cheap ones.  They are hard to connect to my iPads and I didn’t think I was hearing all the jazz I was listening to. I finally gave in after reading all the rave reviews of Apples top AirPods.  Well, they’re great, by a large factor.  I can hear the umph in the music as well as background brush strokes on the symbols.  I still wonder about Apple’s other, mid-level units which got high reviews...? However, these connect effortlessly to any Apple device they’re next to, AND without reading a manual.  Further, the controls are minimal and you learn them automatically, on screen when you first connect.  Overall, I like them well enough to keep even though I cringe at the price of these little used accessories =&', 'I purchased these through Amazon Warehouse.  They were advertised as \"like new\" condition.  NOT!!   They were filthy, and not even factory reset.....still bearing the previous owners name/settings. With the previous owner\\'s ear wax still all over the ear pieces..... they are not going in my ears!   Case has chips and dirt around the lid edges, and the charging port has \"gunk\" in it.   What\\'s ironic is the box has a \"Inspected/Amazon Warehouse\" sticker on it..... maybe they looked at the box long enough to put on the sticker, but did nothing else.  How in the world could a product in this shape be sold as \"Like New\"??  RETURNING!', \"The bottom line with the AirPods Pro is that they are too expensive for the nice set of features that they include. Maybe I'm the outlier but they still don't feel secure in my ears and they just don't sound that good. The noise cancellation and transparency mode are great and I hope to see those features in all future versions. The ear tips are a nice change from the original airpods and I think the next version of the pros will really nail it but these are a pass for me.\", 'The sound quality is pretty good. The battery life could be better. My biggest complaint is with Apple in general. There is a reason I buy one product from Apple every 15 years. Proprietary products, and they make things way more complicated than they need to be. They want you to spend more money than you need to, and they try to save every penny they can. How do you not include a charger with a product? You cannot download firmware updates unless you have other Apple products? You cannot make adjustments to the Airpods with EQ and such in an app? No app to find your Aipods? Only other Apple products and charges you already own facilitate in the basic operation of the product? They think this gets customers to buy more Apple products, but it really has the opposite effect. It makes me want to steer clear of Apple even more. Apple is literally the only company I know that pulls this garbage.', \"I am always concerned about getting a counterfeited Apple when not buying directly from the company's store.  Amazon is not immune to fakes, so make sure you check your Apple product serial numbers got genuine origination. What I received was the genuine Apple product at a price that you won't find anywhere else. As you already know, these are awesome, so I won't go into the details. get them, you won't be disappointed.\", 'For some people who want to buy an used pair or an open box here is for you Warehouse deal… Mine ones cost $130 At first impression the box was very damaged and full of other no sense stickers The airpods was inside the charging box, with different ear tips sizes Notice at first turn on the case was uncharged and my iPhone recognize this as “Paul airpods” and I’m not Paul All the accessories was inside the box Also the paperwork The case was a little dirty with a little scratch I was able to check the AirPods on apple site and was legit pair of apple AirPods Pro, the warranty for other side is a little hard to claim, need to call and send the proof of purchase with no answer yet The sound quality for me is a little week on the bass but it’s okay for all the other features that the airpods offer… The apple ecosystem is nice to be into! But maybe trying a pair or beats in-ear (also now owned by Apple) Update two day had pass… the right one keep falling from my ear and I’m a big and tall person… maybe not good for small persons with small heads', \"Before I start this review, I want you to understand where I come from. I am an audio engineer, and by extension, a bit of an audiophile. Since I need to be able to hear everything in the songs and sounds I'm working on, I have developed high standards, especially since I use high end studio grade headphones and I have grown accustomed to them. All of that being said, my daily driver on my PC is the DT770 Pro. I absolutely love the sound, but I wanted headphones that delivered similar sound quality while away from the computer. That's where the Apple AirProds Pro  comes in. These headphones sound VERY close to the DT770 Pro, and those headphones are an order of magnitude larger than the AirPods Pro, so you could I was very shocked to hear this level of sound quality in such a small package. Very flat EQ. Slightly lacking in bass, but it is easily made up for with it's Noise cancelation. The noise cancelation on these headphones are pristine! I take the train a lot for commute, and these headphones drown it all out. Now, of course, it doesn't drown EVERYTHING away, but play a song and you absolutely wont notice any noise you may hear otherwise. The size of the case and headphones are so conveniently small and it fits virtually anywhere! The headphones are also extremely lightweight and comfortable. They have a nice grip on the ears yet feel light as a feather and you forget you have them on sometimes. Despite it's light weight, it's a tank. I have accidently dropped them from head level sometimes and they haven't been affected by it at all. A neat bonus to it all is spatial sound which makes supported videos more immersive! The only real complaint here is with the battery life. If you wanted to use these for work, they wont even last long enough for a part timer. Most of this is due to the active noise cancelation. However, the upside is that the case will fully charge the headphones in about 15 minutes! Overall, I have fallen in love with these headphones. As an audio engineer, I can guarantee you this will deliver sound quality you won't want to go back from.\", 'Fantastic earphones! To be honest I don’t find these type of earphones the most comfortable but you get used to them. The sound quality is great and it’s crazy how effective the noise cancelling is. It has 2 modes, so one is perfect so that you hear ambient noise if you’re running for example but the noise cancelling is so unexpectedly effective! It’s also super convenient to just wear one so that you can answer your phone or do a quick catch up on the news etc. Generally they don’t fall out but you must make sure they’re in securely. My only gripe is the battery life. I think if you’re listening to music/ using constantly it seems to only be 3/ 3.5 hours. The case is charged so you can give them a tip up or 2 quite easily. Make sure you have the correct cord and only buy the originals and register them online for your warranty.', 'Noise cancellation is decent. Battery life is meh. They will last a couple of hours with noise cancellation on, then back into the case they have to go. The worst thing: They ACTIVELY seek to pop out of your ears. Above-average Inner-ear diameter? Oily skin? Earwax? Didn\\'t take a shower 5 minutes ago? Pop! Off they go. (And they aim for trash bins, open drains and toilets.) You can add some springy wraparound fins which help alleviate this somewhat, but this means the case never closes so they\\'re always in pairing mode/draining case battery. Also spectacularly bad: - Pairing mode. I don\\'t need a battery status card that I have to manually dismiss every five minutes, Apple. Does this mean they\\'re now actively paired to the device? Unclear. - Connection/disconnection control access: This should be the first thing you see when you swipe up or click the Bluetooth menubar option. You connect the device via Bluetooth and send sound to them through Sounds. Ugh. Definitely not on the pop-up card either. That would just be too magical. - Interoperability: Unlike other BT headphones, these pair via AppleID to the devices on your Apple account. They do not work with older AppleTVs or Xbox OneX. - They do not work with Microsoft Teams, if that is part of your needs. (You have to specify calls ONLY go through the AirPods in Teams, and not through the system. Yes, it\\'s an issue with Teams, but don\\'t expect a fix from Apple OR Microsoft.) - \"Hey Siri\" gets confusing through these because you never know which device they\\'re connecting to. With the case open, because of the fins, they constantly switch around, draining battery even when not in use. - Spatial audio: Wow, my computer sounds farther away! Wow, if I turn my head I can only hear it in one ear! I\\'m still waiting for a time when this ends up being useful. - Surround sound processing through spatial audio: Do you dream of cheap surround sound via Spatial Audio? Nope. Unless you\\'re watching all your movies from your computer or iPad screen, not gonna happen. And Spatial Audio is NOT the same as Atmos for Headphones, or even similar. Spatial Audio is ONLY about where your head is vs the screen. There\\'s a bit of a spatial effect for Surround-mixed recordings including foreground/background effects on some movies, but it\\'s not dramatic enough to make it worthwhile—more like the standard 5.1 to 2.0 conversion you\\'d get on a surround receiver. (Side note: Atmos for Headphones is pretty impressive if you\\'re able to remove out interim processing and get a straight 2.0 signal). If you want to watch movies quietly, know that the audio balance trends towards tinny at normal listening levels and can\\'t be adjusted. Wired over-ear headphones sound better and don\\'t get lost in the bedsheets. Maybe version 2 will be better.', 'AirPod Pros were DOA.  Made every attempt to connect them, contacted Apple Support directly, and chatted with Amazon support.  Amazon would only accept a return not a product exchange.  This would have resulted in a loss of $80 as the Black Friday promo price would no longer be honored.  I had shared the deal with others last week which resulted in 4 additional unit sales.  As a loyal Amazon customer, I am quite disappointed by the lack of options in this transaction.  Instead, I am working through Apple directly even though the exchange process is more cumbersome.', 'I paired these with my new iPhone 13 Mini and I was completely blown away with the clarity and quality of the sound. A great investment. It makes all the other earbuds I have sound so muddy. It also fits my ears nicely and stays in place. They were instantly recognized by the iPhone 13 Mini and no hassles in setting up and it quickly reconnects each time I use the. Worth the little bit extra $$ to have no regrets. This is definitely top of the line sound that is so clear. Even on YouTube Videos that I listen on my MacBook with a sound bar, this sound far exceeds that. A big step up from speakers and most headphones.', \"Update: I requested to have my air pods return but later spoke with customer service to have them replaced. The new AirPods are working much better. I have not been disconnected once today. Yay! My advice with anyone experiencing the issue below is to simply return or exchange your AirPods. Overall I’m very happy with my new and well functioning product. —————————————- This product is $200. It constantly disconnects. I have a two-day-old I pad air and a 6-month-old Ipone 11. I received the airpods today. Why aren't they working??? I have no intentions of keeping a product that doesn't work and is giving me problems on day one. Keep your money or spend it elsewhere. I'm gonna do my research and seak for another product. I suggest you do the same. Very disappointed. Returning asap.\", \"I had never used noise cancelling headphones of any kind. I now describe it as putting in good earplugs but also being able to listen to what you are listening to on the device you are connected to. It just mutes all the outside sounds which used to drown out what I was listening to with my old AirPods. These also have a Transparency mode, which amazingly lets you have a conversation with someone close by and hear them better by making other sounds mute. I noticed when I was having a Skype video chat with my brother, there was a hissing noise coming from somewhere. I put in the AirPods and put them on Transparency mode and I could hear my brother better without the hissing noise interfering. The only thing I don't like about AirPods is that you pay a lot of money and the batteries only last a couple of years. At least, my old AirPods are having battery problems after 2 years. Other than that, these are great. They stay in my ears better than my old ones also.\", 'So I bought these on a Black Friday sale but it was back ordered for a few months. I bought some cheap Tozo wireless headphones to hold me over. A very worthy competitor. Compared to the $30 Tozo headphones, these AirPods do not allow the user to control the volume by tapping on the ear piece. As the cheap headphones had this feature, you can imagine I was upset when I realized Apple did not have this basic feature. The bass is also not as defined as the cheap headphones. What Apple did do perfectly was the sound quality. While I am a stickler for sound quality and comfort, Apple did get it right. The bass in the AirPod Pros are good enough but I would appreciate more. The AirPods are the go-to. The AirPod features that are futuristic is Siri reading text messages, the option to ping (beep) and locate a lost earbuds if it is nearby, and there are other features that I am still learning about. Overall, I am rather satisfied. If the case had more lights showing the battery status and connection like the cheaper Tozo version, this would be great. For these reasons, I give it a 9 out of 10.', 'A less than obvious feature of the Pro buds is their ability to function as hearing aids.  Take an easy app-based hearing test to let the iPhone learn your hearing capability, and let the phone optimize the ambient-listening profile.  Not as comprehensive as a full audiologist session, but for my mild losses, it\\'s a pretty noticeable improvement.  Of course, with a squeeze of the right bud stem, it changes among the options for ambient and noise-cancellation modes. For listening to music they are great, great also for phone calls.  They pair with my PC to function in Zoom calls, maintaining the \"hearing aid\" profile defined in the Phone even when not connected to the iPhone. Wish they came in black.', 'I was looking to combine my Bose QuietComfort 20 wired earbuds that I used for travel/noise cancelling with a good pair of wireless earbuds for working out (was currently using the plantronics backbeat fit 3100 and was pretty happy).  Wanted the convenience of one pair for everything, active noise cancelling, great sound, and ability to hear surroundings safely.  Was initially very impressed with the connectivity and features of these in conjunction with my iPhone XS max, but the sound quality for my music was only ok even after tweaking the sound settings as much as possible.  Found the Boom EQ app and that was a game changer!  Customized the eq to have high peaks on the ends and a deep valley in the middle was MUCH better.  Combined that with a good set of memory foam tips.......VERY impressive sound now, plus the tips help these stay put while exercising/sweating.  Highly recommend this setup.', 'I was looking forward to these. Within two full days of use, I noticed that I am constantly pushing these earbuds back into my ears. I\\'ve tried all three size earbuds that come in the box (s,m,L). None of them stay in your ears. Especially when you are chewing or talking, the earbuds slowly slide right out until they fall out of your ears. I have a $10 pair of wired earbuds that DO NOT have this issue. The cheap pair stays in my ears when I eat, sleep, and talk. Apple Airpod Pros do not stay in your ears. Second issue, \"ear fatigue\" when using the noise-canceling function. I noticed this as well. Your eardrum starts to hurt after a while. It\\'s a slight mild pain but it\\'s not an enjoyable experience using this product. Save your time. Do not buy these headphones.', 'Apple made a solid effort here, but I’m disappointed with these for two reasons.  First, they keep falling out of my ears.  It’s not the size of the ear cups that causes a problem (3 cup sizes are included), it’s the shape.  The part of the cup that goes into the ear is slightly rectangular shaped and it just doesn’t fit my ear.  Second, the noise cancelling works well at certain mid- to low frequencies, and not at all with some higher frequencies.  The result is an eery background noise that proves to be more distracting than helpful.  Noise cancelling is better left to the earmuff style headphones, which work much better in my experience.', 'They work great for about two weeks. Then the left one just went completely unresponsive even though my phone still shows that it’s on and charged. Even with buying Applecare Apple refuses to send me out a whole new set and will only send me the left replacement airpod after I spend half a day driving an hour away from my house to the only Apple store around here. This is some of the worst customer service I’ve ever had in my life.', 'The transparency mode is awesome. Then the ear test, excellent idea. At first the comfort wasn’t great, I guess my ears just needed to get used to something in them. Can hardly tell they are in there.  Riding my bike I hear no wind, unlike the AirPods, I had to buy little rubber things to put on them. The sound, great. I don’t need to crank them up to hear it all. No distortion when I do. I hear everything clear as a bell.  The problem I was having with the AirPods that I don’t have with these is that wen I would sweat real bad the others would stop plying as if I took them out. Which is pretty often being that I live in Florida and fix air conditioners for a living. It’s hot everywhere I go. The noise cancellation that’s awesome too. I can hear my son, girlfriend, the tv but don’t  hear the fish tanks slashing water or the washing machine running. Like it knows what I wanna hear and don’t wanna hear.', 'Owned the 1st gen AirPods. I love them until I dropped and broke them. I decided to upgrade and get the AirPods Pro. I really couldn’t see how they could improve the Pro over the regular AirPods but Apple did. The noise cancelling is great. When it’s on, you can’t hear unless someone is screaming at you. I never had an issue with the fit. To me it’s perfect and I never had an issue where it just falls out. I like that you have a choice of turning on modes for noise canceling, transparency or just off. I like the size of the pods and the charging case. I use it more for talking to people on the phone so I’ll use one AirPod and when the battery is low, I just switch so I can always have an AirPod that’s fully charged.', 'First, the product detail said there would be  3 different size eartips. I was counting on that as I have very small ear canals, and I already knew having the \"bud\" in my ear wouldn\\'t stay put and would be painful. I thought that since it would come with S, M and L tips, I would have a chance. I tried to communicate with Amazon customer service- that is a exercise in futility and a discouraging use of time. I WILL NOT EVER BUY A BRAND product such as APPLE off of Amazon. Just go straight to the store where you can make sure you have what you need. . I probably am going to return and buy at the store. What a hassle. I also can not get the airpods paired with my Windows based laptop. Works fine (except wont\\' stay in my ears) with my iphone and my ipad. Addendum to my review. Rather than going through the hassle of returning this for the sake of ONLY needing eartips that fit - I wound up buying some. A little ticked about that still and the process. The size small tips seem to be doing the trick. I also ordered the ear hooks that fit into the upper chamber of the ear. I feel that the buds are now secure, they are pain free, and they work. BUT whoever QC\\'d the packing and the AMAZON process sucks for a product of this type. BUY AT THE STORE, not through mail order!', 'They sound great. For me, they are comfortable. One earbud has fallen out several times even though the airpods say they are fitting correctly. Noise cancellation is pretty amazing. I love transparency mode. They struggle to connect 3 out of 10 times. Once they are connected, they stay connected. I don’t think I’ve ever had them drop. They hold a charge very well. They recharge inconsistently - sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. Overall, it’s a bittersweet experience considering how expensive they are. I’m not ready to say that this is my last pair of airpods, but I’ll definitely see what else is out there when these give up. I recognize that there is a silly amount of advanced technology in a tiny package. Really remarkable stuff. But... I still want reliable connection to my device.', 'I wanted to give these a perfect score, and almost did, based on sound quality and features. But first, I had to wear them for a week and test the comfort.  And sadly, these are the most frustrating headphones I’ve ever bought. The nibs just won’t stay in my ears and I have to adjust them every 30 seconds. They come with 3 sizes but none of them have enough grip to hang on to my waxy ears. And to make matters worse, the controls are super sensitive. So each time I push them back in, they cutoff (interrupting the music or phone call). Compared to other earbuds, the sound quality is superior and you can really notice the noise cancellation. The case is small and it can recharge wirelessly.  They pair up with my iPhone and laptop very easily and sound great on phone calls (for a minute until they fall out). I got a pair for my partner and she had the same experience.  If Apple would design a better silicon tip that will stay in place (like Bose maybe), I would probably buy them again.', 'First of all, the free overnight shipping was amazing.  I woke up to the package at my door before 8am and spent the morning setting up the Airpods.  The pairing process was seamless and took about 15 seconds.  I will provide an update once I have some time to use these but so far, I’m really liking the comfort, sound quality, and ease of setup.  The rubber tips are an amazing quality of life upgrade from the previous Airpods.  Other sized tips are included for different ear shapes.  One negative aspect I have read about these is the battery life being so low.  4 hours of use is really poor for the price.  Here’s hoping this won’t be a huge issue.', \"I've always purchased lower end Bluetooth headphones that I thought did their job well; but this is a significant difference! I also have a set of AirPods 2nd Gen that my wife uses and she was impressed with the noise cancellation and sound. It's one of those items that you wonder why they are so expensive and then once you try them, you can't see yourself without it. Now, the only issue I have is that there is a popping sound that occurs whenever the music is paused and it is either on noise cancellation or transparency mode. It seems the mic and speakers are trying to compensate for noise, but it is doing too much and creating a popping sound and white noise. The popping sound is enough to create a slight disturbance, it similar to when you may yawn and hear popping in your ear. However, this one does not feel so good as your ears are not relieving pressure. I imagine it is an issue that could be fixed with firmware, but in the meantime, anytime I pause music, I get the annoying popping sound. I may return them and see how another pair fairs.\", '', 'Apple AirPods Pro seem like very nice bluetooth earbuds, but they are a little pricey (like all Apple products). The quick touch on either pod has a number of different features for easy access, and three different sized ear pieces are available for comfort. The batteries seem to last hours, and the wireless charger will charge them about 3-5 times (depending on the battery left in the AirPods). You can charge the case with a wireless charger or the included micro usb-c to lightning charger; does not include a usb-c charging base. The noise cancellation and translucent modes actually work really really well. Overall, pretty happy with these; I did not own a pair of regular AirPods, but I would say these ones are way better.', \"The Airpods Pro sound quality is as good as my Bose QC35 for me.  Granted, I do have some hearing loss so perhaps I'm missing out on some of the subtle sound differences.  Although the left ear showed a good fit immediately, I had some problems fitting my right ear according to Apple's fit check.  Eventually got it.  Overall, very comfortable.  Love the addition of the ANR as it makes sound pop and is great in an office environment to tone down background noise even if I'm not listening to music. Outgoing voice quality is very good over the phone based on feedback from others as well as listening to my voice recording. However, I find that the ear adapters seem to push the Airpods Pro out of the ear after 15 minutes or so (old Airpods didn't do this).  This not only allows more outside noise in, but also sets them up to fall out during workouts or heavy head movement. Left ear fell out right at the end of a spinning class today as I got off the bike for example. I've decided to keep them for now and hope that other ear adapters become available soon.  It was a toss-up though....\", \"But I'm actually really impressed. I had an old pair of bluetooth noise cancelling I got for free at an event that were worn down. I was nervous about these because they're so expensive. They're definitely worth it. The noise cancelling is great, especially because I have multiple air conditioning window units that are a lot of background noise. I've had some issues with my ears getting used to them and being irritated but over time that's gone away. Sometimes I feel like the seal isn't great in my right ear but it's nothing awful. I definitely think there's needs to be a smaller size than the small silicone cover. One thing that drives me nuts is when I answer phone calls, it never goes straight to my airpods, even when I had something playing with them when the call came in. It's always a few second delay of me trying to switch the sound back to airpods.\", 'These have fantastic sound quality. Noise cancellation is great. I’ve ridden around mowing the lawn on a 23HP diesel lawn tractor and I can barely hear it when noise cancellation is active. One thing that surprised me is this…if I can describe it. I’m listening to tunes on my iPhone, phone is in front of me, I turn my head to the left, and the left pod volume decreases slightly. The effect is like I’m turning my head away from a speaker sitting in front of me. Does the same thing when turning to the right, except on the other ear of course. Also, they fit really good and don’t make your ear sore for extended wear time. Extremely satisfied customer here.', 'The overall sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life, construction, and functionality of the Apple AirPods Pro was exceptional . . . truly excellent.  However, unfortunately, I was forced to return the AirPods Pro for one simple reason . . . . they would not stay in my ears.  They came with three different size ear pieces and I tried them all but none would keep the airpods from falling out eventually.  I never left the house with them because I was afraid I might lose one.  Once I stretched across the empty bath tub to hang a towel and one fell out into the tub.  After bouncing around like a dice, I put it back in and it worked just fine so I believe the airpods are constructed quite well.  I  don\\'t believe it would be right for me to subtract stars because of a personal physiological issue . . . . that is not the fault of the Apple AirPods Pro.  I did not want to try any of the suggested fixes such as memory foam ear piece replacements.  I simply wanted them to work as is.  However, what I chose as a replacement was the Bose QuietComfort 35 II and I haven\\'t looked back.  I believe the \"over-the-ear\" NOT \"on-the-ear\" ear cups are truly the best way to go . . . . at least for me.', 'The product works amazingly well. I have a fan that runs behind me all the time. I hit noise cancellation and the sound disappears. The only complaint I have is that they keep dropping off my iPhone and my work PC: if you leave any program on the PC without sound they drop offline which is irritating and downright terrible if it happens during a Zoom Call.. I have a smart watch and it seems that is interfering with the Air Pods and causing my iPhone drop offs I proved that by removing my smart watch and leaving it in another room and no drop offs occured in 3 hours. Where prior to that they would drop off every 10-15 mins.', \"I'm an audiophile, and am picky speakers and headphones. I bought these mostly for the convenience of bluetooth and to replace my much larger over-the-ear noise-cancelling headphones when flying. My expectations for audio quality weren't high because of bluetooth limitations, but these sound fantastic. It's hard to beat the combination of active and passive noise cancellation, and spacial audio is icing on the cake. Movies that support Dolby Atmos place the center channel where the phone is, so turning your head or walking away tricks your brain into thinking dialog is coming from your phone. The charging case is another great feature. No complaints. A++\", 'I tried to go the \"cheap\" route and not splurge on Airpods..  However, after trying Samsung Galaxy Buds and Amazon Echo Buds, I was left disappointed.  I returned both of them and went with the AirPod Pro\\'s.  Yes they are 100+ more but you definitely get what you pay for. Noise cancellation is great, (Not as great as with the Echo Buds, but still pretty darn good) They fit perfectly in my ears and are pretty small too.  Echo Buds made me look like Frankenstein and they hurt my ears after a while.  Galaxy Buds have a nice fit. Sound quality is really good too.  I think it can still be improved upon but they sound much better than the Samsung Buds and the Echo Buds. The charging case supports wireless charging.  It\\'s also really small which is more than I can say about the Echo Buds case... ugh that thing is ginormous.  However, Samsung has the smallest case out of any of these. Pairing was easy and I didn\\'t have any issues.  I even have a Galaxy S10+ and haven\\'t had any issues.  I had connection problems with the Echo Buds and Alexa didn\\'t always hear me when I said the \"wake\" work. Overall I\\'m extremely satisfied with the AirPod Pro\\'s.  I do think they are overpriced by about 50 dollars but I don\\'t have any gripes or complaints about them like I did with the others, so I\\'m happy.  :)', 'I definitely expected a lot more reading all the reviews. This was honestly my first “wireless” earbuds. The sound quality is only decent. Sound like a decent inexpensive pair of earbuds at best. The noise isolation works surprisingly well though, drowning out most external noise and voices.  The integration with apple iOS is almost seamless which is really nice, no complicated menu opening setup, have them charged and near the device and they pair automatically. However even in that category there are some shortcomings. Sometimes pressing the button to continue music will start playing my apple music media rather than the streaming service i was just listening to. Sometimes the music stops playing all together despite the buds still having juice. So there’s that, but hey theoretically that can all be fixed with updates. But what cant be fixed with an update is the battery life and ergonomics. The battery seems to last 2 hours with noise cancellation. Honestly the buds sound like trash without noise isolation on. Sure you can charge them in the battery dock but that means you aren’t listening to them, but hey I guess its in line with all the competition. I just wish they sounded better with noise isolation off because the battery lasts quite a bit more in that mode. The ergonomics suck, I know everyone has different ears but I figured with interchangeable tips I would find a good fit. Nope, these are awkward and painful in my ears. After the pain and discomfort faded after wearing them everyday for 2 weeks, they still fit awkwardly and fall out way too easily. I thought the joy of wireless earbuds was not having to take them off when you take a sweater/jacket off or when you remove a bag from your shoulder, but you still have to take these out unless you want them to fly out when the stems catch on something. Its funny they advertise the water resistance with pictures of people running….they fell out several times when i tried running. At least they are decently durable, several falls and they still work fine, although they are scratched up pretty good. I will most likely not be buying another pair of these buds when they inevitably die. Another minus is these things are impossible to repair. Some might say all these types of earbuds are like that…but remember Apple established these industry standards. So I have no problem holding that against these Overall the apple ecosystem really is a nice ecosystem as long as to stick to apple products. These buds are a nice addition if you are committed to apple products. But some more honest, impartial reviews are needed. These are simply not as great as so many say they are. Im sure Apple will dramatically refine this product in the coming years though', 'Apple hit a triple on these.  No comparison between the Pros and AirPods in sound quality.  After listening to the Pros its is hard to use the AirPods. Noise cancellation is good, but not great.  If you are looking for great noise cancellation - subway, air travel, etc. - these are not it and for basically the same price you can get the top-of-the-line Sony or Bose wireless headphones.  However, if your seeking something that sounds very good, offers decent cancellation, is very portable and easy to use then the Pros are for you. Bass and mid-range is vastly improved from the AirPods.  The fit tool works very well - I trusted it and switched back to the the medium plug from small in my right ear (could not run or walk using my AirPods, right ear is problematic with most brands of earbuds) and it worked perfectly during my run.  These are made for the gym, so nice to block out all the background noise.  Switching between cancellation and transparency modes gives you an idea of how much noise they block out.  Am I going to stop using my high-end headphones (wired/wireless) - no - but Apple has done a great job with their latest Pods.', \"I won't comment about anything regarding sound, because i did not use it. It smells terrible. You can get the smell even without unpacking. I tried it for a few minutes and repacked it. It smells terrible, feels like acetone, nail polish remover, glue, etc. The smell is so intense. I find it hard to believe that there are no reviews mentioning that. I even ordered a second product from Apple Store itself, thinking I got some bad product. But the second product had the same smell. I checked Apple forums and Reddit, it looks like some products smell like blueberries and some products smell like what I got. Those that smell terrible will smell the same way even after two weeks according to the posts I checked. Nevertheless, returning both and never buying it again.\", 'Having just upgraded from the AirPods 1, I’m blown away. The noise cancellation and transparency mode options are the biggest deal. I put these on just as my professor ended class and everyone started getting up and making a giant ruckus. It was like the room went nearly silent. They’re also significantly more comfortable than the AirPods. I can wear these for hours and not feel any discomfort. I could be wrong but they seem like they take a little longer than the originals to charge, but it’s not bad at all. I was worried about the size of the case but the increase in size isn’t noticeable in my pocket. Highly recommend these.', \"These things are great when they're working but that's only part of the time. Sometimes they just crap out and you need to get them replaced. I've had this happen twice. Apple's quality control has been going down hill ever since Tim Cook took over and it's hurt every aspect of the company. It's really disappointing because I used to trust Apple and now I don't. This may be a personal issue with me but the damn things keep falling out of my ears too This never happened with the standard Airpods. It doesn't matter what size pads I put in, it keeps happening. Overall I'm extremely disappointed in these. If they keep screwing up I'm going to just bite the bullet and buy the Sony ones. Apple products have lost the quality that made the worth the premium price. I have a 27 inch iMac and I'm planning on building a PC to replace it when it goes. I'm done with Apple. They're not the company they used to be.\", 'The sound quality is what I expected from an Apple product. I should have upgraded my regalar AirPods to these a long time ago! I kind of wish I had upgraded them. It is definitely a game changer. With the noise isolation, it completely removes background noise. It is like MAGIC!! At the same time, if you turn on the \"Transparency Mode\" you can hear everything clear as day around you as if you didn\\'t have the headphones in -- add in a little music and it is a great setting for when you want to listen to some music while working, but still need to pay attention to whatever is. going on around you. But the moment you want to isolate yourself and block everything and/or everyone around you, turn Isolation mode on. Note that I don\\'t call it noise cancellation, because it is more than that --- it is like turning off the world around you. You don\\'t even have to have music or any sound on to turn this feature on. Easily go from your Mac to your iPhone and even your AppleTV or AppleWatch without having to pair it to every device. Also, the force touch on the stems of the headphones help you toggle between isolation and transparency. Additional controls are there and standard: 1 click on either stem to play/pause, 2 to skip a song, 3 clicks to start the song over and/or go to the previous song. Don\\'t worry about having to press anything to activate Siri -- just invoke Siri by saying \"Hey, Siri\". If you want additional hands free features, you can select to have Siri read your messages when they arrive without having to do anything (you only have the option to set this up when you first set up the AirPods -- you can turn this on from the Notifications Setting on your iPhone at a later time). If you are working from home and need to be able to create a solid work environment without having a door to close behind you, this is a must buy!! Again, not sure why I didn\\'t get them sooner!!!', \"Extremely disappointed and frustrated to receive an open-box item for this full-price supposedly new item listing. Almost fraudulent, and this is not even the first time I'm receiving a deceitful item. Dishonest and deceptive. I'm filing a return, but I might've taken this if I didn't know that Apple always plastic wraps its products.\", 'I decided to upgrade to these once I was finally able to get them after a month of delay they came within the next day once they were shipped. I had the AirPods one and they were great and I had no complaints sound was pretty neutral. I will see these do you have better sound but I’ve had a few problems where when I’m bent over working the pods or fall out I never had that with the others that’s the only really negative affect I’ve had with it. The transparency mode is OK it’sJust like having regular headphones and I don’t notice too much of a difference with transparency and having it off, but the noise canceling you can feel kind a suction when you have no sound on and it definitely works well not as good as the beats studios I have but for in here I think they’re one of the best I’ve had. I definitely recommend going into your settings music in the go to the EQ and playing with that until you find a sound that you like the most I got a lot better bass and sound quality when I change the EQ.', \"I've owned the regular airpods for several years now and use them all day everyday, however as of lately my shop has gotten louder and louder and I decided to buy these with hopes I wouldn't have to keep the volume as loud. The noise cancelling is truly amazing for their size. They sound great. Do to the silicone tips the bass is slightly better then the regular airpods. The added ability to skip forward and back on tracks on this model over the regular model is nice too. Overall I'm very happy with them.\", 'I ordered these for my granddaughter. She raves about them .I know that they work very well because when she is sitting next to me in the car and I am talking to her the noise cancellation works so well that my granddaughter can no longer hear me. LOL I will be going on and on about life’s important lessons and the Apple EarPods work so well that she never hears me even a little bit. Lol I tried them out one time and I was amazed how different the sound was Then the cheaper ones that I had gotten before. I know they are pricey , but according to what I can figure out and what my granddaughter says they are well worth every penny.', \"I bought it when Amazon was having a deal on it. Only to find out, the same deal can be found on Costco. I was a little disappointed as I had troubles with it in the beginning. The noise canceling gave me a headache, sometimes it wouldn't connect with FaceTime video. Even to this day, I can't really chat with my friend because they say they can't hear my voice. I can hear them well but they can't hear me speak. I think my friend has the same problem with their AirPods as well. For the price, I'm not sure if it's worth it. What's the point if people can't hear me during phone calls? I do like that I can track my AirPods if they are misplaced but other than that, I think it's more of a hyped thing more than anything.\", 'I will preface with the statement that I don’t have specific indicators that my issues are related to this product being sold through Amazon, but it’s my theory... I have had these AirPods for 3 months now. I had the first gen prior to these and needed new ones due to my first gen just getting old and worn out. My issue with these is the totally inconsistent charging. I will have the pods in the case on a charger for hours and I go to use them and only 1 is fully charged and the other is dead, even if it wasn’t dead when I put it in the charger... or sometimes a fully charged pod won’t register when it’s in my ear and connect to my phone. I have several minor frustrations that build into me really disliking this purchase. I still give a 3 star rating because when they do work properly, it is good sound quality and I enjoy the noise cancellation. My recommendation would be to skip purchasing through Amazon and go straight through Apple, just in case.', 'After 2-3 weeks of usage there is a slight crackling sound the accompanies bass. Once you notice it , you hear it all the time. Also, the serial number on the box shipped by Amazon does not fully match the serial number listed in your order. Which makes me wonder...  I bought 3 pairs, in 3 separate orders, and all have same sound and serial number issues.', 'I received my package a day and ear buds were easy to install. Wasn’t sure if these would work with my iPhone 6s and worked perfectly. Personally, the music sounds amazing, crisp, and clear. The noise cancellation is virtually incredible. The transparent feature was quite impressive when switching between the two features. You have to go into the Bluetooth setting to make these changes. If I could be picky for a moment, the cable included couldn’t be used, so I had to use one of my extra cables. Last, if there was an app for the equalizer control, that would be epic, but the internal auto feature was fine as I enjoy music yet not a professional. After further review, the charge was not great on this unit. Sometimes it didn’t recognize the device in the ear. Think I’ll stick to my mpow', \"These AirPods are certainly real! You can verify the serial number on the Apple website. Unfortunately I don't really like them. The transparency setting is interesting- it changes the quality of the sound (kindof makes it very bright and sharp) and lets in a lot of noise which can be overstimulating. The noise cancelling feature works pretty well. The sound quality is good too. However, they do not stay in my ears well. They fall out frequently even though I have the Medium sized ear piece on. They also do not connect to my Windows PC, which has been a source of frustration. I have tried pairing and unpairing, forgetting the device, turning Bluetooth off of all of my other devices so only my Laptop is available to connect, but the AirPods still will not stay connected or show up as an output device in the audio settings. No one has been able to help me fix this issue. Unless you really want the noise cancelling feature, the regular AirPods are probably fine.\", 'I have had 3 pairs of AirPods and I purchased these for running season this year. I only used them a week before I returned them. 1. They kept falling out/slipping out of my ears. I would constantly have to push them/ re adjust them in my ear and then over time, I would feel them slipping again. it became annoying. I even tried to change the ear tip and still had problems. The different ear tip size wouldn’t have a good seal when It was tested. 2. The active noise cancellation was not that fantastic. I would turn it on in loud areas and still seem to have to turn the music up to drown out the sound. 3. I hated having to use 2 fingers to pinch in order to  skip/ pause/ play/ and activate/deactivate noise cancellation. I much prefer the taps on the regular AirPods to these pinches on the pro. I am one to love his gadgets and the new thing, but this honestly was not for me. Hopefully this will help with others.', \"Was excited to upgrade from my Airpods 2 to these, but after a week of trying them out I decided to return them. They do look cooler, and they sound a little better, but I just could not get comfortable with them in my ears. The original Airpods can sit in my ears all day and I barely notice them. Even with the smallest eartips in, these still had my ears aching after about an hour. It's a shame, because the noise cancelling is a nice addition, and they do look pretty sleek. To me, I'd rather just stick with the originals. Ironically enough however, my wife has smaller ears than me and she prefers these over the originals. So who knows, maybe just my personal experience.\", 'I love how these earbuds work seamlessly with my iPhone.  Open the charging lid.  Shows the battery status of both the buds and the case.  Instantly connects to Bluetooth with no muss or fuss.  Sound is great.  BUT - maybe I got a dud because I do not sense any \"noise canceling\" features.  Yes, I have it set to that (you can toggle between different settings.)  Even with music playing, I can hear all of my surroundings.  In fact, I don\\'t notice much difference when I toggle between the different settings.  I also own the earlier generation non-\"pro\" version which do not profess to be \"noise canceling\" and I don\\'t notice any difference in noise canceling between the two.  Either I\\'m doing something wrong or got a defective pair.  Or maybe my expectations are too high!', 'I use my AirPod 2’s at work quite often and usually after about 20 min or so my ears will get agitated and I have to adjust them. With the pros it has a better shape for my ear and less hassle to worry about them falling out. The different size tips are very useful to find what fits best for your ear unlike the one size fits all AirPods.  The noice cancellation really works! I tested it out with conversation and outside noise and I could not hear a thing but what I was listening to.  The battery life is good, I am able to wear them for majority of an 8 hour work day and still have plenty of charge left between the ear buds and the case.  The charging case fully charged within 15-20 min (plugged in) I do not have a wireless charger. I used to think the pros were not worth the upgrade but I was wrong, if you are able to find a sale for these on Amazon or maybe Black Friday I would cop some.', \"The first set I received was defective and didn't pair with any of my 4 devices.  But Amazon replaced it right away and the new Airpoids Pro work great! I have tiny ear canals so these are a bit big bit there are different size silicone pads that come with it and it helps a bit.  But I have't tried working out with them yet so I'm anxious to see how they do running or weight training.  The sound and the noise cancelation are amazing.  I got these since my new Macbook pro doesn't have any headphone jacks and I needed something to use for school/work conferences that was reliable and had a good battery life (not like the generic earbuds). I have not used these long enough to really test the battery, however, but from what others have experienced, it lasts a majority of the day when using periodically.  I also got the wireless charging case. to be able to use just one pod  while charging the other charges, if needed, during my school/work days.\", \"Good sound (I'm not an audiophile), first time using noise cancelation for me seems magical. Easy setup and great iPhone integration and features of course. Phone calls are great and the microphones are fantastic. Good fit after fiddling with ear tips, though no wing tips and a shallow in ear fit can make them fall out in some situations, though that seems to be happening less often as I use them more. Uses the same cord as iPhone, though I wish they both had USB C instead of lightning. Battery is great though and the case is perfectly sized for the little pocket in jeans.\", \"I've only used these paired with an iPhone, so I can only speak to that experience.  I was amazed at how easy these were to pair with the phone.  I've spent a lot of time over the years trying to pair headsets and speakers with devices, and it's almost always a major pain.  These AirPod Pros and the iPhone pair as if they were just meant to be together.  *I know they should, but after trying to pair other devices that should have been meant to pair with the company's flagship phones, they rarely ever pair easily. The sound on these is amazing!  The noise canceling feature is not the greatest, but these are also earbuds and not over the ear headphones, so expectations were realistic.  The sound quality for music and voice are excellent, and they are quite comfortable for earbuds as well.\", 'Once the spatial audio was introduced in September 2020, AirPod Pro now stands out from all headphones, period. Only problem is that Apple locks this new feature to its own ecosystem. The feature is for the newer iPhones and iPads only. Even with them, the feature is not available to Amazon, Netflix, Spotify apps yet. The auto switch feature is a little bit confusing and not working always. I don’t care for it anyway. The transparency feature is really nice so that I don’t have to take them off to hear a conversation. The noise cancellation is pretty good, although Bose is the king; however, for the convenience and these new features, I have totally switched to AirPod Pro now. [Added] The noise cancellation works without having to connect to a device. So you can use it as earplugs. The battery lasts reasonably. Some of my friends complained about being difficult to wear, but it’s rather a personal choice I think.  I don’t find them easy to fall out either, but they still do. Just be careful, that’s it.  I love them. Not an Apple fanboy here BTW.', 'Granted, I don’t have any other noise canceling headphones to compare these to, so take this how you will, but I was not expecting to like these as much as I do, especially for the price. But I do! I love these! Especially for traveling. Airports and airplanes become so much more pleasant with these noise-canceling little beauties in your ears! True wireless is also amazing! I honestly can’t stand talking on the phone without these anymore. The sound quality is really good too. When I’m watching something, I’ll often find myself looking around to see if the sound was coming from the show or real life. For anyone with an iPhone looking for some wireless headphones, I would absolutely recommend these! No question.', 'Tested on music and the sound is perfect Tested on surround movie and the sound is better than the original movie though high end speakers. The noise cancellation tech is fantastic if the noise is constant.  Like a pool pump or a washing machine. The ability to hear someone taking to you while listening to music, works, but quickly looses it as higher volumes. The example is that you could not use these as hearing aids. All is forgiven because the music is so clear to life. The fit of the ear buds is tolerable, you will know they are there; but be able to forgive it because they sound, great. The phone mic is very clear. All in all, these are some of the best headphone devices ever made.', 'I’ve been troubleshooting for over an hour and cannot get the dang things to connect. They were on the charger all night - Fresh out of the plastic. This has completely killed my work flow and I am already behind on deadlines. Seriously an unreliable piece of equipment... Off to try all of the apple troubleshooting directions AGAIN. :( **Update: I spent another afternoon troubleshooting them to see if I can get them to connect after a full night on the charger. Nope. Nada. Zilch. I’m so frustrated. I was hoping they’d work so I didn’t have to return them but it looks like I’m going to have to make time to go to UPS to return the da*n things.', \"I already owned the previous generation AirPods, which I just love.  Quite the game changer.  My only complaint with those, really, was that in some situations, like lifting weights, they weren't as secure in my ears as I would like.  Also, I couldn't do things like mow the lawn while listening to music with them because they don't really try to block outside noise.  So I was really looking forward to these new ones to solve those problems.  Boy, do they, and how.  Not only are they perfectly snug and form a nice seal in my ears, the noise cancellation, but ability to easily switch to transparent mode, is just amazing - far beyond what I expected.  Then on top of all of that, my music just sounds incredible.  I'm a bit hard-of-hearing with some good tinnitus, so I don't have really high expectations when it comes to playback quality, but I'm just blown away by how good music sounds with these.  I'm hearing little things in my music that I've never heard before.  Another game changer here.  Highly recommended.\", \"I am enjoying using this product. The sound quality is good enough.  I listen to music and Podcasts and don't notice any difference between it and the old Apple headphones I had.I really like the hands free aspect. The battery life seems to be pretty long the charging packages good. It was a little tricky  To pair the ear phones to my smartphone but it did work eventually and hasn't had any problems with That since then.  Don't get frustrated keep trying.  The 1st set of headphones  had a problem, one of the headphones would overheat and feel hot on my ear.  I returned them to the vendor and they promptly replaced them with a good pair. Since the  Product is somewhat new I would excuse that but definitely send them back in if you have this problem it's worth it to get a new pair that works. It's nice to know that they stand behind their product. Really the cost Is worth it.\", \"To start, these were originally purchased for my wife. Unfortunately, she has remarkably small ear canals - her primary care physician has remarked that they are too small for the otoscope - and none of the included tips will fit her.  Her loss is my gain. They fit in my ears quite securely, even through rigorous activities such as yard work and running. The noise cancellation is honestly much better than I anticipated, and the overall sound quality is a definite upgrade from the standard Airpods. The only con I've found so far is pairing them with a Windows 10 pc. Windows treats these as a hands-free device by default, which renders the audio into absolute trash. Working around this is more of a hassle than I'm interested in pursuing when I have other high-quality options at my disposal anyway. Overall, another well-designed Apple product that works seamlessly with my existing products (iPhone, Macbook, Watch) and a satisfactory buying experience through Amazon.\", 'I was a former Bose free wireless guy, so anyone who’s ever used them knows they protrude out of the ear, which means they Are prone to being dislodged. The AirPods pros are sleek and lightweight.  I still find myself having to readjust them and they have fallen out but not as much as the Bose. Pros: Sleek in ear and the case has a small footprint. Siri reads my text to me and I can respond via speech to text. The translucent feature is pretty cool, allow you to hear background noise, which I prefer when in public. Noise canceling is legit. Completely locks out sound, which I don’t like in public. Auto pulse when removed from the ear. Cons: Does not announce the callers name or number for incoming calls.  Bose free wireless did. AirPods forces you to blindly answer or pull out your phone or smart watch. Auto switch: they don’t always seamlessly switch from car audio to AirPods. Can’t adjust volume from AirPods, unless I just can’t figure it out.', 'I like their fit and finish, but their functioning is good, not great.  I do like their wireless freedom over my wired Bose noise cancelling—I always found the wires annoying, especially when walking/jogging outside.  These give a real sense of freedom and they stay in my ear.  They fit my inner ear fine, but after 2 h, I am ready for a break—just me perhaps.  The quality of the sound isn’t that bright and the lows seem muddy at times.  Yet, I can enjoy music untethered.  PodCasts come across wonderfully.  I do like the noise cancelling; they tend to mute droning background sounds the clothes dryer and soften the world of sound a bit.  When I had an update to my iPhone they were a bit “goofy” until the next update—but that was Apple working it’s “magic.”  All in all, I would purchase them again.', \"I absolutely loved my old airpods... so, why wouldn't I give the new ones a chance?  I gave my old airpods to my niece, and I'm thinking about stealing that candy back from the baby.  The new airpods are terrible.  They randomly connect, even when in the case.  I'll take them out of the fully-charged case, and low-and-behold the damn things didn't charge... nothing obstructing the airpods in the case.  Sometimes they are fully-charged, I take them out... and they do not connect.  Sometimes they pop up on the screen, indicating they are connected, but fail to connect.  Gotta turn everything off and on.  Do you think Apple backs up their product?  Hell no, they are only interested in producing more plastic for the ocean.  Why make the Ipad keyboard functional when we sell a $300 piece of crap, non-recyclable keyboard?  Sadly, patent laws and the corporate-government relationship will hinder any future developers from having a chance at producing a better future.\", 'I have so many online work meetings doing work from home and use these AirPods Pro\\'s consistently all day long connected to my workstation and sometimes phone. I don\\'t mind switching between Bluetooth connections, as that\\'s not that difficult )unless my wife walks in and it for some reason syncs to her iPhone). 1. The noise cancelling is incredible. It really helps focus on the call at hand, drowns out the kids playing on the xbox, etc. 2. The wireless charging ability is a huge plus. I bought a dual charger and can charge my phone and AirPods at the same time overnight while I sleep and have them fresh for the day\\'s work. 3. Problematic is that due to safety concerns, they limit the volume capability so to not be responsible for any potential \"too loud\" hearing loss. Which is sad because not everyone hears at the same volume. I can live with that. 4. The real disappointment comes in with the battery life. With any other headset (JBL,Jabra) it seemed as if I could run a full 8 hours of work with no problem or charging needed. With AirPod Pro\\'s, I can only go half a shift, maybe slightly a little longer if I don\\'t use Noise Cancelling, which is not a sacrifice you want to have to make. Overall, these AirPod Pro\\'s are good, but they could be really exceptional if they fixed these few items regarding volume control and battery life. I\\'m not sure if they\\'re actually worth the cost. You may want to try one of the less expensive knock offs first and see if those satisfy your need for a big amount of savings.', \"I like Apple's products and will keep these in the hopes that a firmware update will fix the issue, but, as others have experienced, the first time I used these with the ANC activated I ended up with a bad headache and feeling very dizzy; I almost threw up and didn't feel right again for 24 hours. That said, the ANC is really good; noises like air conditioning and other background noises disappear completely. But, until the seasickness issue is fixed (it's something with the way Apple has the frequencies programmed to cancel each other out), for me they're just an expensive set of normal wireless ear buds and not worth the premium price.\", 'The sound quality is perfect if you’re not an audiophile! The noise cancellation is more of a noise minimization which isn’t a bad thing seeing how small and useful these things are. The cancellation works best with background noise better than it would with someone next to you talking to you or something falling and hitting the floor near you. The transparency is great and such a useful feature but if you have your music loud enough you might as well turn it off, you also don’t get crystal clear transparency but for the size and convenience of these it’s understandable and actually kind of impressive that it’s as good as it is, it’s just not as clear or refined as other over the ear headphones that do it better. They’re great so far and I love having them but I have had some glitches with them that didn’t last more than a day so luckily that didn’t ruin the product for me and never happened again. These are also pretty durable, if you aren’t being reckless with them they last you a while and will stay in pretty good shape, I’ve dropped them a few times and on the worst of those they were only scratched a bit, lucky it isn’t noticeable and doesn’t effect my listening at all. Something to note would be if you haven’t used true wireless earbuds before these might make your ears hurt a bit but that’s only because you aren’t used to holding these things up in your ear and it’ll stop bothering you in a week or two which at the time annoyed me but now that I’m used to them I love using them, and for people with waxy ears these might be a bit tedious for you while people that have super waxy ears I would suggest thinking twice about getting these because AirPods falling out of your ears constantly might ruin the convenience they offer. But the thing about AirPods Pro that makes them so great is all the little problems they fix when compared to other earbuds/headphones. They may be pricey but for the convenience, quality and experience that comes with apple products I definitely think these were a worthwhile purchase. (They’re also somewhat stylish and not much people own them which is a small bonus!)', \"I bought these for a 9 year old because normal Airpods won't fit in her ear canal. These work great. She uses her Airpods Pros with an iPhone SE 2020 and everything works fantastic. Noise cancellation is absolutely noticeable when it kicks on. Sound great and batteries last for about 6 hours of continuous listening. The case lasts about a week before it needs a charge. Included charging cable is USB-C to Lightning Cable, so be sure to have USB-C port on your PC or power brick. My MSi X570 motherboard had one included on the rear ports. Works and charges fine.\", 'The AirPods Pro are great in many ways , fits its niche perfectly but falls short in many ways . It’s all dependent on what you want and what you expect . The big problem from the start is sound quality. If you love top notch audio especially when balanced between mid and lows with a heavy bass line they simply can’t perform . Highs are ok but that even suffers with noise cancelation . On a plus note , podcasts , audiobooks and news sound very good over long listening times . If sound is your top priority I would go with the Sony noise canceling option . If you can overlook the sound quality then AirPods really are great , seamless with changing between Apple devices , very comfortable and easier to transport . The control options and integration between your phone is a wonderful experience. The only reason I kept them is because for spoken word and podcasts they are great and I can’t keep my Sony XM-0003 on all the time due to it being over the ear . But sound doesn’t compare between the two and you could spend a quarter of the price and have much better sound options but not the convenience.', 'Great sound, it is wicked crazy how when turning on the noise cancellation, it really stops 90-95% of all surrounding sounds. It is almost relaxing to just use the noise cancelling when you need some silence and not even playing anything. Regarding the \"seal sound test\" or whatever it is called, I feel it is not really giving adequate results, but that may also be more of an iPhone software issue and not particularly of the Airpods themselves. The test resulted in basically telling me every included size was \"GOOD\" even though some of the sizes felt like they were slipping out of my ear and physically fit test wise, were not the ideal size earbud size. So far, I am very impressed. Honestly is a LOT more money I would want to pay for something like this, but so long as the quality is good and it lasts for years and years to come, I will deal with it. I don\\'t see myself ever spending any more than I did on these though for any new Airpod products in the future. $250 is more than enough to spend on wireless earbuds. But that is Apple for you.', \"I had a pair of AirPods 2nd gen for 2 yrs and loved them, but everyone said they could hear everything I was doing when they talked to me.  Not good and I was always unhappy with that feature.  I received this pair a month ago and have been very happy.  No one can hear what I am doing in the background and I can hear everyone clearly as well.  Also, I love to listen to books and watch TV while my husband works so it doesn't disturb him.  AirPods Pro has been exactly what I needed to enjoy a set of earbuds completely.  They come with 3 sets of ear tips for different sized inner ear canals.  I have a small canal and the small tips work great for my ears and don't fall out.  I recommend AirPods Pro and would purchase again for future needs.\", \"These sounds ok. Other equally priced earbuds have much better sound for the price. The noise cancellation is fantastic. I have several other noise cancelling headphones and these beat the Bose, Beats and JBL in that department. The sound pass-through feature is super cool. I didn't think I would use it but it has become the main reason I like theses. Battery life is really bad. It lasts maybe 4 hours of play when using the noise cancelling or pass-through features. I haven't tested the life with these turned off. I'm sure that would significantly extend the life.\", \"During the initial use, the Airpod worked fine with my Razer 2 phone. It did what was necessary for terms of audio and handling mic use for phone calls. I enjoyed the longevity of the battery life and how I could limit the outside noise. Unfortunately, that was short-lived. After not even a year of having the Airpods Pro, one of the Airpods started doing a rattling sound when audio was played. It's become so apparent that it's rendered that single Airpod useless and I avoid it. For this price, I anticipated a longer life of the product and I'm genuinely upset how the return window closed and there's seemingly no remedy for the rattling sound. I would definitely evaluate this purchase since personally, I find it unacceptable that for around $200, this remains the standard in terms of quality. If I had the option, I would consider a cheaper option that has a better build quality.\", 'This version of AirPods has been great for me. The devices charge up fairly quickly. The battery life has been good with continuous music or podcasts during workouts. The special transparency mode helps to both provide sound, but allow background noise for safety awareness. My four stars are due to the somewhat weak inner ear grip. Although I can perform a low intensity workout (e.g. weightlifting, yoga, etc.) with no issues, it may come loose when jogging or running. I bought a cheap plastic hook that keeps it from falling out of my ear, but prevents the charging case from completely closing. Overall, it is a very good product. While not perfect, it is a quality Apple brand ear bud which can play great sound for non-intense activities.', 'Well for the price point. I was expecting a whole lot more. To me $250 is not a lot for a great pair of headphones. However I lost my $40 pair that I absolutely loved from a brand I can’t remember that I got on here. I got these hoping that I’ll be blown away and not want anything else. I simply did not happen. The sound quality is that of any other headphone I’ve ever had. So why pay so much more. All the features this does is absolutely amazing. Paired easily there was no White noise entering. However my $30 ones did the exact same thing. The only thing I did not do of course with all the Apple functions. I didn’t mind losing my $40 pair I think I would mind a lot if I lost these knowing that they were so expensive and they didn’t even sound better than my $40 pair. I understand why a lot of people will want these it’s simply not me. Really think about it. You can get just as good sounding earbuds from a lot of other companies. I sent these back. And don’t regret it at this point.I just picked up a $30 pair which I’m sure I’ll love.', \"I had recently purchased an iPhone 11 and found these iPod Pro headphones on sale for $50 off the regular price of $250. I was being relocated back to an office environment and was looking for something to kill the background noise (aka co-workers on video calls who used their outside voices when talking). Pros: Works well with iPhone, has really good sound, charging case was a delightful surprise. Cons: Can't wear them for more than an hour, ears hurt too much. Doesn't actually block outside noises, just blocks low-level ambient sounds. iPods need to be recharged via case at least twice a day at work. I would not have purchased this item if I had heeded the other reviews for the iPod Pro ear buds regarding ear discomfort and ineffective noise-cancelling. I had to burn myself on the stove instead of listening to the other reviewers.\", 'I did a lot of research before I bought these on Amazon Prime Day and they did not disappoint! I typically don’t like in-the-ear headphones because they don’t stay in my ears well. However, these came with multiple ear bud sizes and they stay in well, even while running and sweating. Another great feature is that you can adjust the setting so you can hear background noise (eg need to be able to hear surroundings on a trail) or to noise cancelling. The sound quality is great for music or audio books. The case keeps a charge for a long time- almost 2 weeks since I’ve charged it with consistent use. I’m very happy with my purchase.', 'I have an over ear Sony headset that cost about as much as these did and I like these better and the noise cancellation in these little things is insane! I love apple products anyway so I’m a little biased but headphones/earphones are important to me as I need to be able to focus with the noise cancellation since I live on Main St and not alone as well as the sound quality. I use these for everything, phone calls would be terrible without them. I wish I could have ten more pairs honestly. I wish everyone could experience these.', \"Instead of writing three separate reviews, I have decided to write one roundup comparing the three earbuds below: Apple AirPods Pro Sony WF-SP800N Samsung Galaxy Buds+ First of all, I’m not an audiophile, just an ordinary everyday user. So, as long as the audio quality is decent, I won't complaint about it. I’m sorry about my long review. If you’re only interested in one of these 3 products, feel free to jump to the section you’re interested in. Apple AirPods Pro: My first true wireless earphones is Apple’s AirPods Pro. I never consider the original Airpods because of the lack of silicone ear tips. Once the AirPods Pro was available, I jumped onto the true wireless earphones wagon. It works extremely well with my iPhone as expected. The noise canceling feature works pretty well and it’s convenient when I go on flights. The charging case is very small. I don’t have many complaints about the product except for three minor ones: (1) it’s expensive just like other Apple products, (2) it’s not available in more subtle colors, like black and, (3) sometimes, when I put my AirPods back to its case, the music app on my iPhone would suddenly and randomly play a song (not from my music library) from the phone speakers. I think it’s a bug. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this product. If you don’t mind its price and you have an iPhone, this is definitely the true wireless earphones you should get. Sony WF-SP800N: Later on, I started searching for a secondary wireless earphones to share the “workload” of my AirPods. My first choice was Sony WF-SP800N. I picked it because: (1) I was a Sony fan (before becoming an Apple fan). Back in the late 80’s/early 90’s, I even bought those super slim cassette tape Walkmans/Discmans from Japan, which were not available in the US. Later on, I also bought MD Walkmans. (2) It works with Sony’s Headphones Connect app, which allows you to customize the earphones to your needs (WF-XB700 doesn’t support the app). (3) It offers active noise canceling feature but not as expensive as the high-end WF-1000XM3. Active noise canceling is not a must-have feature for me, but because of how good it works in AirPods Pro, it’s now a nice-to-have feature. (4) It’s competitively priced. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. (1) I don’t know why, but no matter which size of ear tips I picked, the earphones just don’t fit well. It’s probably because the outer portion of the earphones is too big. No matter how I push the earphones into my ears, they just won’t stay in. Without a good fitting, it affects the audio quality. It also takes me 5-7 seconds to put on each earbud because I keep second guessing whether it’s at the “optimal” position. (2) The noise canceling feature hardly reduces any noise. I kept turning on and off the feature to compare. I can tell it’s doing something (the noise changed) but it’s not reducing the noise. (3) The charging case is too big to put into my pant pocket. It makes the product inconvenient for everyday use. I’m sorry. I can’t recommend this product. If Sony US team is reading this review and if Sony Japan is designing all the products, please tell the Japan team that you don’t need to make too many half-baked products. You just need to offer 3 tiers of products (aka “good”, “better” and “best”) and focus on making sure they are the best products at their price points. If the noise canceling feature doesn’t work, then don’t put it there and make the pricing even more competitive. Furthermore, you have to make the earphones and the charging case smaller (for better fit and convenience, respectively.) You can learn a few things from Samsung (see review below.) Sony, I used to love your products. I hope I can buy quality and beautifully-designed products from you again. Please, please do better. Samsung Galaxy Buds+: Disappointed by the Sony earphones, I continued my search for secondary wireless earphones. Reading all the good reviews of Samsung Galaxy Buds+, I decided to give it a try. It turns out that the earphones are small and fit my ears perfectly. Since they fit so well, even though they don’t have active noise canceling feature, they block most of the background noise. They also look better than the AirPods Pro and they come in black! The battery life of these earphones is just amazing. The charging case is very small and I have no problem carrying it in my pant pocket. The Samsung Galaxy Buds app offers a few very welcoming customization features. I have two complaints though: (1) When I use this earphones in conference calls, people complain about my voice being extremely soft, almost inaudible. During phone calls, people also tell me my voice is not as clear as when I use Airpods Pro. Because of these reasons, I often need to switch back to Airpods Pro for calls. (2) The wireless range of this pair of Samsung earphones is not as good as the AirPods Pro. The audio starts breaking off when I’m about 20 feet away from my phone (with obstacles in between.) With the same distance, my AirPods Pro don’t have any range issue. However, I can tolerate that because this pair of Samsung earphones is much cheaper than AirPods Pro! In short, if you don’t feel like spending too much and your main use of wireless earphones is for listening to music, not phone calls, I would recommend this product.\", \"The airpod pros are good. The sound quality and battery life are around what I expected from this product. I was a bit surprised that the noise cancellation didn't do much as it mostly blocked out quieter sounds like somewhere around regular talking and a whisper but that's not a bad thing. Also, my airpods came with a small imperfection at the top which I think is a sign that the product is refurbished. Overall they aren't bad, the looks, audio quality, and battery life make up for the problems it has. I would still recommend this as a good option for people looking to buy a pair of wireless earbuds because they are on sale.\", \"First,  I've been using Amazon for 21 years (since '99! Wow!) and this is the first product I've ever given a negative review and the very first that I am returning. These things are terrible.  Seriously.  No really,  TERRIBLE! After a week,  the right ear piece stopped working.  It looked fully charged,  then seconds later it had 11%,  then jumped to 98%,  then to 13%, back and forth.  I left it in the case, thinking I needed to charge it again for whatever reason.  Next time I looked it was 100%,  still didn't work.  I tried lots of different things, nothing. Oh,  but the left ear piece DID work!  Well,  for another couple of days,  then it gave me the low power sound in the middle of my workout one morning,  I hadn't used them for 24 hours,  surely the charge in the case for 23 hours would be enough? Oh no...  that night I charged them up, and the next day I got the low power warning during the workout,  and this time they shut off.  Really. Oh hey,  but the right side had 100%,  oh but that's right,  that one doesn't work! Then I look at the percentage of the case...  it's dead.  It had charged all night the night before...  Now it's dead. Not.Even.Kidding. I am preparing my return package as I type this.  I don't want them to replace them,  I just want to get out of this AirPod PRO Hell. I will say something nice...  in the 3 times I was able to use them with both ears,  they were able to cancel out the noise around me.  So,  there's that. I had the original AirPods and gave them to my son (what was I thinking?),  they were way more reliable than this junk.  I am thoroughly disappointed in Apple.\", 'I bought them for the hearing aid feature and I saved thousands over standard aids. They work very well for me but may not for everyone. You can custom tune them for six frequencies which is adequate for me. Hearing aids can be customized for many more frequencies and may be necessary for some people. The hearing app test is not the best but will get you in the ballpark. I also have the standard AirPods and use them for general listening with my iPad. Because of my hearing loss I can’t tell the difference in the sound quality between the AirPods. If you have moderate hearing loss I would recommend giving them a try.', '', 'Noise canceling feature is pretty awesome.  AirPod pros are noticeably faster than first gen AirPods  when it comes to syncing them with your devices and going from one device to another.  Battery life is within the 5 hour range and has proven to be enough for my needs.  Sound quality seems to be the same with the AirPods with the only exception being when you have noise cancellation active. It sounds kind of weird when you turn off the noise cancellation feature and the air pods use the  external mic‘s  to pick up surrounding sounds.  Voices and things seem to have a “digital sound” to them.  Not as natural sounding as I’d expected.  In the future when these have worn out I will probably go back to the AirPods for the price.', 'Pros: -Sleek design and \"premium\" feel -Seamless connectivity with Apple products, and especially iPhones -Pressure controls are easy to use, and Siri can be summoned without touching the earbuds at all -Decent noise quality (though better can be found at significantly lower price points) -Ambient noise mode works well, and active noise cancelling works decently for a pair of in-ears -Let\\'s be honest, they\\'re AirPods; they make you look cool in front of your friends. Cons: -I tried all three sizes of ear tips and could not find a good fit; I constantly had to push the right AirPod back into my ear. This was the biggest deal-breaker for me. -Consequently, noise cancelling capability suffered; active noise cancelling is only as good as passive noise cancelling (the \"seal\" the earbuds create) allows it to be. -Active noise cancelling, when I turned it on, also noticeably removed some of the bass/low end from music I listened to. When I spend more than $200 on a pair of wireless earbuds, I expect a near-perfect experience, and I feel like I\\'m justified in that. My experience with the AirPods Pro was far from perfect. They\\'ve got a lot of cool bells and whistles, but ultimately they failed me in one of the areas that mattered most: no matter which size ear tips I tried, the darn things wouldn\\'t stay in my ears. It\\'s really annoying to constantly have to push an earbud back into your ear, especially while you\\'re trying to unload the dishwasher or do a cardio workout. And it\\'s definitely not something that anyone should be spending $200 for. Save your money. You can get a pair of wireless earbuds that stay in your ears better AND have better sound quality for a fraction of this price. I\\'ll point you in the direction of the FIIL T1X, a $50 pair of wireless earbuds that have the best sound quality of any I\\'ve tried (and I\\'ve also tried the Galaxy Buds +) and lodge in my ears like a dream. They don\\'t have all the cool bells and whistles and don\\'t feel as \"premium\" as the AirPods Pro, but they deliver in the areas that, in my opinion, really matter.', 'I tried several off brand or after market wireless earbuds. Kept chasing quality without having to pay the price for the Apple item. I should not have wasted my money. These are the real deal and they perform like it. Pair correctly every time. Sound fantastic. Several features that work easily. If you have an Apple product like my iPhone don’t waste your time and money with any other ear buds. I run and these have made my running so much more enjoyable.', 'Imagine a bustling airport with people talking loudly on their cell phone, kids crying and screaming, etc.  This distractible person who usually needs complete silence to work was able to work over 3 hours while waiting in an airport thanks to these babies. I turned on the noise cancellation function and some soft jazz, and then tuned out the world.  As you can imagine, it worked just as well for the airplane.  The sound quality on these is great too (as with the previous model) but the noise cancellation is gold. If you’re debating between the two models, get this one.', 'Very happy with these EarPods.  I have gone thru at least 6 pairs in the past 4 or 5 months.  But the key here is to invest in a good pair of Earbuds as it pays off in the long run.  Plus the bass is AWESOME!  I love bass and when you have lower priced earbuds the quality has no comparison to your more expensive ones!  I am sooo happy with my Apple AirPods Pro!  👏🙏👍. Plus the noise cancellation is fantastic!!!  Excellent choice', \"I strongly advise anyone interested in this product to avoid it and spare themself from wasting hundreds of dollars. The left-side AirPod does not hold its charge, and when it does charge it does so unevenly compared to the right-side AirPod. I have contacted Apple Customer Support and they have replaced both the charging case and the left-side AirPod, and that replacement pod also will not charge correctly (exact same issue). A quick review on the Apple Community Support board revealed that many others are having this same issue. So it would seem that this is a technical defect that Apple has not addressed. Steer clear! Warranty Update — I contacted Apple Customer Support about the left airpod's failure to hold a charge and they first replaced the charging case which did not fix the problem. Then they replaced the left airpod and that one charges fully and holds the charge like it's supposed to. Issue resolved.\", \"The sound quality was superb. I am attentive to the detail of sound, being able to hear distinct instruments and capturing the range of sounds. Most impressive. However, one earbud stopped working shortly after purchase. I received a replacement but that didn't work either. I contacted Apple who told me they would hold $308 to my account and replace the one defective earbud. I was very disappointed in Apple and switched to another brand. I am impressed with Amazon addressing the problems but not impressed with Apple guaranteeing their own product, even when it is new.\", 'So, the sound canceling is good, but if I’m going to want noise canceling, I want the big headphones that cancel all the noise. There’s never a time where I want just most of the noise canceled. But if you take it off noise canceling mode, it actually picks up sounds and makes you hear them better. I walked into Home Depot the other day with them on and I could hear every conversation going on around me. At the gym, I can hear the machines way louder than in real life. It’s just unnatural. Also, it can feel like your ears are popping. They do stay in better than the old ones- that’s the only pro.', \"First off, let me just address these airpod pros from a 30,000 foot view. Yes you can find earbuds that have better sound quality and noise cancelling, yes you can find earbuds that have a longer battery, yes you can find earbuds that are cheaper, but you will not find earbuds as complete as these are. These have the best combination of all of the above. Also, if you're like me and are concerned about not being able to hear yourself/sound like you're yelling when talking on the phone due to the noise cancelling feature and sealed off earbuds, don't worry because that is not an issue!! Transparency mode is incredible, I can hear myself perfectly as if I were using the regular apple headphones! Even on noise cancelling, I can still hear myself fairly well, though it's better to use Transparency mode for conversation. So, what about everything else? Sound is great! Again, you can find better sounding earbuds but you'll be missing other key features that these come with. Noise cancelling is amazing! It doesn't block out EVERYTHING, but you can hardly tell when you have music going. It's near impossible to get 100% noise cancellation but these get pretty close! I was concerned about the battery life but so far I have not had a problem. I think they actually last a little longer than what the box says. But regardless, I'm never on the phone for 5 hours straight anyway so that's not an issue. And they charge super fast. Connectivity is seamless, they are very portable, the charging case works great, and they are very comfortable to wear. I honestly can't find anything that I really don't like about these and I use them almost every day. Hands down one of my favorite Apple products.\", \"If I hadn't owned airpods before this review would be a 5. I was tempted to make it a 3. The noise cancellation and transparency mode are great. The sound quality is very good. Despite this, I most commonly carry my old airpods instead of these. The reasons are: (a) the case is smaller on the old airpods (it is more pocket friendly) and (b) the new piece fits well in the ear canal, but doesnt fit as well with my ear (the unique shape of the old airpods kept them in my ear even though they arent in your ear canal) If I really need great sound and noise cancellation, I will carry my Sony over the ear headphones. I keep my old airpods on my key chain for convienence. The new ones are just a bit big for that. If I am travelling or working somewhere public or noisy I will use my Sonys. Therefore, my airpod pros will likely sit in the drawer. Update: If you chew gum, it will pop them out of your ear. I did not have this problem with the originals.\", 'I received my airpods in August and they worked just fine but when going online to add insurance they had been previously registered. Their warranty had started months prior to my purchase. I retuned them. WELL amazon emailed me saying they received the incorrect item and that they were going to DISCARD what I sent. After emailing and calling many times an agent told me that I sent some “counterfeit” airpods. I explained to him that it can’t be because I saw their warranty online. He didn’t care to listen and said that I need to send them the original airpods. I don’t have nothing to send back so I asked him to send them back to me instead and he he said no can do. So yeah I payed for airpods but don’t own any. DON’T BUY FROM AMAZON. Buy them at the apple store or best buy. Even Costco!!!!!! Not worth the risk. They are toooo expensive for amazon to pull some BS like this.', 'I got them to see if there would be a difference between 1 gen and 2nd gen. Let me tell you that there is a huge difference. 1st the sound is pretty good in comparison. 2nd the noise cancellation is really good, 3rd I like how these stay in my ears compared to the other 2 generations. I am comparing them to the older generation as I have owned both. I head banged to Slayer to test them to see if they would stay in my ear and they did. I have only had them for a few hours and I am pleased with my purchase. I was skeptical in buying them, but I am glad I did. Within the last years I have purchased and returned the Jabra Elite 65t only because I could not get them to stay in my ear even with after market ear attachmeents. I also had and returned the Bose sound sport because of connectivity issues otherwise I would have kept those because the sound was phenomenal. Back to these AirPods Pro, its pretty cool to be able to listen to music and hear your surroundings.  I give this a 4 star rating overall. I hope this helps.', 'TL;DR The hype is real! These are awesome headphones and you should buy them. Oh man I love these. I work in a yard truck which is an EXTREMELY loud environment and these drown out so much sound! It’s truly impressive. With noise cancelation on by itself I barely hear anything, add music to the mix and all I hear is the music. The transparency mode is really awesome too! If I’m listening to music or a podcast and someone needs to talk to me, I simply pause and flip transparency mode on and am able to hold a conversation almost like the pods aren’t even in my ear. my only complaint is I wish apple would make an app or complication on the watch to control these a little better. Volume controls works fine on Apple Watch but switching modes (transparency/Noise Cancellation) is hit or miss; mostly miss. Still, that is a failure of the watch, not the headphones and the headphones have controls on them which seem to work fine.', 'At first I was upset because they came a day late and said to myself if the sound anything like my children airpods I was sending them back same day. Well to my surprise the sound blew me away .battery life is ok about 4 1/2 to 5 hours. But with the charging case he you last you most of the day and The noise canceling is unbelievable and nothing compares from what I’ve heard so far.When you turn on the noise cancellation on it sounds like you’re on the airplane and your ears need to be pop because the sound just disappears it’s incredible I could be in the car with my kids and they could be playing music I put my headphones on I almost can’t hear a thing and I’m in the same car.now I have all the money headphones Bose sports ,Bang &Olsen e8 and synthesizer momentum and the AirPods Pro come in to me number one . And I’m basing this on total sound of course the other three  are going to have a little bit more bass but just a little . Even using the app software on the other three I still give it to the AirPods Pro because they are more balanced and the sound Volume is loud enough that you may have to turn it down some.software on airpods can even make sure you have a good seal that no sound is leaking out  of your ear it’s unbelievable.', 'Disappointed. Compared to my previous standard AirPods, the pros have great noise cancellation and are more comfortable. I also think they charge faster and the mic has better sound isolation. I do find they fall out of my ears way more frequently. Sometimes they just constantly pop out and it\\'s really annoying. Switching to the smaller tips helped a little but didn\\'t fix it. I also started having technical problems with these when they were brand new. Often the buds won\\'t charge even if the case is fully charged. I can\\'t figure out why - have checked the connection, made sure the ports were clear, made sure they were fully in the case, etc. They just randomly start and stop charging. I have left them charging in the case overnight multiple times only to wake up to them fully dead. Sometimes only one of them will charge and not the other. Often one will connect to my Mac/iPhone while the other won\\'t - the only thing that fixes this is if I \"forget\" them on all devices, restart my computer, fully reset the AirPods, and then reconnect. Keeping them anyway because the sound quality really is great and also the mic on my standard AirPods spontaneously stopped working and I need something for calls/zoom, but I\\'m annoyed that they don\\'t just work the way they\\'re supposed to.', 'First of all These are totally noise canceling but the sound quality is very unsatisfactory it is garbage. I don’t understand why this got so high ratings probably because its futuristic and talks. No third-party earbud earpiece fits these very low quality High pitch mono sounding apple AirPods! bought a pair of Skullcandy‘s that cost $32 and the Skullcandy speakers sound a whole lot better with the right earbud piece. The Skullcandy comes with a good earbud piece but they make better ones that cost A few dollars more but worth the price With that echoey sound that makes it sound like you’re in the sound room. But back to the hi pitch mono  Apple earbuds these are crap look elsewhere! They are not worth the price. They’re loud but without the high definition of sound quality! (Sounds like their in Mono) I repeat the new apple earbuds these are a waste of money, You can find a better pair at the 99 Cents store!', \"This is the first ear bud that actually sounds good and stays in my ear!  Definitely expensive, but I feel it will last quite a while.  I don't work out with them, but due much walking and working with them in and never get tired of these being in my ear!  Charging is fast.  You'll need a charger for these, you just get a cable.  But they are Qi enabled, so I'm fine with that.  Sound clarity and quality is very good!  Rivals some of my over the ear headphones!  Battery life is pretty good and the case is small and compact.  Easy to carry around, not much bulk to them.  I use these for everything, PC Laptop, Mac Mini, iPad, TV, and my Samsung S10+.\", \"4/9: I've had this slip off during running and my ear canals hurt from using this so I decided to return and going back to my original AirPods. I considered a few options: 1. Buy the ear hooks - could work but kinda ugly and they don't fit in the case. 2. Memory foam ear tips - interesting option but not sure it's better than the silicone ones that comes with the AirPods pros. 3. Keeping my gen 1 AirPods for workouts and the pro for everything else. I considered this but the sound quality on the pro isn't so much better that I would use them standalone. I also have over the ear headphones that are far superior to these. 5 / 5 if this fits you comfortably but 2/5 at best if it doesn't - they are fundamentally unusable for me Original post: I've had this for a few days - much more tricky to use than the regular AirPods and almost returned it but getting better to use over time. I think the trick is to use a slightly larger size and twist the AirPods to keep it in place. Not sure it's as comfortable as the original version\", 'Despite reading other reviews here concerning the left airpod breaking, I purchased the product.  Worked okay for almost 2 months, and now the left airpod is dead. When working sound quality was good.  Bit disappointed with the noise cancelation.  Now sound quality is atrocious with just the right airpod working.  I am thankful... was about to buy a set of airpod pros for my wife.  To help others thinking about buying these, I will go in all caps... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW AND OTHERS THAT THE LEFT AIRPOD CAN AND MOST LIKELY WILL DIE ON YOU.', 'Honestly, they’re just so good. I was shocked when I first got them. I wouldn’t label myself an “audiophile”, but I’m a musician and I know good sound quality when I hear it. I’ve always thought Apple’s earbuds were underrated, and legitimately high-quality, and it shouldn’t be a surprise that these are their best yet. The sound quality is amazing. It’s truly hard to believe it’s physically possible for such tiny speakers to create such deep, rich, colorful sounds. Considering their size, the noise cancellation is pretty great, while obviously not as complete as an over-the-ear set. One thing I’m always concerned about is other people being able to hear what I’m listening to. I had the volume up quite loud (for me) and asked my wife - she said she couldn’t hear them at all. The battery life is fine, while not amazing. I tend to get a couple hours or more when they’re set to “off”, and of course a bit less when they’re on noise cancellation or transparency mode. The charging case can fully charge the headphones 2-3 times. Overall an amazing set of headphones that I can’t recommend strongly enough.', 'Let me start by saying that, for the brief time they’re fully functional, I do really enjoy them.  The overall sound quality is a little above average. I think the active noise canceling is every bit as good as my Bose QC 35.  Additionally, they are very convenient. The Bluetooth connection is quick and reliable.  My complaint is that I’m waiting for my third pair because after the first week both of my first two pairs stopped working properly.  They no longer pass the ear tip test. I’ve tried all the tip sizes and of course I’ve adjusted the fit.  Also, the noise cancelling occasionally fails to initiate.  That problem started at the same time they stopped passing the ear tip test.  It’s now happened with two pairs after about the first week of using them. So, once again, I’m in limbo while waiting for another replacement of an item that is perpetually out of stock.  I’ve read everywhere that the Sony model offers much better sound as well as better active noise cancelling, and the cost less!  If I had it to do over again, I would have bought the Sony’s. UPDATE:  After having the same problem with the second pair, I returned them thinking I’d get another replacement.  Well, Amazon has been in possession of the second pair for about thirty six hours and no sign of them sending a replacement.  I called them, and was informed that another replacement isn’t an option.  So, I’m waiting the 1-2 weeks for a refund, at which point I will be buying the Sony’s  CNET and other professional critics have unambiguously said the Sony’s have both better noise-cancelling and sound quality!  They cost less too!', \"I've had these for over 30 days. I've had minor issues with the pods disconnecting to my PC (of course at meeting time), but the major issue is fit. I have large (not abnormal, but big) ears (and apparently ear holes). using the large pads, the pods stay mostly in place; but if I am moving, or talking; especially if eating; they constantly fall out. I am adjusting and repositioning these repeatedly. I fear losing them in public, and someone smashing them. I paid far too much to be having this kind of experience. I would appreciate the seller offering some sort of remedy ( Unsure what that could be)\", 'The fit on these are much better and with the three tip sets included you can find a better fit than you can with \"regular\" AirPods. I could never get the others to feel comfortably set within my ears and they\\'d fall out easily.  These stay in much better, and definitely sound better as well.  With the noise canceling feature on they work surprisingly well too.  Others have covered many of the same points in their reviews, so I won\\'t drag it out.  I will say that I am happy they included a USB-C to Lightning cable instead of the \"regular\" USB cable.  And, with the newest Sept 2020 update, swapping between your Apple devices is seamless as it will do so automatically as long as they\\'re running the most recent version of the OS (iOS 14, iPadOS 14, WatchOS 7, etc.)', 'I’m a fan of apple. I have the first gen of airpods (have them for 2 years now and they still work fine). I wanted to upgrade to the pro for their noise canceling system. The airpods were faulty and customer service did nothing to help me or to try and exchange them because that was “not an option” given. I bought them during prime day (I waited long for this) and when I spoke to them they didn’t want to exchange the airpods or price match it so that I could buy them again after returning the airpods. No help was given until I asked if I could have a credit for the difference I would have to pay to purchase them again. I had to ask this. After 1.5 weeks trying to get answers nobody ever helped me or nobody ever reached back to me. I had to be persistent.', 'I have nothing but trouble with these. They constantly need to be reset and reconnected. The case will be at 100% and the AirPods won’t charge. I’ll pull them out and put them back in and then they will magically charge. Overall, they are a major frustration, however they are the best on the market for what I was looking for. Unfortunately I am stuck with them since there is no truly competitive product that is as seamless to integrate with an iphone. Beware that you might be plagued with problems, constantly having to reset and reconnect or maybe you have battery issues like I do where they always seem to be drained because the case is subpar. My advice: wait until the new version comes out and get those. Clearly these were not run through the debugging phase of testing.', 'Great for work or doing things around the house, they stay in pretty well.  Noise cancellation is pretty good, considering they are \"in ear\" as opposed to \"over ear\".  Music is OK, audio for podcasts and instructional videos is very good. You might think these would be great for making calls too, well, they might be.  If you work in an industrial environment whose noice just can\\'t be cancelled out, they might work fine.  If you work in a quiet location, like your home, (which would be absent the drone of florescent lighting, HVAC constantly running, and the interruptive chatter of the \"open office\",) you might find in call sound to be way too loud even at the lowest setting. Running numerous versions of IOS on iPhone XR has not alleviated the loud in call volume. These would easily get a 4 of 5', 'First, the positives. Very convenient for people heavily into the Apple ecosystem with the automatic switching. Good noise cancelling. The transparency feature is nice. However, on the negative side, the sound quality is not that good with heavy emphasis on bass and lacking in treble. I had issues with the automatic switching. I was watching a movie on my Mac and anytime my iphone screen lit up for notifications, the sound from my Mac got disconnected and it was trying to connect to my iPhone,  which was very annoying. Lastly, there seems to be a design flaw, since no matter which ear tips i tried to use, they kept falling off my ears. Forget about eating or drinking with them on. They would pop out in a few minutes. I’ve had a number of earbuds before, cheap ones too, that would stay in place all day. With those limitations, i could not recommend the airpods pro.', 'The sound is great, the battery life is great, the convenience is great. But HOLY COW, these have amazing noise canceling.  I fly in airplanes 10-20 times per week and have been comparing the noise canceling of these AirPods Pro vs Bose A20 Aviation headset.  The AirPods are so close (within 5-10% as good) but they are small (pocketable), rechargeable, and cost 1/4th as much.  We have at our house some Beats Studio (noise canceling) and Bose QC (noise canceling) which are both \\'slightly\\' better, but so much larger. The other thing thats so amazing about AirPods (I\\'ve owned both the original and AirPods Pro) is that you can clip them on your keychain or slip them in your pocket and you have great headphones and noise canceling with you all the time. Oh yeah, the ability to hold the stem on them to turn off noise canceling is great.  And you can \"hey Siri\" to make phone calls and stuff with them.', 'They\\'re cute and OK, but after trying every tip and even going to the Apple store, my pair never could pass the \"Fit Test\" on the phone so the seal was not great.  As a result the sound was a little thin and the noise cancelation was not perfect (I have noise-cancelling Bose that are much better sounding and noise-cancelling even though they are wired). The icing on the cake was that the Apple store basically told me 1) they don\\'t fit everyone and 2) that I should just enjoy them \"the way they are\"!  For a $250 pair of headphones, that\\'s not acceptable. Wonder if the Genius would have told Tim Cook to just enjoy them the way they are?', 'I had to return the first pair I bought from Amazon because they could not even pair with my iPhone. The second pair is constantly falling from my ears (I tried all available ear cushions) and, what is even worse, randomly disconnects from my phone during phone conversations. I don’t know what to think: whether Amazon is selling knockoffs or whether these “famous” AirPods Pro are just simply bad earphones.', \"The active noise cancellation is good enough to let me listen to podcasts or music while I mow the lawn.  They fit inside my earmuff style hearing protection, which was still not sufficient to hear much of anything with my old wired earbuds.  Not anymore, with these.  In less noisy situations, it pretty much silences everything except whatever audio I'm playing.  Kind of eerie, but also very calming.  I don't think I'm ready to use the noise cancellation while walking down the street, as I can't hear the cars until they are right behind me.  Luckily it's super easy to toggle the noise cancellation.  These are my first wireless headphones, which is making me realize just how often the cable used to get in the way, or get yanked out of my ears.  I haven't tried the new positional audio thing yet.  I don't think it matters to me, but if you watch tv or movies on your phone it is probably really cool.  If I didn't care about the noise cancellation, I would have gotten the cheaper non-pro aidpods, but I really do like that feature.  I know a lot of people were mad at Apple for ditching the headphone jack a few years ago, but I honestly can't see myself using wired headphones with my phone ever again.  Of course at some point I will upgrade from my 6s and lose the headphone jack anyway, but hopefully you know what I mean. :)\", 'These headphones are outstanding! The case for these are relatively small so it makes them very convenient to carry around in your pocket. I’m not an audiophile but I do care about sound quality and these are more than enough for anybody out there, sound quality is just great, especially when you pair these with the highest audio quality setting offered in a few streaming services such as Apple Music, Spotify, or SoundCloud+. Whenever I’m in a public setting, I always love to enable noise cancellation and for the most part it does a good job in cancelling out the noises around me. It’s sort of mid when it comes to cancelling out chatting from the public around you, but for noises such as a fan, heater, wind, rain, etc… the noises are near eliminated. (I sometimes use them to block out/reduce the cries of my baby nephew!) I can also have these on for about a few hours without feeling any sort of discomfort, having Transparency Mode enabled makes it feel like you have nothing plugging your ear which makes it really comfortable for longer-use sessions. Battery Life for me hits around 4-5 hours of usage and whenever they run low I can easily pop them back into the case for an extra 15 minutes and come off with another 1-2 hours of battery life which is everything that I’ll need for the time being. Recharging the case is sort of a struggle as Apple recommends using their better charging brick (forgot what it was called) which can run you around $20-$30 extra but I feel with a regular iPad charging brick or wireless charging port, that’s more than enough really. The AirPods charge quickly it’s just the case that can fall behind, but if you’re able to balance it out, trust me you’ll be feeling alright with the way charging speeds can be. Overall these headphones are simply great and can make for a great gift! I highly recommend these if you own any iPhone, iPad, or any MacBooks. Connectivity is very simple and transitioning from devices is smooth, fast, and very simple. Highly recommend! 5 Stars here!', \"I've had a fair amount of earbuds and headphones. The sound quality is pretty good and I would even describe it as nostalgic. The sound reminds me of being a kid/teenager on the bus with the wired Apple earbuds listening to music. I'm not saying the sound quality is the same, more of how the equalization of the frequencies is still very similar. The noise cancelling is nothing revolutionary but it's good. The hear through is quite good. My only complaint was the fit. It hurt my ears to wear them and they would also fall out. I tried getting memory foam tips since a friend recommended that to fix the comfort and falling out issue, but it didn't. I have to return them since they're just way too uncomfortable and even painful to wear.\", 'Bought these AirPod Pros for my sons birthday and within a week he went back to his old AirPods with the stalks saying the new AirPods Pros didn’t fit no matter which tips he used. UGG!! $250 down the drain. He said and I agree they really don’t sound any better than the old AirPods. The noise cancellation is noticeable BUT no where near as effective as noise cancellation on his over the ear Sony 1000XM2. Even with the AirPod Pro noise cancellation on you can still hear surrounding voices but they are muffled. Having both the old AirPods and the AirPod Pros I can tell you the Pros are not worth upgrading to.  I would also try a pair before I bought them because the fit is hit or miss.', 'These are fantastic. Literally the most magical technology I think I’ve purchased to date. I was going to go with the Bose wireless, noise cancelling head phones. They are somewhat comparable in price, and known to be good quality, and Apple didn’t have any similar products. Plus I never was impressed with the quality of the Apple ear buds or AirPods anyway. They always fell out. But then the AirPods pros came out. Similarly priced to Bose, but 1) because I’m already an Apple user, I thought it would be easier to use with my iPhone, 2) they are truly wireless, and 3) they come with a nifty case that also quickly charges the earbuds wirelessly multiple times. That being said, I’m in love with them and I swear they are the most magical piece of technology I’ve ever owned. I’m no audio expert and I don’t use them for music much (nor am I an audio quality snob), so I can’t speak to the sound quality. But I use them on construction sites to help cancel engine noise while also being able to listen to podcasts at a lower volume, and for that they are absolutely perfect. Without having quantitative measurements, it feels like they cancel noise to about the same degree as ear plugs. They don’t fall out of my ears as I’m walking around and I use them pretty much all day. I’ve even used them underneath ear muffs. I can’t recommend these enough. Apple got it right finally.', \"The new Apple AirPods Pro are a nice addition to the Apple line up. The previous version is still a good product, but the addition of the noise cancellation feature is a nice addition. It takes a little getting used to, if you do not have a current pair of noise cancelling headphones. The new design is a nice feature as well. They are smaller in feature, and I find them to fit better in my ears then the previous versions due in large part to the soft, replaceable ear tips. The talk quality is amazing, and I find the use of the controls on the AirPods Pro to be much more user friendly than previous versions. All in all, if you are looking for a streamlined pair of noise cancelling headphones, this will probably do the trick for you, but if that is not a necessary feature for you, then you don't need to rush right out and get them.\", 'These are great if you can get them to stay in. Tried all ear fitting pieces and no luck. My fix has been to wear these with hearing protection earmuffs. That’s a pretty good chunk of money for earbuds that just keep falling out. Maybe some duck tape will work. Edit: I should add, I spend a lot of time on a tractor looking over my shoulder at the ground. I also spend a lot of time in the woods cutting trees. These do work great when I’m sitting listening to a book or standing at my bench sharpening chains and suck. I do like these but they are not for heavy work. I prefer my Bose 700 over ear headphones', \"I've owned these for several months now and am pretty disappointed.  Two main areas of disappointment are the sound quality and that they continue to fall out of my ears.  First, the fit.... I was really hopeful the multiple tip options would solve the fact the earlier model would fall out if I'm at all active.  After trying multiple tip configurations they still fall out if I'm doing any activity where I bend down.  Very frustrating!  I'm also disappointed with the sound quality at the higher volume range and the lack of bass.  I would not recommend the Apple AirPods.\", \"Compared to competitor earbuds like the Echo buds and others for which I have tried, I would have to say the sound quality is only ok. Nothig special. I felt like these offered more Highs than anything else. The Noise Cancellation and pass through was by far not what one expects when you read those words. The amazon echo blew these out of the water in both noise cancellation and pass-through. The battery life was great overal and had no complaints with that. The overall ease of use with apple products i would for sure give 5 starts as these connected with such ease. These are also terrible for small eared people as they dont stay in at all. I could barely walk without them falling out and that's with using the given ear fitment pieces. I just felt here is better choices for my needs and also being a home controlled by alexa i felt the echos again came out ahead of apple.\", 'Honestly? Not worth the money. I was buying for the noise cancellation and it really isn’t that great. It’s not cancellation. It’s a slight reduction. I still hear everything. I bought these while elder-sitting my Dad as he watches CNN at mind blowing volume levels. It didn’t filter out cnn. I went outside and traffic noise is oddly augmented. It’s got some good features. It knows when you pull them out of your ear it pauses. If they were $59 probably worth it. The noise cancellation is kind of a scam. I don’t understand all the people who say it is amazing. It’s barely anything really.  I’ll be sending back I think.', 'I really like my AirPods but there are a few issues that I have with them. Sometimes they take a bit to connect, also when you open the case and have your phone unlocked a pop up is supposed to come on your screen that shows you the battery life of the case and the pods however that only happens about 30% of the time. There is a widget you can download for that so it’s not a big deal. Battery life is okay, not as good as they say it is though. Overall they are decent, in my opinion they are not worth the money but I got a great deal on them for applying for the prime card so all in all I’m not upset about it. I was initially very impressed with the noise cancellation. I wish they would have higher volume settings.', 'These are a great way to listen to audio books, your favorite books, or even just to mute lots of noisy background in general. We have been using them for over a year now without any issues. They are a better fit for my husband. If I am sitting I have no issues. I do sometimes have the sensation they are going to fall out of my ears if I am moving around a lot. I have tried the different ear pieces but I just may not be inserting them correctly or not using the correct one. The sound quality is excellent and the noise cancellation is soooo nice.', \"The buds do not fit well in my ear. The noise cancellation only works if you buds in BOTH ear canals; if use only one there is no noise cancellation. To control the buds you have to use the case? Am I wrong that's ridiculous. Of course with almost all Apple new products; gear up for a whole new set of adapters, ports, chargers etc. I regret buying them. I am sure others have no issues with my complaints.\", 'These are expensive, but they are worth it. They sound great and the noise cancelling is majestic. The battery life is not too bad, but a little lame. The good news is that the case charges them too, so at least you can top them off whenever you are not using them. I use these a lot for phone calls. The sound quality is good and I have never had any complaints on the other end either. That is a big improvement from anything else I have ever tried before. I enjoyed these enough that I also bought my wife a pair. (She had also been stealing my pair from time to time, so I had a heads up that she enjoyed them as well.) She has only positive things to say about them as well.', \"No fuss connection to your Apple devices (iPhone) and other devices, very good sound quality, battery life and convenience really make it stand out and makes it a clear no-brainer decision. Sound quality: Very good detail that makes me want to listen to all my old tracks and I can hear detail I couldn't hear before. Low frequency (bass) quality can be difficult to implement and for its size, it is really impressive. Meaning that I don't find anything lacking really. Battery life: Excellent. No problems so far. Noise cancellation: Very good. I can still hear some sound frequencies from the outside but it effectively drowns out jet engine noise on a plane for the most part, but not all voice frequencies, is what I have observed. Con: People have told me that during phone calls my voice is not very clear and that background noise is more prominent. I am still tweaking it and trying to find a setting that may mitigate this issue. Not sure if there is one.\", 'While the sound quality is excellent, the fit sucks. The Airpod Pro comes with 3 different size rubber cups. If your ear canal does not accommodate one of these 3 various sizes, then you might consider yourself SOL. My Airpods are constantly falling out of my ears and its a very frustrating experience. Today one of them fell out of my ear right into a pale of water. It now suffers from water damage. Very disappointing!', 'Honestly kept my expectations neutral, and I’m pretty impressed. I’ve had many cheap wireless headsets and they do the job, but some of the AirPod features I haven’t experienced till now. Take out an AirPod and the music stops. Put it back in and the music starts again. Amazing battery life and sound. Noise cancellation was a wow moment. I had ocean waves sound playing on Alexa, and when I put the AirPods in the sound was wiped out.  Also they are so light. I hardly feel them in my ears. I’m sure you can pay half the price for “some” of these features, but Apple is my love. :) They provide an ease of use, and high quality reliable products that make them worth every penny. Enjoy!', 'Would recommend 9/10 There are only a couple of things that I don’t absolutely love about these. The battery life is not as good as their predecessors. They can tend to sort of way down here a year after a little bit but possibly less than the first version. I do really like having the adjustable silicone pieces. What you get when you buy these here is sealed. You get everything that comes in the box brand new. I am absolutely in love with these I love the noise cancellation/transparency it is super useful when I need to hear what is going on around there for brief periods of time, or cancel out noise around me. The wireless charging seems to be a little bit hit and miss especially with the case, but overall I’m happy with these, and would recommend', 'For this review I am not going to compare these to any other type of headphones only earbuds. Yes there are a few products out there that have slightly better sound performance however those are big bulky and ugly. Also they do not work cross platform or as amazingly with Apple products. Fit, comfort, sound, performance, and style. These have them all. Can’t wait to see what miracles Apple comes up with in future updates. Sky is the limit with these earphones. They seem to know what I’m doing and what I need. I’ve actually had them automatically pause once I’ve started a conversation. They are your assistant and your entertainer all in one. I got some memory foam tips and they just become a part of me. To date I don’t believe there are any other earbuds that integrate so well with Apple’s products as AirPods Pro.', '😊Great fit in the ears👍 😊 Great noise cancelling for me 👍 😊 Great music sound👍 😊 Great little charging and carry on container when you are not wearing them. 👍 I had a similar charging case for a Plantronics, which did not work sometime if the headphone did not align in the case properly. 😒 Phone conversation quality of sound really good on my end but really crappy on the other end. Really disappointing. 👎. The best I ever had for phone conversation that I have are the Plantronics Legend series of headphones. They cut the noise on my end to project my voice so the other end can hear me clearly even when I’m in noisy environment. I wish they made something like this in stereo for both ears. 😒Too pricey. There are other great choices from Bose, Sony, LG, Plantronics and others. You would only like these prices if you are all things Apple.👎', 'This is the first Apple product I’ve ever been truly disappointed in. I feel the previous version was such an overall better product. I mostly wear mine for running and workout activities. Taking out the tap options was a big loss. Trying to grab these things the way you need to during a run or intervals moves them around and possibly pulls them out. The software doesn’t even have the option to go back to that. They sound just as good as the previous ones, even a little better. They just don’t fit or stay in your ear as well unless your just going to sit in one spot. An expensive mistake as I’ll more than likely switch back to my previous pods for the majority of use.', \"These are the first earbuds that I've owned that I really like. The fit is perfect for me right out of the box. I can move around the house doing various activities throughout the day without fear of them falling out or constantly needing to be readjusted. As others have commented, the sound is not audiophile quality, but for ear buds I think the quality is fantastic. The noise cancellation works quite well - I can filter out most of the noise made by my boys in the house while listening to music or watching a movie on my iPhone. Thus far, I'm really impressed. The only bummer is that I have to get out my MacBook Pro to have something to plug them into for charging. I'll eventually get a wireless charger, but it would have been nice to have a fully functional plug included for charging considering the cost.\", 'In my opinion this is much better than the old AirPod version. I like the fact that I can squeeze my right AirPod and play/pause/skip songs without having to call Siri and I can squeeze the left AirPod to call Siri and ask her to increase/decrease volume (I just wish I could adjust the volume without invoking Siri). Also, unlike the old version, these AirPods stay in my ears and I don’t have to worry about them falling off. And when charging them I don’t need to remove the silicone eartips. Note that if you own the Anker wireless charger you may experience some issues charging AirPods. Per Anker their wireless chargers are designed to charge phones, not AirPods.', \"I had used AirPods Pro for two days before I decided to return it. It would be excellent, had it fit. I have AirPods 2 and Bose QuiteComfort 35 II. The noise cancellation on AirPods Pro is excellent for earbuds, very close to Bose QC35 II (I would say about 80% the capability). The sound quality is also great, slightly better than AirPods 2. Combined with noise cancellation, it would be a worthy upgrade from AirPods 2. The problem for me is the fit. After using it for 1-2 hours, I started to feel pain from my ears. The pods push my ear auricles a little too much, I think. The silicon tips are soft and do not cause any problem to my ear canal. It's the size and/or shape of the pods. I still give AirPods Pro a rating of four stars. If I use it for under one hour, the fit is OK; but I have to use it for long Zoom meetings. Fitting is personal, so for many other people, it may just work well. I wish that in the future, Apple would make a new version of AirPods Pro based on the non-Pro version. Just wish.\", 'I wouldn’t expect such a terrible quality of product from Apple. These buds are flimsy and ver poorly built. Already lost like 4 pairs of the plastic pieces because they don’t seem to fit well and come apart almost every time I take them off my ears. Then a few months in, the right ear bud quit charging. You have to really press it down and wiggle it a little to find a good connection with the case. Tried cleaning the case but nothing worked. Disappointed. Waste of money', 'This review is mostly geared towards active/athletic use, but for normal day use these AirPods are more than adequate. They have great dynamic range and clarity. The provided silicone attachments should cover most ear sizes. However, if different type/sizes are required they need to be specific to AirPods, because the connection and oval shape. For active/normal use, if you have already used the previous AirPod models, these are definitely a nice upgrade. They sound as if a subwoofer was added, which is great. But there are some specific drawbacks. First, when using silicone attachments there is a vacuum seal. If you are not used to having silicone attachments, this can take some getting used to, especially when running. There is a noticeable boom noise on your eardrums when your body is in motion, because of the vacuum seal. You have to crank up the volume to compensate. This may not work for some users. Second, the noise cancellation and transparency settings do not work as well when in motion, or if you have a hat on that covers the AirPods. The computer chip tries to compensate, but distorts the audio a bit to where clarity of sound is worse when they’re enabled. Probably because the chip has to work extra hard at dealing with constant external noise changes. Turning off the settings works much better for clarity in motion. For normal everyday use, the noise cancellation and transparency settings work quite well. I work in an office that uses white noise generators, and the noise cancellation setting blocks everything out. Transparency works good, but you still have to turn down the volume if you want to have a conversation with someone at the same time. So to summarize: Pros: 1. Sound quality is much improved from previous models.  Dynamic range is much greater. 2. Battery life appears to be better, especially when talking. 3. The pause/next/prev song clicking options are a nice feature. 4. Siri enabled control is a bonus. 5. Shorter tip design. 6. Wireless charging. 7. Bluetooth connection with iPhone is virtually flawless at way more than 33ft (more like 100ft), even in a busy gym environment, and pairs in seconds. 8. AirPods automatically connect to last known device when inserting them in ears. 9. Music/Audio will pause/resume automatically when pulling out from/putting back into ear. Cons: 1. Vacuum seal of silicone attachments causes eardrum booming noise when body in motion. 2. Noise cancellation and transparency settings distort audio when body in motion. 3. Removing AirPods from charging case is not so easy, especially when fingers are moist. 4. Provided charging cable uses USB-c connection, which means a different wall adapter for charging is required.', 'This is the headphones I have been waiting for. When the original AirPods were released I wasn’t impressed- the open nature and absence of noise canceling didn’t appeal to me. I remained a loyal Plantronics user with their mono noise canceling sets. When this arrived I had to check it out. The smaller form factor and amazing noise canceling keeps this well and above the original AirPods. The transparency mode keeps the commuters and family conversations going. Only ask is for a longer battery life. I am sure Apple will figure that out with future upgrades. Worth buying for the ease of use - specially if you are in the Apple ecosystem it is a no brainer.', \"Short and sweet review here. Sound quality is very nice. Not the best I've ever heard, but solid none the less. The buds themselves are very comfortable and don't fall out. Noise cancellation is surprisingly very good for earbuds. The touch controls so far are a bit wonky, but I'll probably just control everything from my phone anyway. My only gripe thus far is the case. It's nice and the magnetic closure and magnets that hold the buds are great. However the lid moves ever so slightly back and forth when closed and makes this little clicking noise. Seems like a design flaw that makes it feel a bit cheap. Not the end of the world or a deal breaker though. I've seen other reviews that mention it too. Are these worth the price tag? Not so sure just yet as I've only had them for a day. But with the convenience of Amazon's return process, it's worth a shot if your on the fence. I had some gift cards to blow so I said screw it and bought them. No buyers remorse though, I'm happy with them.\", \"Having been a loyal Bose customer for many years, I didn't see myself ever buying Apple Airpods. I had replaced my Bose QC-30 yearly for 3 years for free (under warranty) before the third headset physically broke in half leading to replacement purchase of Bose QuietComfort® Earbuds with super satisfying results until they stopped working after 6 months. With no Bose retail store to obtain same day warranty replacement, I decided to \\xa0purchase Airpods Pro to replace and compare. To say I'm a demanding user is an understatement with several hours of daily use including bedtime (can't sleep without noise cancelation). This review is based on my first impressions after less than one hour after unboxing my AirPods Pro. Apple unboxing is always a pleasure, they know how to focus on great first impressions. I pulled the charging case out of the box, opened the case, placed near my iPhone and it immediately paired, automatically named my Airpods using my first name and showed me that i had 30% charge.\\xa0Ready in under a minute. As many have reported, the charging case is much smaller than Bose and fits much easier into front jeans pocket. They just look cooler as well. I plugged them into my ear and my first impression was that the noise cancelation was more than adequate and eliminated the sounds of fans throughout my house on a hot summer day (can't wait to compare with my Bose after warranty replacement). Luckily the first song played from my Playlist was one of my favorites (Pearl Jam cover of Crazy Mary from 2003 tour stop in Champaign, IL) and these did not disappoint. I'll provide more details later but they have brighter highs than bose and still deliver good low end. Need to listen to a broader sample of musical genres to really do that justice. I suspect it will take a week to do full comparison in the variety of listening scenarios but already like this purchase more than expected. Updated: I’ve just received my replacement Bose QC Earbuds and after just a few minutes find them to be far superior to the AirPods Pro buds. The Airbuds Pro sounds tinnier, good highs but the midrange and lows nowhere compare to Bose. And the noise cancellation doesn’t compare with Bose clearly superior. I’ll be gifting the AirPods Pro to a family member…\", 'These things are amazing. I usually can’t wear these types of ear buds cause they fall out of my ears but with the multiple sized silicone tips, it gives you a few options to find ones that fit. Your phone will actually tell you if they fit properly by checking the seal. The best part of these is that they pause automatically when you take one out so there is no more fumbling to try and pause whatever you’re listening to. The noise cancelling could be a little better but pretty good for ear buds. All in all, I’m kicking myself for not buying these sooner.', \"I am such a critique of Apple products but I have to give it to them for Airpod Pros. After having tried several wireless (in- and over-the-ear) earphones, I am simply blown away. They stay in ear, have great sound quality and such lovely noise cancelling. They pair seamlessly, and I truly enjoy the whether I am stationary or exercising. I can't recommend these earphones enough. Don't think further (especially, if you are looking at other comparable ones like Jabra Elite 75ts). Just make it easy on yourself and buy these.\", 'After about 20 minutes they pop out of my ears. I’ve spent so much time looking for these stupid things. My Airpods never fell out of my ears while walking or sitting. Doesn’t matter what size of ear tips I use. They sound great but what good are they if they won’t stay in your ears? Update May 1st 2020 - after a firmware update they disconnect constantly but not both at once.  Usually the right air pod pro disconnects followed by the left about 3-4 minutes later.  I can’t even use them for conference calls or music because they just cause trouble. My wife’s do the exact same thing. We both have 2019 iPads and iPhone 11 pro’s. Very disappointed.', 'Los AirPods vinieron empacados y se supone que son nuevos de paquete pero tienen un color amarillento en la parte inferior. Espero que no se sigan amarillando. Ni siquiera mis antiguos AirPods con dos años después uso les ha sucedido.', 'I have had AirPods for many years and didn’t know if I should upgrade or not.  I have talked with other that had them and they really like them.  My original pair of AirPods were damaged due to water (my fault), so I decided to upgrade.  I’m very glad I did.  They do fit different and sound different.  I still like the original pair as well, but these are slightly better sound and the noise cancelling is awesome.  This would get the most use from me when traveling, but is nice to easily switch it on and off during normal use too.  I would purchase again without hesitation!!', \"If you have an Apple device, AirPods are great options for your audio needs.  The microphone in them works well.  If you pair these with your iPhone or Mac - they are easy to use. Sound quality is pretty good.  The Pro's sound nicer than the original AirPods.  I'm sure you can buy better sounding headphones, but wonder if they are compact as these. The case supports wireless charging.  I'm a big fan as I hate cables. I charge the case daily.  I get about a full day of use - in an 8 hour time period, I might use these 3-5 hours somedays. I do think they are on the pricey side.  However, if you bought an Apple product, you are already aware of this.\", 'Pricy, pricy, pricy! But it does sound great, works great on airplane and public transportation. I had both Bose QC35 and Bose Headphones 700, and I used to swear by them and couldnt do my business travels without them. But I ditched them for my airpod pros now. The airpod pro is not as quiet as either of the Bose NC headphones, but its is \"good enough\" and the portability and the comfort trumps the slightly better NC performance of the Bose. The ONLY thing, please try to get a tether for them if you are planning to sleep on a plane with them.... you may lose them during your sleep...', 'Incredibly disappointed with this product. The connectivity is incredibly poor and the battery life is awful. They worked fine for the first two months and now the left AirPod discharges to 0% in minutes. They connect and disconnect to my phone all the time too. I spend more time trying to figure out how to troubleshoot these things to work then I do actually using them. I wish I could return them but the window passed by a few weeks. I should have returned them right when I saw they started to have connectivity issues. I currently can’t even get them to reconnect to my phone after attempting to reset them. I highly recommend you look at a different product. I previously was using the wireless sports Beats headphones and those never gave me problems. I got wrapped up in the AirPods hype and paid the price of now having worthless headphones.', 'I was pleased to experience my first time with my AirPod pros. When you put them on and have noise cancellation off, you can clearly hear people talking to you. I previously had $50 Jlab earbuds for 2 or 3 years & always hated the muffled sound so I couldn’t hear others around me with them in my ears. It would also make me nauseous and not release the pressure in my ear. These AirPod pros do a phenomenal job at releasing pressure, although from time to time for my own comfort I do give my ears a break since my body doesn’t do the best with not hearing the real world. The buttons on the AirPod pros are great to use, just wish sometimes you could adjust the volume without having to go to your phone to adjust. Sound quality is top notch. Was hesitant for the longest time to buy these due to price and if I were to lose them. So far have only used for travel and walking outside or at home. Have yet to use them on a run but probably won’t since I like to be mindful of cars around me & don’t want to risk losing my airpod pros on a run. They were well worth the money and I do not regret it! Also I recommend watching a YouTube video on how to switch out the AirPod pro 3 different sizes of buds. It feels like you will break your AirPod pros when you switch them out to find the best fit but finally got mine to work well with the help of a video.', 'Let\\'s start off with the good - these headphones have great sound quality (although you only get deep bass if you really stick them into your ear, which probably isn\\'t a great idea). They\\'re comfortable and have decent noise cancellation. They seemed to work pretty decently for the first few months... Then the problems started mounting up. I\\'d say about half the time I try to use them now, one of the ears doesn\\'t work. I charge the AirPod case after almost every use even though they\\'re supposed to last for 4 hours because they never last nearly that long. Most of the time I pull them out of the case, one ear is charged and the other is dead. Sometimes putting them back in the case, closing, re-opening the case will fix this issue, but a lot of times it doesn\\'t. They\\'re supposed to turn off when you put them back in the case and close them, but a lot of times I notice that they\\'ll randomly turn on and sync with my phone throughout the day, draining the battery. I now disable bluetooth on my phone while not using them to prevent this. I\\'d say there\\'s a good 50/50 chance at least one AirPod won\\'t work when I take them out of the case, even immediately after they\\'ve \"charged\" - green light and everything. My wife also has a pair of AirPod Pros that she purchased around the same time (about a year ago) - she has the exact same issues with hers, so unless we both got faulty pairs it seems that this just happens with AirPod Pros after regular use. Another con that I wish I considered before I bought them - the audio quality for listening to music / podcasts is very good, but when you use them on phone calls they go into a separate \\'headset\\' mode and the quality is horrendous. Night and day difference when using wired Apple earbuds, which have much better phone call quality. This isn\\'t a deal breaker necessarily, but for the price it\\'s extremely disappointing. To sum up: they sound great and have good noise cancelling, but if they only work about 50% of the time after charging them, what\\'s the point? I still have to keep a wired pair of earbuds handy because I simply can\\'t rely on these to hold a charge or sync properly. I want to like these so bad, because they\\'re so close to being amazing, but at the end of the day I very much regret this purchase. Only get them if they\\'re heavily discounted.', \"I wanted to get these because of the small sleek design, and wow what an incredible sound quality and noise cancellation .  I also own a pair of beats studio 3 headphones super nice quality headphones as well just not the same in size and although bass tends to sound better with the studio 3 headphones, its almost expected due to the over the ear design and size . Although i haven't wanted to use my beats since ive purchased these Airpod pros they are incredible . The battery life is great wireless charging is nice and the Noise cancellation is so good i cant hear  a thing when its turned on . and easily switched to transparency mode by holding the post. find my airpods feature is great as well .  doesnt come with charging box which seems problematic for some but i own a macbook pro so i just can use that box if needed, although i only charge with wireless charging pad.  I totally recommend this purchase if you have the extra bucks. Apple is of course always spendy, but remember you get what you pay for!  2 months later im still super pleased with my purchase.. only negative i will say is when in noisy locations like public transit phone calls are hard to make with them in because of the background noise is picked up so extremely well . Other than that i have no probs with them ... oh and Amazon wont ship this item to locker for some reason which is inconvenient.\", \"I bought Airpods Pro over Powerbeats Pro for one reason and one reason only: Noise Cancelation. Unfortunately, that doesn't matter because they refuse to stay in my ear and fall out over and over. Fixing them while they are sliding out requires touching them which almost always pauses the music forcing you to stop what you are doing. I will be purchasing the Powerbeats Pro for the hook alone now. Very disappointed. The only good thing I can say about the Airpods Pro is that the Noise Cancelation IS worth it if they fit your ears fine. My cousin has a pair and has never had one fall out in years since they came out. Could be just people with small or large ear holes idk what size mine are. LOL this got weird. Anyway, may the force be with you.\", 'The only reason I got the Airpod Pro was to get the full experience of the Apple ecosystem. The verdict is it doesn’t compensate the flaws. The super quick connection is very convenient but ever since the last updates I am experiencing random disconnection from my iPhone 12 Pro Max and my 16” Macbook Pro. Well the Macbook had bluetooth issue since day one. Apple products have a premium price tag for their design and reputation but their quality has been gradually diminishing since the passing of Steve Jobs. The only thing “pro” about these earbuds is the noise cancellation feature. The sound quality is not noticeably different. If you want premium sound, you’ll have a better chance with other rivaling companies.', 'Updating rating from 4 to 2.  About three months after purchase and use, my son has complained about a buzzing noise in one ear pod.  I’m tired of him complaining and we do not have a local Apple store to take product in for a quick check.  Will be contacting Apple as this issue has been going on for a year and we were told to update the app/apps Blah blah blah.  Otherwise, my son has taken care of these and not lost anything, nor have I washed them due to being left in any pockets I don’t check.  That’s a big deal.', 'This is a great product and has been working flawlessly for me ever since I bought them. Taking away a star as I believe they are overpriced. It seems the Apple of today holds certain features back from the \"standard\" version only so they can release a \"pro\" version at a higher price point. While Apple products have always been relatively expensive, it seems the Steve Jobs era Apple would at least pack upgraded features into a new model without increasing the price. Now, new features also come with a new price point, which is unfortunate.', 'Love Apple products. These work tremendously well with phone, watch, etc. Sound quality is fantastic, never though I\\'d appreciate transparency mode as much as I do. Sound cancellation is good but not like over-the-ear cancelling headphones. Big problem is they just don\\'t stay in if you move around at all. Unless you have a \"standard\" ear configuration you will be challenged. I had to buy separate ear hooks which work but don\\'t fit in the case so they have to go on/off to put the buds away. Unfortunately I\\'m going to go back to Bose for my next buds as the #1 thing I need this for is working out, never had an issue with Bose Soundsport or Jaybird Vista in this regard.', 'Ever since I got my AirPods Pro, I’ve used them every day. They’re great for comfort at work, they stay in my ears good at the gym, and they’re kind of stylish. I bought a case for them in advance from Velvet Caviar (go check them out so your AirPods case isn’t so boring) so they’re not only protected now on the off-chance that I drop them but they’re also fashionably cute. The noise cancellation is great for whenever I’m watching something on my iPad or iPhone while my parents watches TV and the audio is super clear. Compared to the regular AirPods, the difference to me is like day and night — it’s just that good. My case can go for about 3 or 4 days without needing a charge and while keeping the actual AirPods charged at 100% (yes I tested this). The AirPods Pro is more discreet for at work and just using one in one of my ears still allows me to work without missing anything thanks to its transparency mode. 5/5, I only have good things to say about the AirPods Pro.', 'I bought these for noise cancellation and only for noise cancellation. Ha ha ha! Thanks, Apple, for curing me of my gullibility to the tune of three bills (yeah, three, because this crap falls out of your ears with the greatest of ease, and so you better buy the Apple Care). I will NEVER wear these outside, not ever. There’s a sucker born every minute, and I am one.', 'loved my air pods but now after about 3 yrs one has a battery of about 10 min and the other of about an hour. So thought I would upgrade and I HATE THESE. No matter what size I use they fall out of my ears.  Not a fan of shoving them in my ears and having this weird sensation either.  I typically wear one only because I need to hear when I am biking etc.  The first generation earpods never fall out when I am skiing, biking etc.  These fall out when I am cleaning the house! I LOVE apple products normally these are just annoying.  Plus the push button stop pause etc was going to be an issue with skiing.  Usually I just bang my helmet twice and can go. This was not going to be great.  Just bought a new pair of the normal ones.  First miss with Apple engineering IMHO', 'These AirPods are amazing and worth every cent! I live with some very loud people and the noise cancellation mode has seriously saved my sanity at times. The different sizes of silicone ear tips really help ensure you have the best fit for your ear. The battery life is wonderful as well and I love being able to just stick the AirPods back in the case to charge. Also in case anyone reading this isn’t aware, if you have a Nintendo switch, AirPods are now Bluetooth compatible with the console and in my opinion they make gaming much more immersive and fun. Thanks for reading and buy these! They’re 100% worth the price, especially when on sale. Ps. These do not come with a wall charger, only the cable, as the description says. However you don’t need to buy a special wall charger if you have an iPhone. The iPhone charging cable and wall charger will charge the AirPods case just the same. Don’t be like me and buy a special wall charger just for these lol.', 'Saw these on Amazon for all of $169.99 on the morning of the first Amazon Prime day. I was all in on the older Air Pods (not wireless). No need to upgrade but I couldn’t resist the Prime day price, so I bought them. When riding our spin bike the chain makes a lot of noise. Always has, since day one. The Pro Air Pods have completely covered the bike noise. Seriously I don’t hear anything as I used too with my older Air Pods. Sound quality is also far better. Highs are higher. And the Lows are lower. Can’t speak to battery yet since this is day one. Set up was easy peezy. Took like 20 seconds and this includes doing the ear fit test. I would never have purchased these on sale at $219. But $169?  Who could say no? Great buy.', 'These are not worth the money at all. I had the first generation before this and got the newest generation that came out after these (not that great either), and these are the worst of the three. I found them to be extremely uncomfortable to the point where I could only use them for a couple minutes at a time. I tried every size ear cushion, but they still hurt my ear. I also didn’t care for the noise canceling feature. Depending on the situation, it could be dangerous. And you aren’t able to hear all that great in transparency mode either. Apple is definitely overcharging for a low quality product. For the price, I expected a lot more. If you just have to have airpods, I would suggest sticking with the first generation until apple is able to produce a better quality product.', \"I just purchased a second pair of AirPods Pro, this recent one is for my husband who has significant hearing loss in his right ear. I figure the flex silicone tips sealing deep into the ear may help him hear better, as he loves his music. The option to toggle between Active Noise Canceling and Transparency modes is what sets these ear buds apart from previous versions. I'm really enjoying the sound quality too, my husband, however, will have to wait until Xmas... ;) BTW, I love the new Amazon GPSing of package delivery while 'Out for Deliver'. I can view a map of my area with the real-time location of the delivery truck and how many stops away it is.  Absolutely awesome!\", 'I like them better than my Bose \"wired\" noise cancellation headphones. I previously bought a relatively cheap set of earbuds but these blow them away. Transparency mode is nice and my friends tell me phone calls are clear. There seems to be a minor delay when using the phone but frankly there are several other factors with my cell service that may be contributing. Not enough to really bother me. The noise cancellation eliminates the noise of my fans and air conditioner and helps when I am using my gas powered, power washer. I do wish the little downward protrusion (antenna?) was a bit shorter but what the heck... The bass response is great and the overall sound, to me, is outstanding. I am very happy with my purchase.', \"The audio quality on these is better than the standard AirPods, and so is the mic.  I've always had problems with connection issues inside my apartment with wireless headsets, but not this one! The noise cancellation is also fantastic. However They kept falling out of my ears.  Both sides would work their way loose and pushing them back in was getting annoying very quickly.  I'm not sure why they didn't stick with the AirPod design because this is inferior; a true step backwards.  I had to buy a non apple product to get them to stay in. 4 out of 5 because they wouldn't stay in.  Everything else was fantastic.\", 'These AirPods do everything they are suppose to.  I personally struggle with just how much they cancel out noise.  They are great for when you are riding your bike, at the gym working out listening to music but trying to drive my car with them in takes some getting use to.  I have had them for a month now and I am still struggling.  I like the original ones better.  If I take out the left earpiece while driving or if I want to have a conversation with someone that is with me it seems to help.', 'It’s a good pair of earbuds but that’s about it. Mediocre in every aspect really. It gets the job done. I bought it because the microphone performance is better than competitors. However, I expect this to work better with apple products, being an apple product itself: it does not connect to two devices(ie. iPhone and iPad) at the same time. It’s so frustrating. It can pair multiple devices, but you can’t hit play on another device and AirPod switch to that device automatically, Bose can do it. If microphones is not your priority and you have this amount of money, buy the Sony 1000xm3', \"Great product for voice conversations. Ok product for music. The Air Pod Pro's don't have a lot of fidelity. You won't get that punchy wide range musical presence from these air pods. Exceptional Bluetooth connectivity and range. Fair noise cancellation and transparency modes. The Transparency mode makes it easier to hear surrounding sounds Noise cancellation significantly downgrades the music. Bottom line---excellent for conversation Choose another ear phone if you listen to a lot of music.\", 'I can’t express how much I love these. I did loads of research looking for a cheaper alternative and a better value. I arrived back at the AirPods pro and they have not disappointed! I just recently took a 4 hr flight from Dallas to Seattle with kids crying and annoying people playing music out of their phones. The ANC was a game changer! It made a normally frustrating flight, enjoyable. I was able to relax and listen to music the whole time. This feature alone makes them worth their weight in gold in my opinion! They are suspiciously comfortable as well. In fact, the most comfortable in ear headphones I’ve ever used. I had to get used to them a bit but after a day of adjustment I hardly even notice them in my ears anymore. If you have the money, I wouldn’t hesitate to snag these.', 'Looking for more battery life then regular AirPods?  This is it.  For wireless headphones these last for quite some time, even when used for talking on the phone.  However... one of my buds has gone out and makes a static sounds when I use the ambient gm feature or if I run with it in.', \"I don't write reviews. Maybe I've written two in my life, and both have been because the product was SO BAD I felt compelled to warn others of my unfortunate experience. If a product works as advertised, I consider it living up to expectations, and not something to rave about. But the Air Pod Pro is different. I can't even describe the mind-blowing experience the first time I put them on. The sound quality is best described as superlative.  The noise cancellation is amazing. The ease of setup was easier than plug-n-play. It's as though they were pre-configured to work with my iphone, and amazingly once I had them set up with one of my Apple devices, it magically worked with all of the others. I could go on, but I think I've made my point. These are my second wireless ear buds. The first time I made the mistake of buying some cheap Chinese crap to save $75, but instead I WASTED $150. Lesson learned. Buy these and you will only be disappointed you didn't do it sooner. Full disclosure: I DO NOT own Apple stock.\", \"Bought these to replace my old standard AirPods which unfortunately got lost on a trail ride.  I have to say I was initially disappointed, I didn't think they sounded as good as my old ones, it was annoying to have to try out different earpieces (the old ones were one size) and I didn't think they sounded as good.  But as I have played around with them,  found a way to adjust the sound in my phone settings, and finally stumbled on the right earpiece fit, they are growing on me.  Sound is much better than before (I am a musician and very picky about sound).  They do have really good battery life and the wireless charging is pretty solid.\", 'So I got the AirPods Pro. The price is expensive because I’ve never bought headphones this expensive before in my life. But they are for sure one thing worth it. I could’ve save my marriage by having these things and putting on the noise canceling so I wouldn’t have to hear all the complaining and get upset. I would’ve been just like OK. So when I tell you these noise canceling headphones are amazing. Perfect gift for dads and husbands who just want peace and quiet. Transparency mode is good if you have the kids with you so you can somewhat hear your kids if they caused any trouble. But you still want to relax. The sound quality though when playing music is beautiful. I compare them to Bose headphones but nicer... Long story short if you like your sanity get them.', 'I work in a loud environment and have been using some cheap $30 ear buds. I’ve always wanted the air pods but also noise cancelling ones… I had always refused to pay too much for headphones. When I saw the new Amazon earbuds with noise cancelling I preordered them. Then, I saw these had gone down in price and I had a credit on my account so I ordered these instead since they way super cheap…. Well I’m glad I did. I cancelled my Amazon ones and have been extremely happy with these AirPods Pro. The way is cancels airplane noise is amazing, I can hear my own thoughts lol JUST GET THEM!! You won’t regret it', 'Can’t get these to stay in my ears without third party help (literally had one shoot out of my ear and across a table while just sitting and eating). Even with third party ear tips, or ear hooks, they aren’t perfect. Almost wish I had just ordered the original AirPods, but I like the touch features on these enough to not hassle with a return. And there’s no denying the sound quality is better. Battery life was better on originals too. Noise cancellation, even with transparency mode on still makes it sound/feel like your ears are clogged after a long flight when trying to listen for traffic when running/cycling. I went from constantly wearing the AirPods to only wearing the AirPod Pros when absolutely knowing I’d be using them. Kinda wish I had just stuck with what I knew instead of trying the “upgrade”.', 'So I caved in and purchased  them. I had a cheaper brand that was just ok. The AirPods have great sound and I love that. They are very easy on my ears, and the medium fit well. I love that I can check on my phone to make sure that it’s the right size in my ear. I have no problem talking on the phone and the person I’m talking to says the voice is coming across crystal clear. I like the noise cancellation, but I still think my Bose wireless headphones are the best at noise cancellation. Anyway, I still love them and I’m very happy that I purchased them.', \"Overall I love the headphones and I'm very happy with the purchase. I listen to them connected to my iPhone 95% of the time and while I'm no audiophile by any means they sound just about as good if not better than my other headphones by apple (Beats studio/Power Beats Pro). The main reason I love them is their size, they're very portable and I barely even notice them sitting in my pocket when I'm on the go. On top of that their noise cancellation completely blew me away, I was happy to hear (or not hear.. get it? noise canceling?) that they had this feature but didn't expect it to work this well. I work in a loud lab with fans blowing on multiple machines at once and with the noise canceling active I barely hear any of it. Of course I do have some issues that are relatively minor to me. The first is with the 5% of the time I'm not using them with my phone, I use them on my windows PC, and for some reason they sound like I'm listening to them through a face mask, I honestly prefer using my 10$ wired headphones on my computer than my airpods. I've also notice an odd ticking noise when I use them to take phone calls, it occurs once every few minutes and isn't too distracting but for 250$ this isn't something I would think would be a problem. I haven't noticed this however if I take calls through my windows PC, so it seems unique to my iPhone. Lastly I haven't been terribly impressed with the battery life. I get maybe ~3 hours at a time switching off between active noise canceling mode and the pass through mode, and maybe 12-14 hours with a fully charged case, but definitely not 24 hours like advertised. All in all the problems haven't had that large of an impact on my general use of the product, and definitely not enough to offset the things I love about these earbuds.\", 'I would have given this product 5 stars overall except for the fact that it includes a ridiculous charging cord.  The pods are expensive enough and if you want to use the included cord you will need to purchase a different power adapter.  Ridiculous!  If Apple is going to change the design of its charging cords at the very least the company can include the appropriate power adapter so you can use the cord.', 'I have extra small ears. The regular airpods fall out at the slightest movement. I was really hoping the airpod pros would stay in my ears. However, they slipped out whenever I moved or talked. Any movement of my face would send an airpod flying across the room. HOWEVER, I found a solution. I got extra small (aka small small) replacement eartips. These babies won\\'t budge now! I even wore them on my peloton with no issues. Here are the tips - \"AZLA SednaEarfit XELASTEC for Airpods Pro / 2 Pairs (Size SS)\" at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DTVXCZ3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1', '(Con)-comes with a usb c to lightning cord, but NO ADAPTER (which costs 30-50$ separately from apple) to plug into the outlet. So can only charge it with my iphone’s adapter. This cord it came with is useless to me since I have no macbook, but if you have a macbook u will see this cord as a positive + noise cancelation is pretty good sometimes. Drowned out vending machines, but not the fan-system at my job for some reason. So at least I can use them in the lunchroom, but not where I actually needed noise cancelation. +. Case is more comfortable than the last earbuds case i had - no case display of battery life - BIG negative is only 4 hr battery life while other earbuds are hitting eight and even eleven hours. There is no idle mode so as long as airpod pros are out of case they are losing a ot of juice. -  big negative for me, as I wanted to fall asleep with these on ; is that when the battery dies four hours into my sleep a very loud battery dead symbol sounds waking me up. Angering. Also my plan to wear one all day at work is now undoable. + quickest instant connection to phone. All other bluetooth headphines I’ve used have not connected quite so instantly every time I turn them on. +. Easy transition between canceling tansparent mode and the Hearing enhancemebt mode. Granted the hearibg enhancement is barely anything.  It would be more valuable if it was stronger. +. Siri interaction has proven positive however Alexa google et cetera are probably just as good.  So this is more of a neutral than a positive. Same with the looks of it.  Ninety percent of earbuds look good to me. - case could be flatter and more comfy in pocket + however it is more comfy than my last earbud case and mist earbud cases arw uncomfy in pocket. - price shouldn’t be mire than 150 for what this is. I’m thinking of gifting this to my sister, and buying the Cambridge 100$ ones or the Sennheiser $300 ones for myself. Maybe even thise 200$ sony ones because I have a positive impression of Sony from previous experience. But just 100 for the Cambridge with 9hr battery....or Sennheiser being the highest quality sound in an earbud. -  the fit isn’t great. Those old cheap earbuds I had made a more snug noise isolating/reducing fit. These in the size my iphone test told me is best keep coming slightly unplugged so outaide sounds can get in easily. -  though magnet case closure is nice, I will have to buy a button clasping cover for the case so that I can carry them on my keychains. 99% of the cover cases on amazon rely solely on the charge case’s magnetism to keep it closed, and my airpods have flown out more than once upon brushing up against things. I currently have a rubber band around the silicone cover case on my charge case on my key chain. -  i have found it after weeks of use, to be overall uncomfortable in my jeans’ pockets. Switched to a key chain case two days ago. +  after these weeks of use I have found the ios instantly putting a single headphone into mono mode (when wearing just one) to be time saving as with my non apple buds I had to go to settings search mono and activate mono every time i wanted to use one bud only, and then I had to repeat the process when i wanted to do both buds. -  i have seen my friend using samsung’s bugsby in the same ways I use siri without any lacking, and so I do not see the advantage of siri over bugsby alexis or cortana. My friend paid sixty dollars for a pair of earbuds and which have given him just as much satisfaction with less of the hiccups. +. However i will point out that this airpod pro charge case seems more durable than my friend’s case as his hinges on his case already broke. A lot of the cheaper buds appear to have weaker hinges in the cases conpared to my airpodpro case. However it does look thin and so I will be cautious with my hinges just in case it isn’t actually more durable. + i have rather enjoyed sitting outside with the transparency mode and hearing mode both activated as it creates an enjoyable effect in listening to the birds, wind, and cars passing by. -  I’m throwing in one more negative because of my overall feel of the price compared to what one would expect compared to all the options out there and also compared to the high expectations I had of a top line apple product. I would expect disappointments had I chosen the cheaper basic airpods, but the pro version of an apple product should’ve proven exemplary. I am considering dropping my rating to three stars as I feel like I am using an experimental prototype that was just thrown out here for beta testing of a sort. I might gift these to a relative and just get myself some cheaper ones like what my friend has since their sound quality seems to be just as good if not better, their battery life is literally twice as long, and their case is half the size.  I will not mention the name brand of his as there are plenty out there on Amazon, and I am just trying to give a complete and honest review; not trying to plug some other item. This was my first update of my review. I might do another update should I choose to just accept and keep these apPros for myself and not gift them to my sister.', 'So if you are like me and music, crisp, sounding music is important and you have been kicking the idea of Apple Airpod Pros, go for it. I never bought the true wireless AirPods because the ones that came with the phones were so uncomfortable. Last year I bought the Bose wireless. They had good bass but the left earbud would cut out and no noise cancellation. I’ve learned not to buy the first model of a product because the better version will be out later. So with the Apple Pros. Yes I used part of my stimulus check to buy headphones but I use them all the time.  Ut to the chase. Fit is great with option of ear tips. Noise cancellation is great, and all highs, mids, and low are awesome. Definitely recommend. Ps. The noise cancellation is so good, that I had to ask the wife, what(?) cause I couldn’t hear her like she has learned to tone me out. Lol. Gt', 'The two things that make these stand out for me are outgoing sound from the mic for phone calls and transparency mode. Both features are exceptional. The biggest drawback for me is tip retention when wearing them. To try to prevent them from falling off I have tried several aftermarket solutions without satisfaction including the $30 memory-foam tips. Based on reviews, however, I would say those of us that have this issue are in the minority so I would not let it discourage you from trying them out. Battery life is short compared to others but adapting to that is painless. When charge gets low I charge them one at a time while wearing the other. Since it only takes 5 minutes of charging for each one to get a decent charge this is not much or a drawback at all.', \"I purchased AppleCare+ for this pair of AirPods, and the AppleCare+ email said it's covered until Jul 2022, and the serial number did not match the AirPods that I was sent. So now that I need to make a claim on a damaged pair, 2 issues: 1. AppleCare+ does not match the serial number of my Airpods so I cannot make a claim 2. The AppleCare+ that did get registered to the other serial number, says the coverage has expired, even though I have an email saying coverage expires in Jul 2022, which is 2 years from when I purchased. I wouldn't buy through Amazon again, especially for AppleCare+ products, this is a big headache on an expensive item.\", 'I bought these Airpod Pros on April 30, 2020.  When I first got them I had some trouble getting them to charge, but finally got everything worked out.  I use them probably four or five hours a week at the gym and charge the case about once a week, They have never been wet, dropped or abused.  This morning 10/26/21 I pulled them out of the case for a walk and the right Airpod was crackling and hissing when I put it in my ear, I put in the left pod and after adjustments to my phone I got them to connect.  I wore them for about 10 minutes and the right pod crackled and hissed the entire time.  For the price I paid and the reputation and the other reviews I expected a lot more than 18 months.', \"The Airpods Pro are IMO definitely worth upgrading to from the original airpods. Using a seal the pro is able to produce much better lower frequencies. You also don't really feel the soreness or pressure some earbuds can cause. ANC and transparency mode really make them feel like they're in a completely different class. I'm not a fan of the lightning charging port, but they at least include a lightning to usb cable (not cheap) and wireless charging. My main concern is with the battery. 4.5 hours is more than enough for continuous play, and the fast charging is pretty incredible (3 hour recharge in 15 minutes). However 4.5 hours is one of the worst in its class, and doesn't leave much room for battery degredation. Relying on aggressive fast charging gives me serious concerns over the product's longevity. I wouldn't be surprised if these need replacing in 2-3 years. This is really the only reason I can't give them a 5 Competition (sony wf-1000xm3) There's not a lot of competition IMO, however the sony's really hold their own. The sony's are much larger and heavier, yet still somehow seem to maintain a very comfortable fit. The case on the sony's is enormous and certainly not pocketable. The sony's case does get a usb-c port, but is missing wireless charging. They don't have good waterproofing for exercising, and their size makes them a bit awkward for that anyways. That being said they're often as much as $50 cheaper than the airpod pros, but get 6 hours per charge, and sound equally good (if not better). Noise cancelling is probably slightly better on the sony's and the added bass is better for genres like hip hop or EDM. If you're only going to use them at the office (instead of for travel or exercising) I'd actually recommend the sony's. They're cheaper, sound better (to me) and don't have battery issues. Otherwise the airpod pros seem like the better all rounder\", 'These earbuds are the most uncomfortable buds I’ve ever put in my ears. Yes, sound quality was good and noise cancellation was good, but I ordered a different brand for less than half the price and the sound quality and noise cancellation are just as good AND they’re comfortable! These Apple AirPods are not worth the money!', 'The AirPods Pro are the AirPods to own. These handily outcompete the regular AirPods, and many other offerings.  If you’re within the Apple ecosystem the ability to, mostly, seamlessly hand off from device to device is a great value if you’re working from home like so many!  These have become invaluable for WFH life as well for things like noise cancellation when your kids are home.  The audio quality is good, for what they are, they don’t stack up against my over the ears, but I think they still sound pretty great. If you have an iDevice they also grant the ability to monitor sound levels in your ear canal, which is nice to alert you if you’ve got it turned up to loud and are hurting your ears. Spatial Audio is pretty mind blowing in video content, and with the addition of Dolby Atmos in Apple Music, it’s really well done in a select few songs. Transparency mode means I can wear these while doing certain tasks and still hear my child call my name, or the dog bark to let me know someone’s here! ANC is competent but Apple does seem to change the efficacy frequently with firmware updates, so notable if you’ve owned them since launch you’ll notice some firmwares are better than others. So I say if you’re on the fence and land on my review, get them, I would imagine there aren’t many steps up from here maybe the new Sony XM4s, but they’d be almost $80 more than these at time of purchase. They tend to work well with Android as I’ve paired them with a tablet I own for car troubleshooting and ANC and transparency are still functional while losing the other H1 features.', 'Sound is great with the noise cancellation feature. However they will not stay in my damn ears. I’ve tried everything. Adjusting the angle, pulling my ear back when I put them in, buying memory foam tips. They fall out when I’m sitting still at my desk, and exercise with them is impossible  Frustrating to spend $230 on a pair of headphones and they won’t stay in my ears. They also started crackling but Apple released a statement saying some were defective and they will replace them. But for everyone complaining about the charger. They made a new charging cable. BFD. They still work with the old charging cable just use that one my god.', 'As a product, they’re fantastic as far as battery, noise cancellation, quality and fit goes. However, I found it both funny and frustrating spending 20 minutes attempting to use it’s music controls by tapping and then finding out they changed it so you can’t tap them anymore, due to the fact that Apple did not include directions for the controls on the user guide that comes with it. A pretty big thing to leave off, but that’s modern tech companies for ya. Anyway, unless you don’t mind squeezing the stem of the pods instead of tapping them for music controls (which feels a lot worse than simply tapping), these are worth the buy, especially on a sale.', 'This was my first time to try any type of earpods. Since I tried this Apple pair, I have now tried two different versions by another company that are MUCH cheaper. Now that I can compare the pods, I have found that the cheaper version is not only just as good, they might even be better. I wasn’t impressed by the sound of the AirPods Pro. For me, I get better sound from the wired EarPods that came with my iPhone.…for free! I wound up sending these back and bought a much cheaper version from another company on Amazon. So for me, these Apple AirPods are overhyped.', 'I am very happily pleased with this purchase. I bought these to replace my Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless headphones. The noise cancellation is amazing. It works so well. The supplied ear tips make sure that these stay in my ears and don’t move around. The sound is less bass heavy than the Sennheiser but in a good way. It seamlessly transitions between my Apple devices. Highly recommended.', \"PROS: The transparency and noise cancelling options are nice and they sound great. Mic is great. CONS: These fell out of my ears 5 times on the first day of using them. And that's just sitting at a desk. Leaning forward to stand up - one popped out. They both tend to pop out whenever I smile. Also was using them to listen while editing video and then had to be charged before my work day was over. I love almost all of my Apple products but this product was very disappointing.\", \"I lost two pairs of AirPods in one week, because the case pops open easily. I read that the magnetic closure is good, but in my case, the case popped open easily when they are attached to my purse with a soft case. I contacted Apple Support, but was told by the agent that this same thing happened to him and he could relate to my frustration. I just bought the new Airpods two days ago after the first pair of AirPods were lost. But now this second pair both fell out of the case without my awareness. I don't understand why this product received such high reviews when the obvious flaws in the design of the case are not mentioned.\", 'Airpod Pros were great for about 4 months.  After some moderate use, the left airpod developed clicking and buzzing and became non-useable.  I understand that sometimes these things happen, however Apple support with the matter was a complete nightmare. After multiple phone calls to Apple support and more than 4 hours of my time, Apple is sending a \"DIY replacement\" left-ear airpod.  However, they are charging my credit card until I send them back my broken left-airpod.  So in the time of COVID, I have to make a trip to UPS and literally send back a freakin\\' ear bud to Apple!  I paid $250 for these, is there not some margin for an occasional replacement earbud for customers?!  Geez the greed of this company knows no bounds.  Just a really bad experience overall and as a long-time Apple customer I really hate the direction that the company has gone over the past few years...', 'These are by far my favorite earbuds I’ve ever used. I do not understand the noise cancelling technology in these little boogers, but I love it!!!!! 😍😍😍😍 there is an option for transparent listening and noice cancelling, and you can switch it back and forth with just an easy 3 second touch on the AirPods. I wish I would have purchased a long time ago. I use them the most while I am doing yard work and running equipment and it drowns out all of that nerve wrecking noise. The only downside is that I am greedy and would prefer a 8 hour battery life over the 3.5-4 hour. But over all I love them and highly recommend.', 'Good and comfortable fit in the ear with different sizes if needed. The noise cancellation is amazing. Just a quick hold of a button and toggle noise cancellation off/on. Smaller overall size than AirPods so harder to tell you are wearing them. Still have to use volume control on phone or via Siri. Battery life is good so far also. *They come with USB-C charging cord now and no plug in block. If you want to plug in wall you will need to order a block.', 'First of all....everything in our home is \\uf8ff. 3 mac pro, iMac, 4 iPads, 6 iPhones, and other AirPods. so that being said my wife did not ending up liking these for the simple reason of the silicone rubber that goes in the ear canal. only thing i can compare it too is when your swimming/shower and u get that suction noise/pressure in your ear. so we returned them and amazon was totally sympathetic to the situation. not everyone is gonna experience that suction/pressure in their ear and she is  completely happy with her older AirPods with zero suction.', 'We all know Apple makes great products but every now and again even the best of us have a miss. There’s nothing to complain about with these. They sound great look great all that HOWEVER as you may read across the internet they don’t fit most people’s ears smh. They fall out constantly but there are items on the market that you can retro fit to allow them to stay in your ears. Other than that they are great.', \"Seeing so many overwhelmingly positive reviews baffles me. For the accumulated amount of little and INCREDIBLY ANNOYING issues AirPods have, they sound be half this price. Every day with these headphones has been a test of my patience, and like an idiot, I didn't return them. Issues pairing, uncomfortable, constantly falling out of my ear with any sized earbit so i had to buy an ALSO UNCOMFORTABLE accessory that isn't compatible with the charging case, to make sure they don't fall out while doing dishes or, well, doing ANYTHING. Sometimes Siri just doesn't work. Sometimes the pairing just, Doesn't work. Sometimes only one airpod will charge, sometimes they will try to pick up a call while I'm not using them. I have to adjust them often, SHOVING them into my ear and when I do I'm likely to toggle play. Oh! Love it when I'm listening to an audiobook on one app, have Spotify open in the background, and when I want to pause one, the OTHER starts playing creating a never-ending cycle of noise. These dumb, expensive little jerks make me want to tear my skin off, fancy features ain't worth it. Do not buy airpods pro, I tell to anyone who will listen.\", 'So quality is great. The features are awesome. Love how you can turn off and on the noise cancellation. But unfortunatly they kept falling out of my ears when i looked down. Maybe i have weird ears. It does come with different tip sizes so you can change \"just the tip\", but the small was too small and didnt noise cancel great, medium fell out and large didnt fit at all. Guess i am sticking with my generation 1 airpods although the batterylife isnt the greatest on those anymore. Cheers big ears!', 'What I liked: 1.These headphones can be used wirelessly with just about any device at home 2. Convenient to be able to talk & listen without wires on the iphone max pro 12 Cons: 1.Being an eager audiophile -as I am-I know that at this price range one can start finding headphones with better sound quality-specifications and better noise cancellation. 2. I was expecting the plugs - at least one f the 3 sizes offered-to stay in my ears  during most bodily movements which has not been the case. Sometimes just when walking they seem to be about to slip from the ears, and eventually a couple of times they have slipped. I do not regret the purchase but did not meet expectations', 'If you’re comparing these with regular AirPods and are questioning whether the price difference is worth it, IT IS! Though the price difference is currently a bit steep... These are amazing, A MILLION TIMES BETTER than regular the AirPods which I found to be uncomfortable and kept falling out of my ears (the worst was at the gym or when doing any cardio). Noise cancellation is EXCELLENT and they allow you to switch it off when necessary. I gave 4 stars because as many mentioned, there is no adapter included. You’d think for the amount of money you’re dishing out, this would be included but apples gotta make money somehow now that they’ve run out of iPhone ideas I guess! So if you don’t have c to USB adapter or the latest Mac, you won’t be able to charge these out of the box, not cool. Kudos to amazon for getting these to me 2 days after ordering when the original delivery date was 2 weeks! Very happy.', 'These are great in all the ways you would expect. However, for expensive earphones they come up short. Sound quality is good, but not amazing. The connection between the phone and EarPods is not seamless. Often only one earpod will connect. Sometimes on an ongoing phone call they don’t connect at all. It can be very frustrating. Also, they fall out of my ears sometimes, especially when exercising. Lastly, I liked the tapping to skip, pause, etc. much better on the old EarPods than the squeezing on these. All in all, these are good, but have some issues.', 'Typical Apple elegance and high quality.  I have, however, not been able - despite a lot of trial and error - to get a satisfactory seal with my ear canal that stays in place while moving around.  This necessitates a jacket, which works to keep it from falling out of my ear, but not enough to keep a seal good enough that noise cancellation really works well.  Additionally I have to take the jacket off before charging. I actually prefer my Air Pods - especially since the noise cancellation is iffy on the Air Pods Pro.', 'Pretty convinced that the airpods are used and they sold me as new. Because the device name is \"Chen\\'s airpods pro\", which I haven\\'t figured out how to change it and nobody in my family\\'s name is Chen. It is very annoying to see other\\'s name while knowing it is my device even though I know I can change it. The noise cancellation is pretty good though. The battery only lasts for a few hours.', 'These have saved my life at work. Working in an office with some pretty loud people was my life, but when these came out that all changed. Obviously they’re not perfect. I can still hear noise around me when NC is on but with NC on and music playing at a decent volume, these things can really help you focus so much better. I’ve never owned a pair of noise cancelling earbuds but I can’t imagine another pair being THAT much greater than what these are. If you own an iPhone and enjoy listening to music, then these are a no brainer.', \"I love how effortlessly I can pop these in, without any hassle. I originally didn't like the fit of the ear buds. The smalls fell out when I laughed but the mediums felt too big after an hour, giving me an ear ache. If you're like me, try the smaller of the two sizes, then when you put them in, insert at an angle toward your mouth then twist a bit down toward your earlobe. It works so well that when I take them out the silicone often inverts over itself. One star down for battery life.

The \"Pro\" model looked like a reasonable replacement, so I went with it and I didn\\'t regret it – Apple somehow managed to improve on what I already considered great wireless earbuds – the connection is even more seamless now with automatic device switching, noise cancellation is surprisingly good, battery life is over the top, squeeze instead of tap makes much more sense and is easier to do. Even spatial audio is a great addition (even though I doubt its usefulness without MacBook or Apple TV support, but I guess it\\'s just a matter of time). So I would say, great job Apple!', \"I was really disappointed with this product. I've been using AirPods for 5 some odd years now (since a couple of months after their first release) and have used them almost every day since. However, when my 2s died I thought it was time to upgrade to a new pair and these Pros seemed like an upgrade. But not so much... Pros:  -Noise-canceling is pretty good so long as the silicon tips properly seal off your ears - the size is much nicer than the previous generations (the proportions of the tail are smaller and don't hang out as much) - Battery life is fantastic and the larger case allows for more charges - they look nice and the clipping system for the silicon tips is great, it really difficult for them to come off by accident -Pinch to Toggle is a much better way to have interactions with the product because you're not smashing the headphone into your eardrum like the previous 2. Not to mention that the haptic feedback and the cute little chirp noise are a great addition to convince the user that they did in fact press the button. Neutral: - The silicon tips will be a make or break for a lot of people, some people like them, some people hate them, I preferred the original tips but I like these ones more fore exercising because they have a stronger grip Cons: - AUDIO QUALITY: as soon as I started listening to music I realized how drastically different the sound profile is from all of the previous Airpods. (as someone who uses them to listen to music basically every day and has tried a variety of different headphones this is a very big point for me)   -Bass is super weak and sounds constrained as opposed to the previous Airpods which have a much   wider sound stage( par of this is the build of the new ones but it's surprising that they didn't do   anything to help boost it)   -Trebble is disgusting. If you turn the volume up to about 75% it honestly sounds like you're listening   to a tin can and the really high notes become annoyingly shrill. :(   I was so surprised when I heard the audio that I made an appointment at the apple store to test if they were faulty, AND THEY WERENT. I even got a second pair just to check. - Pinch to Toggle. I actually really like this feature except there is one really annoying flaw... If you pull an earbud out to listen to something around you and you hold onto it by the stem IT WILL STILL TOGGLE. Even worse if you are on a call with someone all it takes is for you to hold the stem for half a second to end the call. Almost every time I would call someone if I tried to pull one earbud out it would end the call... very annoying. :( I am returning these because I feel that the Cons outweigh the Pros hopefully this was helpful to someone....\", \"First, if you don't have a wireless charger you'll need to purchase one or a different charging cord because the one they include is absolutely useless. For this much money I find that completely ridiculous. And even with the wireless charging option these don't seem to completely charge ever. The noise canceling is great, but these things literally pop out of my ears. As in the become little projectiles. I've tried all the different sizes and none of them will stay. Also, the touch option has apparently stopped working. Frankly, these are terrible and a I wish I would have bought something else.\", 'By far the highest quality earphones and Apple product I have ever used. I thought my hearing went out when I put these in — the noise cancellation is around 80-90% complete. In a noisy gym it was nearly dead silent. The sound quality is fantastic, far better than even many headphones I’ve used. These AirPods stay in my ear when I’m literally upside down, pouring sweat, and moving fast. I have never used better earphones. Literally every other set of earphones I have purchased is a waste of money compared to these. Far superior to the original AirPods, and to every other product on the market that I’ve tried. An innovation in consumer electronics.', \"I don't buy into hype for things, but I had some bonus money and thought I would get some good ear buds. Holy crap, what a difference. The sound is crisp, the fit is comfortable, and the ease of using them with my Iphone is amazing. The noise cancelling feature is unbelievable. I can't hear anything outside of the buds. So worth the money.\", 'Love these AirPods. Had the same ones but been having problems with them. They didn’t wanna connect and the battery was really bad after a year.  I also had some charging problems. Got a chock the first time I used these AirPods. Waaay better than I expected. Wasn’t sure if it was worth to order from Amazon due to all reviews but I’m very happy I did!', \"The noise cancellation on these is mediocre. My partner bought these for me to block out loud voices at work so that I can study. It doesn't work. It does cancel noise a little, but not enough to justify the expense. This technology needs to improve. The battery life on these is pretty good, but they seem to have lost battery life over the time that I have had them. Lastly, the thing that I like the least about these is even though I tried different sized ear pieces they still fall out of my ears if I smile or make expressions with my face.\", 'I bought several expensive EarPods that were truly good enough..... except for the reality that these are better. Not massively better than my Jabra 75t model. But these are just the right thing to do with Apple. I have been with Apple products since the first classic computer.

But the concern that I would lose music quality and sound due to the abilities beyond just listening to tunes. But I can recommend others but my view is that the others were awesome. But these are epic and exactly what I knew I needed.', 'Can’t say enough about the Apple AirPod Pros. I ordered these because I wanted a good quality set of wireless air buds mostly for meetings on my laptop. I was told that there was a noise cancellation future, but didn’t realize the extent of what that meant. Once I put them in my ears, I was pleasantly surprised as it practically cancelled all the noise around me and Siri reads my text messages in my ear automatically. I didn’t know that this was all possible. I am very pleased with the purchase of this product and highly recommend it for those looking for quiet time in small spaces with multiple people, especially when working from home. It’s like you are in a room all by yourself.', 'Bought these for my wife and the experience was so good, heck, she bought me a pair. With noise cancellation on, my lips are moving and she can’t hear a word with me standing right next to her. Amazing. With transparency initiated the outer mic comes on and my voice is amplified so that she can hear me. Take one bud out of your ear and the music stops, put it back and the music starts...really cool. Sound Quality - depends on the device delivering the sound. Example...the base from my iPad (2017 13inch) is not as strong as with my iPhone 11. So The device matters. The buds receive and deliver great sound. With phone calls and conferencing, the quality impressed me. We love them.......but if I have any problems I’ll come back and update this review.', \"Overall, love’em! The spacial sound mode is amazing, like you’re in the room with the band. Transparency works great… so good I have to turn up the volume sometimes when the external noise is too much (does that turn up the external noise, too…?) Noise cancelling works better than the Bose and Beats headsets I’ve used. No weird pressure change. However, I wish it could cancel out more of the sound when there is loud external noise. Only complaints (I.e., needs improvement): 1. If you are in anything but the passive mode and you take out the earbud without putting it back in its case, it continues to drain the battery. They stop playing when you take them out of your ear, so why not have them go into sleep mode to preserve battery? 2. When you misplace them, the Find My app makes the pods play a sound, but if they are in the case, it is practically inaudible. The case should play a loud sound itself. Plus, Find My just takes a long time to connect, even when they are very close by. Overall, they're the superior product we expect from Apple. Hopefully, they’ll continue to improve on a good thing.\", \"So when these work, they work great.  Compact, low profile, great sound, very good noise cancellation for in-ear audio.  But the pairing.  My god, the pairing.  Supposed to be automatic and easy, but is not.  With an apple watch in particular, connection can drop for no reason, be hard to establish in the first place, can be lost if you take the airpod out for a few seconds...you get the idea.  Issue got worse, not better, with time.  My old Bose, while clunky and with a wire between that is annoying, works every. single. time. --3 stars seems generous, and I truly wish I could give more,  but if you can't consistently get an audio signal to an excellent product, it's sort of a total fail.\", 'I had really high hopes for these but sadly they just craped out on me right out of the gate as soon as i put them on they went into NC and before i even had any sound streaming through them they made that annoying deafening electricity sound then the POP... they do this RANDOMLY but constantly and it is so god aweful it makes my ears feel like they are bleeding... i have read this is a common and known issue with these and I wonder why has this not been addressed? I would give these a 5 star if it was not for that horrible sound step up your game Apple there are plenty of other headphones out there for half the price that offer just as good as sound quality with NC that wont make you want to choke a puppy :D', 'I got these through Amazon warehouse deals for a great price - almost brand new. If you’re waiting to pull the trigger on these, regular airpods, or an Apple Watch, don’t hesitate to go for the cheaper good quality rated items. The only blemishes are only on the packaging and the products themselves are perfectly fine Very happy with the sound quality and the ease of connection. However only complaint is that the left AirPod needs to be pushed in firmly into the case to ensure charging. I thought the left one was initially busted or was somehow getting interfered with but it was just weak contact - something to look out for. Good battery life and very fast recharging from the AirPod case', 'Like everyone has mentioned the comfort on these is decent, but not great. They do tend to sit in the ear a little funny and make you wonder if getting a good seal sometimes. Coming from Anker Soundcore Liberty I can say these sound a tremendous amount better with more features and functionality, but they were also 5x the price, so they should! I find the Ankers seem to be cut and dry on how they fit into your ear and no guess work on fitment compared to these. I have ordered Dakoni tips to see if this helps with fitment and comfort a little. Lastly the clickers on the stems are a little bit of a bear to deal with sometimes. They are not as fluid to get to all the time and not overly quick to respond. Maybe in time this will get easier', 'This is the best wireless earbuds in the world when I bought these they came a day late but when I tried the noise canceling mode it was like clear and sound wasn’t muffled it was just zoned out and the transparency mode is like your listening to the world without them in your ears but they are and you can still hear music fine 5 stars best AirPods better than generation 1  AirPods by FAR the battery life is amazing I just charge them for 20 minutes and their 80 percent changes on every thing and the sound quality is amazing the mic is extraordinary I tested them in calls and people told me that it sounded like I was right next to them I’ve had them for about 5 months and they still work like they do out of the box presentation is the best and I would buy a case because after a while the case gets small scratches but nothing big just a case is good to keep them looking how they did out of the box. 1000% the best you need these.', 'I really wanted to love these, and for the price I paid for them I should love them but honestly, I don’t. I’ve had them for less than a year now and the right AirPod chooses when it wants to charge and that doesn’t seem to be very often. You’re supposed to be able to just open the case with the AirPods inside and have the battery info show up on your screen, but that barely works either. When they work they work great, but they don’t seem to work as they should very often. If I could return them I would, but it’s too late now.', 'Well I can’t say there the best ear buds on the market just because it’s a apple product. What really bothers me is the bass. It’s very minimal it does not sound great. These are really great for audible, mids, and somewhat highs. Not sure the purpose of spatial audio going to improve the audio quality. I’m sure a true audiophile will know these buds are not the one. And yet  I still like them for many other things. It’s like that friend you know who acts there the best but you know that isn’t true but the end of the day there still your friend.', \"$250 for a pair of earphones is stupid, right? Well, yes, and no. The sound is great, nice bass, good sound reproduction, but yeah, I'm sure there are better for less. However, where this thing shines is in it's noise cancellation. IT IS SUPERB. It drops out nearly all ambient sound, loud noises, soft noises, refrigerator hums, pretty much everything. And it's integration with ios is, as far as I can tell, seamless. It pairs quickly and easily with your ios devices, and it integrates well with siri. I gave a pair to my girlfriend for xmas, and she asked me to help her set them up. I told her to put them next to her iphone and just open the airpod case. BOOM. Paired. Like magic. It's truly amazing what apple has achieved with these things. For me, they're worth just about every penny.  The only bad thing I can say is that the right unit failed after about a month. I went to the apple store, and, after troubleshooting for about 10 minutes, they gave me a new one.  Can't beat it.\", 'Truthfully I’m very disappointed with the pros. Been using them for phone calls for several months now. I’m averaging about two hours and 45 minutes sometimes three hours and 17 minutes.  I do enjoy Apple products however I would not go with the pros and maybe try the new threes or are reported to have a better battery life . Apple could’ve done a much better job it is starting to forces to look at other products  That work is there advertised. I’d probably give this a 1  Star . DC', 'I got what I paid for. These wireless earbuds are of great sound quality. Everything is very balanced and you can hear everything within any songs you may listen to. As someone who likes a decent amount of base, the balance is great and while it is, on paper, quieter than the mids and highs, I can still hear it perfectly fine and in a prominent fashion, all while not completely dominating the song (I’m talking to you raycon - take a hint). The soundstage isn’t really there, but since these are in-ears I’m frankly okay with that. You can only really get true soundstage from decent headphones, after all. Regardless, as in ear wireless earbuds go, these are a great product. The noise-cancellation and ergonomics are great, although they do tend to start to fall out after a while due to a combination of moisture and earwax, but using the large eartips helped make that less of a problem. These are far more comfortable than conventional earbuds and I wish more companies would make their ergonomics closer to what these use. The transparency mode takes some getting used to, but only because sometimes I find myself forgetting the earbuds are even in my ears, along with the fact that it’s not using the most sensitive microphones in the world, so your surroundings will be heard, but definitely a tad quieter than if you weren’t wearing these at all, so keep that in mind when considering these for use at work or anywhere else where you may need to hear your surroundings. The transparency mode only tends to cause issues when someone is calling out from farther away, where you may be able to recognize your name, but not much else due to the quieter sound being played into your ears. Either way, any complaints are minor and very insignificant for the most part, and I do believe these are worth the money. As someone who’s now tested it both with and without an iPhone (I recently switched from android after having the earbuds for a few weeks) I didn’t notice a significant difference in sound quality, so if you don’t care about the quality of life features, then you should be fine getting this to use with an android device. If you do care about the quality of life features then read the following: Many features such as enabling or disabling the noice cancellation/transparency completely or the special audio are lost, along with automatic pausing when you remove an earbud. There are apps to regain some of these features, the best one that I’ve found is called Assistant Trigger, but the features then get buggy and annoyingly unresponsive at times. I’ve found that the automatic pausing can mess with your music randomly pausing when using it on android. Otherwise, most features can be retained, albeit with lower quality. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for decent sounding and comfortable earbuds. These are of great value when you consider just how expensive that good in-ear monitors can cost (the best of the best can cost as much as $2000). Five stars all the way.', 'They stopped working. Just stopped. Stopped working just shy of the return widow. Go figure. And, yes, they are charged. Two days before my return window closed, I popped them off the charger and took them with me to the gym. They had been working fine until then and I had no reason to doubt they would at the time. Got to the gym and they would not stay on. The little light on the case would come on for a few, then disappear. I contacted the Apple store the next day because if I needed to return them, I wanted to do it before the window closed. Lo and behold, they started working again. I popped them off the charger to get the serial number and they were working perfectly. Had the agent in chat, too, though they were pretty clueless. I decided to keep them, thinking it was a fluke, and thought nothing more of it. Tonight, two days later, I head to the gym and, take a guess. Yup. They don’t even turn on. Nothing happens. No light. Nothing. And they’re charged, as far as I know because they’ve been on the charger. Wtf?!', 'Amazon shipped these to me & first set was stolen out of the box.  The Amazon box it came in was sealed so someone took them at Amazon.  Got a credit & bought them $10 cheaper at wallmart.  Not sure I like them in my ear as much.  They are smaller so hard for large hands to hang on to.  I wear gloves all day outside & I can’t tap these new ones.  You have to squeeze gently with finger tips.  My fingers are so big I have a hard time with them.  I’m thinking of going back to my old ones with decreased battery life.  Made for dainty fingers!🙁', 'Such a fantastic improvement over the regular AirPods. They fit and stay in your ears; the sound is 5 times better and the noise cancellation is like alien technology - can’t hear a thing (just a few noises get through). Battery life is twice as long as the regular AirPods, and the Spatial Sound (just added in last update is mind-blowing - it’s like surround sound)!! By far the BEST way to listen to your music or talk on your phone. Vastly improved connection to all of your devices (iPad, Apple TV - great for watching a late movie without disturbing anyone in the house). Just buy a pair! You know you want them - you ACTUALLY need them!!', 'They rarely work.  For every hour of play they disconnect 4-7 times. The noise cancellation consistently cuts in and out. If i move my head they cut out. Or i get a message saying, in order to use noise canceling, make sure earbuds are in both ears. Well, they are. And the seal is good. And they still cut out. Even now, it says noise cancellation is on, and i hear everything and everyone in the room plain as day. The range is horrible. Its so annoying to be at the gym, in my groove, and to have my music just stop, cut out, and then have to press play again on the phone. Ill never buy again. Just i excusable for the price.', 'The apple Air Pods Pro are the only earbuds I’ll ever wear. I’m normally an over-the-ear headphones person. But being that the air pods pro are so convenient I had to give them a try. The noise cancellation feature works surprisingly well but buyer beware. Ever since I started to use air pods I have been experiencing loss of hearing, constant ringing of the ears. Anything we do in today’s time is unhealthy. Nothing is good for you. I don’t wear or use them often as most people. I don’t like to tune out from my surroundings. But for how frequently I use them (which is very little) it is unfair that I’m experiencing these symptoms. Again I could just be getting old but This couldn’t be a coincidence. The battery life is fair. If you have the noise cancellation on it will use more battery life. Transparency mode allows you to hear your surroundings better. That feature also uses more battery than noise cancellation in my opinion. The Off mode acts like traditional earbuds without Transparency mode or Noise Cancellation mode. Which of course has more battery life than both of those features. Overall they’re great headphones. They’re super convenient. They work great if you have an Apple Watch too.', 'Complete garbage- way overpriced. Bose sound way better. After 2-3 months, the sound is distorted. I would say they are inferior to a good set of $40 skull candy buds. Shame on Apple producing crap like this. The first pair was defective and the new ones work much better but not worth the price.', \"This is the kind of thing I would never spend the money on myself for.  My kids bought them for me for my birthday and I love them.  I usually just buy a cheap pair of Bluetooth  wireless headphones and am good.  In fact I still have a couple of pairs of those floating around.  What really makes these better is the way they connect to my Iphone automatically when placed in your ear and the ability to either noise cancel or allow outside sound in. I'm not going to say there worth every penny because once I break or lose them I doubt I will replace.  Are they worth 6X the cost of my other headphones?  Absolutely not.  I they really good headphones?  Yes.\", \"I bought these after my 1st gen. Apple headphones finally stopped holding a charge. Overall I was happy with those though and had considered buying them again until I read the great reviews the Pro version had.  I'm really glad I did as the sound quality alone is amazing and the noise cancellation ability is incredibly effective.  I find myself using that part way more than I thought I would, if I need to focus more on work they're so helpful at blocking sound I often use them without even playing music.  When I do use them for listening to music I love how much bass and depth they have, the high frequencies are very crips and clear too.  Highly  recommended.\", 'At first I was hesitant to purchase AirPods Pro since I had the 2nd gen air pods. Now let me tell you, all the things you hate (at least I all the things I did) abojt the AirPods are resolved here The rubber ear buds keep them in you ear! So no issue with it falling if you’re jumping, running, or working out Noise cancellation is AMAZING! Sound quality of the music is beyond clear and you can hear everything Battery life can use some work, I’d say with general use I probably charge every 4-5 days. Wish it lasted longer', 'I feel like nobody mentions the fact that the microphones don’t pick up your voice very well, yet they magnify the sound of the background noise to whoever you’re speaking to. For example, if I’m talking on them in a quiet room there is no issue, the person on the other side hears me fine. If I decide to make a call while doing anything else, cooking, walking outside, anything, just standing in a slight breeze… the other person can not hear me due to the magnified background noise. No joke I was taking a walk and my friend complained of a horrible scratching noise, I was confused, but the man across the street was raking leaves and for some reason this was the focus of the mic. Never once had this problem with my beloved gen 1 AirPods. Yeah the noise blocking is cool and the sound is good but who cares when they constantly pop out of your ears, cause weird pressure differentials in your ear canals, and are generally uncomfortable. I should have returned them right away but didn’t. Loved my original AirPods, never had any of these issues! Gonna buy more of those, not these! That’s my review, take it or leave it…', 'Sound quality? AMAZING. Noise cancellation? What? I can’t hear you, at all. Battery life? Surprisingly better than described. I’ve never owned AirPods, but for an advance upgrade, I have to say that these are the best AirPods I’ve ever owned, ever. Or really, just anything in my ears to listen to music, talk or anything else in general. I also love the features that come with the AirPods. There are so many things I want to list as a first time owner for AirPods, and all I can say that’s worth every cent! Thanks!!!', 'I was SO excited to get these. From all the good reviews that I heard, they were supposed to be the best. I tried them with all of the silicone ear tips included. On the ear tip test, I would never get a good seal. I did some research and watched many videos and then decided to get the memory foam tips. While  they did do a better job of giving the AirPod pro a good seal, my right one would still pop out of my ear. I do a lot of phone calls and it was unacceptable to have them pop out in the middle of a conversation. It didn’t happen just once but almost every time I wore them. I even bought the hooks for over the top of the ear as well as the little wingtips for inside your ears. The sound was quite good, phone calls were clear and the ANC was good only with a good seal in your ear. So they were not a good fit for me and I returned them.', \"I hate these!! They won't stay in my ears, and my ears hurt from continuously pushing them back in. Of course, I dropped the case on the ground like 15 minutes after getting them, and scuffed it up, so I can't return it. I bought these, because it was supposed to eliminate noise behind you, and I work behind a giant paint oven with loud blowers (similar to the blowers at end of the car wash) and people on the other end still say it's too loud, and they can't hear me. Super disappointed! Feel like I tossed $235 in the wind. Needless to say, I'm angry. Horrible purchase!!!! My guess, is the people who like these are diehard apple people, because it's garbage. My MPOW headphones work better than these, and they were only $30.\", 'My new go-to headphones. I’ve owned the original AirPods and countless other wired, Bluetooth, and true wireless headphones. First, these are way more comfortable in my ears and I can wear them without (much) fatigue. Second, while these don’t sound the “best”...they’re only second to my custom in-ears (quads and dual drivers) and new Sony WH-1000XM3s. Third, I could definitely wear these for working out/jogging, though I probably won’t—too afraid of one falling out and stepping on it—even though they’re pretty secure. Finally, the noise-cancelling is awesome and I love how easy it is to enable transparency. The price is a bit more than I would’ve hoped ($199 seems better but the AirPods were already close to that), but these are well worth it and are a good intro into ANC headphones. Get ‘em. Do it.', 'I was skeptical about these. They are perfect for someone on zoom calls all day. Only downside is the battery life is somewhat short, but its nice the case charges them. The sound quality is very acceptable. The noise cancelling feature is a lot better than I thought. It really takes out quite a bit of noise considering its just an earbud. I have tried the small, medium, and large ear sizes, they all have slight issues staying in my ear if I get a little to active. I can clean and do things around the house with them and forget they are even in. I can go running with them but have to push them back into my ear occasionally but no worries. I like them.', 'It’s the real thing. I don’t know why some are saying it isn’t or why the got knockoffs but I’m a tech head and watched various videos and did my research and these are authentic. The noise cancellation is UNREAL but sometimes it activated on its own but I’m sure Apple will fix this later on even if it’s not that big of an issue SO FAR. Now the sound quality is pretty good I must say. The spatial audio feature that not many people know about is also amazing tbh. It made me live technology even more. They fit pretty well in my ears, I changed the gummies to the smaller ones so that it doesn’t slip out of my ear with the huge ones. The case is light and looks pretty nice, hopefully it doesn’t get dirty as easy as the old ones. Anyways, it’s a good buy. Worth every dollar, the connection speed is great and fluid which is important to me. I appreciate that it’s easy to set up and has great detection. Anyways, it’s great and I’d recommend to anyone and have already bragged about it to everyone in my house. Two people are getting them after I showed them how it works and it’s features. Hopefully this helped!', \"Super happy with this purchase so far, the active noise cancellation is pretty good and transparency mode is amazingly clear (similar or better to just having normal, non-sealing earbuds in). Honestly, these don't have the best audio quality I've ever heard, but I'm used to good-quality over-ear headphones. These don't really compare. Overall these are pretty comfortable for in-ear earbuds and feel secure. Even with the default silicon tips it's quite comfortable, almost as good as the foam tips that I've used in the past with other high-quality earbuds. However, they are a bit on the bulky side in-ear and if I don't get the angle quite right they press against the back of my ear and cause discomfort after a while. Still, really happy and would buy again. Not having to deal with wires is great.\", 'Sound quality fine, noise cancellation so-so, I couldn’t tell you about battery life. I ended up returning because they didn’t fit in my ears. Even with the smallest nibs I found myself trying to jam these back in my ears every 2-3 minutes. I wouldn’t do more than listen in my house for fear of dropping one on the street. I didn’t even wear them while doing dishes because one would definitely fall in the sink. I gave them a couple weeks to see if I could get used to it but all in all they just couldn’t work.', 'your escape lies within these headphones. from size to features, sound quality, and battery life...im more than pleased. i take long to make my major headphone decisions. i took some time to buy beat pros and couldn’t see why anyone would downgrade to these. man i was shocked. i caved and bought these when i didn’t hear any news of beat pro 2’s hittin the market anytime soon (Apr 2021). i had longer battery life in the beats but consistent use of one headphone at a time depleted the 9 hr battery life to 45 mins so i had to replace them. pro tip: don’t do that too often. The e s c a p e... immediately receiving them, i charged them fully and inserted them while searchin for the perfect track to sample. “ w h o a ! “ i couldn’t find a track before the noise canceling enabled itself. it’s a weird peace. no music. just a pressurized silence that can make you feel as if you were 100’ from the nearest person. u feel isolated. u never knew u needed this peace. & now, u wonder where you can slip into a mental timeout while your environment presents the perfect juxtaposition. i don’t even play music for the first 20-30 mins. i just think...while sitting in the backyard on a foggy morning. the clouds are low..and then the track starts; Erykah Badu’s other side of the game. the silence makes the music more sound, the instruments are elevated. i can’t hear myself snap or ppl call me. it’s absolutely blissful. listen responsibly', 'This is, of course, a great product from a great company. The sound quality is outstanding. The noise reduction is not terribly effective. You really need an over-the-hear headphone, like those from Bose, to achieve noise cancelation. It is better than no noise cancelation, but not much. Also, these are going to fall out of your ears. Guaranteed. If you lose them, that is a big financial hit. Consider getting a lanyard that connects to them and goes around your neck. I got one for ~$7 on Amazon. It has already kept me from losing the air pods.  I would not pay $200 for these. If they go on sale closer to $170, snap them up.', 'My daughter saved her money for months. I believe it was at least a year she saved just to get iPod AirPods. She says she has no regrets. She’s 14 and she was tired of using the uncomfortable ones that came with her iPhone 8. She says the AirPods are incredibly comfortable and do exactly what they say they can do. She says she is totally pleased and recommends them to everyone. She does say she wishes Apple wouldn’t charge so much for their items. I agree that they are overpriced. New products come out every year and within a couple of years it seems that new devices are needed because updates stop and the devices become outdated for use with certain apps and so on. I do love my apple devices for their security and privacy issues are way lower than any android.', \"The noise-canceling on these is ABSOLUTELY  amazing! When you put both AirPods in your ears, it's almost as if you've entered a spaceship. The noise around you is muted. Of course, you can adjust the noise cancellation settings to make it where you can hear your surroundings, but if you're looking for true noise cancelation in earbud form, I highly recommend these. I think they're worth their price tag. Battery life is pretty good, but I think the first-gen charged a bit faster. However, I'm not unsatisfied with the charger time on these.\", \"This is much lighter than Sony wh-1000xm3 although it does not have as good noise cancellation and sound quality. This is easier and more comfortable to wear than Bose Sportsound, my previous workout headphones. I haven't used airpods before so I can't compare in that regard. I'll definitely notice that my ears are blocked so I don't want to wear them for extended hours. They have officially 4-hour-ish listening time. But I never use them for that long continuously so it's not a problem for me. Overall, in terms of comfortability, weight, noise cancellation, Airpods pro are perfect.\", 'I expect more from Apple than some second rate headset. I picked these up at Target during prime day for the same price. The sound quality is “okay”, but I constantly fight with mic quality (people think I sound like a robot or been auto tuned) and just getting connected! Switching between the iPhone and Mac is a pain in the butt and the battery life should be longer than ~4 hours. The regular AirPods with worked much better, save your money and stick with those.', 'I bought these because of the interconnection features between Apple devices and I love them.  However there are two things I will gig them on.  When I call someone with Noise Cancellation on I can not hear what is around me but the person I called can hear everything around me just fine.  Also they did not stay in my ears well so I bought some foam ear tips and that seem to fix the issue  I love the transparency mode I have had the top end Bragi earbuds and some Bose earbuds and the transparency on these are game changing.  When transparency is on it is just like not having anything in your ear and allows me to keep them in more often.  There are many other features that are awesome as well but that is the highlights (text reading, button programming etc.).  The sound is very good but my Bragi and Bose I would rate slightly higher.  Bragi is out of business now so it might be hard for others to compare.', \"Previously, the only kind of in ear head phones that have been able to fit me without falling out were the standard apple head phones. I have struggled with every headphone with a tip I have ever used, they always fall out. I risked getting these over the 3rd gen AirPods because the on sale sale price was only 20 dollars more and had noise cancellation. I've only been using them for an hour since getting them out of the box so I'll probably have to update this at some point. I am using the small tips and they fit really well. I can shake my head pretty vigorously without them falling out. I am waiting to see how they handle working out until I give it a five star. The noise cancellation is pretty good for in ear head phones. I have the M4 Sony over the ear headphones which ultimately have better noise cancellation as in they pretty much delete the majority of sound around you when you turn them on even without music. However what I have noticed is that the AirPods Pro do seem to be better at removing higher pitched sounds (like my Roomba). I think I would have rather had the tapping feature rather than the squeezing feature to skip and pause songs, but I think that just takes getting used to. Ultimately I enjoy my Sony MX4s more, because over the ear head phones are more comfortable and have better sound quality and cancellation,  but I bought these because I am a medical student working in the hospitals, and wanted something more convenient to carry around and a lower chance of getting stolen. Ultimately I am happy with my purchase. Sound quality is great, the noise cancellation did exceed my expectations, and I am finally able to have in ear head phones with rubber tips that fit me (which has never been done before). I think if you have a choice between the Sony MX4s (personally best headphones I have ever used) and the AirPods Pro you should take a look at what purpose they're going to serve. If you're a student that primarily studies in a library and want exceptional noise cancellation, get the Sony's you won't be disappointed. If you work in busy areas or a med student that's rotating in hospitals and want headphones that you can conveniently pop in and out that you don't want to get stolen, then you should probably get the AirPods Pro you also won't be disappointed.\", 'I am not happy with this product and believe these may be fake. Major issues with keeping connection on iPhone 12. Can’t use them immediately and always having to redo connection way too much', 'This would of been a 5* review except that after less than 3 months they are not working.  We are starting the process of working with Apple Care and will likely get a store appointment sometime in the Spring of 2021.  In the meantime, they will go 6 months without them working....to keep eating up the warranty time. Apple has really gone down in terms of quality.  We also have a 2 year old Apple computer with sound issues...of course right after the warranty expired. Save your money, get a quality set of ear buds from any other company, I am sure Fisher Price makes a better set than Apple does. Steve Jobs is likely turning over in his grave for the crap that Apple is putting out today.', \"These are everything Apple said they were, but they died. The case would not charge at all, no matter what I did. Only 8 months after I bought them. Called Apple support. At first, they wanted to charge me $100 to replace the case. After 3 calls, I got a knowledgeable rep who realized they were still under warranty and began the repair process immediately with no charge. They sent the box for me to send them for repair, repaired them, and hash then back to me within less than a week. NOW I'm impressed. The noise cancelling feature is so nice; equally as nice is the transparent mode. I would say the main thing that made these worth the purchase price is the customer service.\", \"I wanted to love these, but they are just not well-designed. No matter which adjustable ear pad I use, they constantly fall out. They also amplify ambient noise to callers on the other side when noise cancellation is on. It's worse for them, not better (as I had hoped). Also, it's tedious trying to check the battery life on them and the features of answering calls doesn't always work, or adjusting the volume, and even activating/deactivating noise cancellation is inconsistent. Lastly, the phone is slow to recognize and show the case connection. It's so buggy and problematic. I can NOT recommend these AT ALL\", \"The original AirPods where much better quality. I've had these for just over four months. The left AirPod developed a strange buzz/vibration after a month of use. I took them in and they replaced the left one under warranty. Now the new one has developed the same buzz. It's like something is not solid inside. If I talk it vibrates/rattles. When I cycle it vibrates/buzzes non-stop. The right one has never had a problem. I'll take them in again to see if they'll replace it, but if it happens again I'm gong to see if I can just return them. I recommend you buy some other other brand if you're looking for noise cancelling buds. I love Apple products and have them all, but this one seems to have problems.\", 'I bought these to workout with and ride my loud motorcycle with. The noise cancellation is an amazing feature but after about the 3rd day there was a small cracking sound in my right ear pod. I chatted with Amazon and they had no problem with replacing them. I have had the new ones about a week and a half and now I’m experiencing the same cracking sound in my right EarPod. They were sold to me as new but I’m wondering if they are refurbished. I’m going to be sending these back and going for my third pair and see how those work.', 'These are awesome!....I mainly use them for the gym/ running and they are great headphones!  I am replacing a pair of over the ear beats which I’ve worn for years now. The noise cancellation in these is unreal...you can’t hear ANYTHING when these are on (note that you can turn the noise cancellation feature somewhat off)I was hesitant to buy these in regards to them falling out running, but they actually stay in compared to other ear buds which was the main deciding factor in me buying these. The sound quality is fantastic as well, I’d 100% recommend these and at least try them.', 'The sound is amazing. I love that I can use these for phone calls and the sound is so crystal clear. I had to take one star off because they absolutely kill my ears after about a half hour. I have very small ears and while the part that goes in your ear is soft, the rest of the AirPod is hard plastic and way too big for my ears. It creates pressure on the cartilage in my ear and becomes so painful after a short time that I have to remove them.  I often disconnect calls because I’m constantly trying to adjust them to stop the discomfort and apparently pressing somehow will end a call. So I guess it’s a love/hate kinda thing for me. But if you have big ears, you will love them. They are worth the price.', \"I've had my original set of AirPods for a few years now, so I was on the fence about upgrading...SO glad I finally did!  It's a major improvement!  The noise cancelling feature brings the surrounding noise to a barely noticeable level, so being on the phone, listening to music, or watching movies is a great escape from the chaos which is sometimes around me!  They also fit nicely into the little pocket of my pants, just like the old ones did, so I can easily have them everywhere!  The fit in my ear is also a way better and more comfortable!\", 'I use these every day and kick myself if I accidentally leave them at home. I prefer them to the handsfree functionality in my cars. I was a little worried about the case size when I upgraded from regular AirPods, but the case still fits in my jeans’ fifth pocket. Only two cons: - I miss the double tap functions from the regular AirPods. They were useful when I was wearing work gloves or had dirty hands. - The fit was not very tight in my ears and they would frequently fall out. I purchased some foam tips and silicon sleeves, which solved the problem nicely.', \"I have Anker buds, Taotronric Buds, MPOW M5.  All are OK with listening to music or Youtub.  But they suck with voice call.  I do not like Apple's Walled Garden platform, but their hardware design is impressive.  I am using them with Samsung S9 plus.  Paring is piece of cake.  After that, it takes 1 sec to connect after opening the case.  Audio is on par to other buds, but the range is excellent.  The best thing is voice call, it's way WAY way better than all of my current buds.  It's clear, and no noise.  I know it's' 234 bucks, not 60 bucks I paid for other buds, but they are worth it.  BTW, they work independently.  You only need 1 bud to talk.  I looked at Jabra 75T, Google Pixel bud 2 and Samsung Buds 2.  But I think these buds are better.  I still do not like Apple though.\", \"I'm pretty much an Apple fanboy.  Everyone in my household has iPhones, we have 3 Apple TVs, a couple of iPads and we all have Airpods.  So I'm not a hater.  These are my third Airpods, I had the first-gen, second and now these Pros.  Everything I've had with Apple just works, but sometimes these don't.  I'll put one in my ear so I can answer the phone and it shows connected on the phone, but the connection sound doesn't happen and no sound comes thru for either direction.  Swapping ears doesn't seem to fix it either.  There have been times I've had to use the phone the old fashioned way, by putting it up to my ear.  How embarrassing :).  Anyway, I love these but they do aggravate me when they act up like that.\", \"I bought these airpods pro as an upgrade to my gen 1 airpods, mainly to take advantage of the noise canceling feature for air travel.  I previously used a Bose QC35 headset but wanted something less bulky and without a headband.  Some things to be aware of: The airpods do not do as good a job of noise canceling the airplane drone vs the Bose, mostly because they don't surround your ear.  The batteries on the airpods will run out before a coast to coast flight completes.  Because they are bluetooth you will need a transmitter to send the signal from the plane's entertainment system.  All of these points can be addressed or expected, but if you are replacing a wired Bose headset they should be anticipated.  I will continue to use them going forward as I like the small carrying size, but now plan to recharge them  in the case whenever I get up to use the facilities on the plane to give the batteries a little bump.\", 'These are no-brainers for people who use headphones regularly and are in Apple\\'s walled garden. the H1 chip allows seamless integration, easy usage, and immediate connectivity. Battery life is good, while not all day like the Powerbeats Pro, the quick charge in the case gets the job done soon. The case is a bit larger (compared to the Airpods), but it\\'s still vastly smaller than the Powerbeats Pro and others on the market. The Noise Cancelling is unparalleled to headphones in this size category, but the \"transparency\" mode is very good as well. The sound quality is very mid-range. Considering these have tips and are ANC, I really would have preferred more base, but the reality is, this is the acceptable range for most people. Overall, this is a five star product because, while certain areas aren\\'t 100% the best, it hits so many areas so well.', 'I got my AirPods on Thursday and opened them up on Friday and when I first opened up the box and began using the AirPods both earbuds worked but in literally less than a minute the right earbud cut out and I hadnt been able to produce any sound from it since. I was so excited to receive my first Pair of AirPods just for them to not work is kind of disappointing. Honestly I wouldn’t be as mad as I am if I was like any normal person with two working ears, BUT IM LITERALLY DEAF IN MY LEFT EAR!!! I literally only needed one to work, the right one, so I could still kind of use them, but no, it had to be the left one. So now I have to wait until Sunday for a replacement pair to be sent in and I have to pay to get these AirPods returned. At the end of the day, or I guess the week, it should be fine. Hopefully the AirPods will work like they’re supposed to, and I will be refunded for return shipping costs, but if I knew it was gonna be this inconvenient I probably would’ve just bought them from Apple. I will update to let you guys know if second pair of AirPods works or not. Edit: second pair works great! A bit of a journey, buts it’s all good now', 'Noise cancellation works pretty well, not as great as my nose over the ear but decent enough to muffle surrounding sound. I do like the transparency feature as well, without having to take them out. They stay in place for casual wear and have stayed in place for light jogs, 3 miles tops, so far. However, if you do strength training with HIIT and Pilates after like me, you will be frustrated. During those workouts they fall out constantly, and will pause stop my music or workout class. Also, the battery doesn’t last as long for such a new product and I was disappointed that it only came with the cable and not the actual lightening plug. So I only got half a charger for the price I paid, which seems ridiculous since it has to share with my phone charger in the mean time. Interesting product, but I’d wait a few more years until they get it right.', 'I wanted to like these so much. I had the AirPod 2’s or whatever but always wanted the pros. Got them and good lord did they just flat out hurt my ears. I tried all the provided silicone buds and none worked to ease the pain. They sound amazing and all the modes are perfect but they’re useless if all you feel is inner ear pain from the headphones themself. Back to my old airpods.', \"The quality of the sound is fantastic . . . when they actually work.  After using for a week or so, eventually either the left or the right ear does not work.  Troubleshooting with Apple recommendations will sometimes solve the problem, but this is only after days of working on them.  Eventually, after resetting them, they stop connecting to my phone at all.  I have made several phone calls to Apple and ultimately have had to ship them back to Apple.  I have gone through that process twice already and am getting ready to ship them back a third time.  I could understand if I was using an old phone or one that is not compatible, but it is an iPhone 12.  And the AirPod Pros are not even a year old.  Customer service will not replace the ear pieces or the case, but require I either make an appointment to take them to an Apple store (the closest being about 1.5 hours away) or mail them back.  Because I don't have 4 hours to spare, I send them back.  Each time this happens, I am without useful earphones for at least 2 weeks.  And there are plenty of times I am unable to use them for days until I actually manage to get them to work on my own without losing connectivity to my phone entirely.  So the set I bought is a bad product, but customer service from Apple is horrible.\", 'I’ve used these for a month now and was not aware at the time of purchase of a long-standing problem that has affected AirPods from their introduction until today, a software problem that causes frequent pausing of media which Apple has never fixed.  It is quite frustrating and Apple support and the community have no dependable work-around solution. I’ve tried all of the suggestions and nothing is effective for more than a couple of minutes. I have no difficulty from this issue during calls where the quality is excellent and that is the only reason I have not returned the pods.  Internet searching reveals that this is a widespread old problem despite the premium price tag and the Apple brand.', 'I owned the Airpods Gen 1 and this model is definitely a step up. I appreciate the noise cancellation and how they converted the audio aid listening from Gen 1 and made it into \"Transparency mode\" Very helpful when the wife or kids are asking me any questions when I am working. I do like that the battery case can charge the airpods throughout the day, I do wish that the battery life lasted longer when using the noise cancellation but i\\'m sure thats the best they could do with the design. The battery case lid is a bit loose, I purchased an airpods case to protect the case from scratches and it helps with the lid. I definitely can\\'t go back to wired headphones as the freedom of movement is too enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone with an iPhone.', \"These were unresponsive from the start.  I was never able to get them to do anything.  After Amazon Tech Support tried, they sent me to Apple, who after an hour of trying things told me I had to update my iOS software.  I'm running 13.6, which all the Apple technical documents say should work just fine.  The Amazon Rep called me back to check on things and after finding that the pods still did not work after Apple's attempt, immediately sent me out a new pair to replace this non-working pair.  That pair paired to my phone (still with 13.6 iOS, as I never could get the latest iOS to download) IMMEDIATELY after opening the pods case.  Obviously there's a problem with the first pair of pods and I'm glad Amazon was willing to stand behind it's customer and make things right.\", 'I honestly wouldn’t recommend these suckers. Sure the transparency and active noice cancellation modes are cool, but they’ve got downhill in the month or so I’ve had these. -Sound Quality. Nothing to write home about, but not bad. -Left/right Sync. I listen to podcasts every day at work, and maybe two to three times a week the sound in each ear gets out of sync by a fraction of a second, just barely enough to give them an echo effect. Putting them back in the case for a few seconds and reconnecting them usually fixes it, but it’s annoying all the same. -The case. It isn’t great. First of all, it gets fairly dirty sitting in my pocket all day. Junk gets in all the tiny cracks and isn’t really easy to get out and the exterior gets smudged by who knows what. -I thought the idea of AirPods as a brand is the ease of connectivity to the phone. When I want to check the battery life of the pods/case, you hold it near the phone and open it and it gives your iPhone a pop up with the battery power. It takes at least 2 tries every time I want to check it. -The Fit. Another selling point of these was the customizable fit. I may just have oddly shaped ears, but the medium tips are too big and the small tips are too small. The smalls fit a little better, but I still have to nudge them back in every 20 minutes or so because they slowly slip out. -The Price. Holy crap, the price. I used my stimulus check (good old ‘rona) to splurge and invest in some of these, and it was NOT worth it. $100, I’d say go for it. Definitely not $200+ -Glitches. Last week, I hung up a phone call and when my music started to play again, it wasn’t exactly staticky, but it was cutting in and out a few times a second even though each side still had half battery. Returning them to the case for a second made it a little better, but I ended up just charging them to full and they were fine again. If you’re intent on having all apple products and don’t care about price, knock yourself out.', 'I got these after the new Pixel Buds proved to be absolute garbage and I ended up getting these on sale.  Like all Apple products IMO, they\\'re over priced, but glad I got them at the price I did.  I\\'m not a huge sound nerd or anything like that, just know they sound great for my primary function, which was for making calls.  Music sounds great to me as well.  I haven\\'t really had any issues with anyone having problems hearing me on them and no disconnect issues neither. I am however one of those people you see wearing these upside down.  They fit better in my ear that way and don\\'t fall out, whereas the \"proper\" way, they do.  Oh well though.  lol', '- Simple to set-up/use on Apple devices. - Wireless case charging is fast & convenient. - The case can charge the AirPods without being plugged in, allows for extending battery life. - Nice features like allowing you to hook up multiple earbuds to listen on a device (for movies). - Like the shorter stems, and the controls are intuitive with nice audio cues. - Audio sound and bass is really good (especially with noise cancellation activated), maybe not the best in market, but sounds great to my ears. - Great audio and mic capabilities for phone calls and video conferences. - Pretty comfortable for long periods of wearing in-ear, and nice to have 3 earbud size options to use (I found that I needed one regular size for my left ear and one large size for my right ear). - Expensive price, but worth the investment if you are using these everyday. Rumor has it that a new lite version is coming soon without the noise cancellation (which BTW, is one of my fav features after using these for a week). -Wish they came in black/gray, not a huge fan of the white color.', 'I liked these for a while.  They are fairly comfortable.  Noise cancellation doesn’t really work well.  But for that you really need over the ear headphones like Bose QC2’s.  The advantage of these is for taking calls.  For music they’re ok at best. My big problem came months later when I started taking them to the gym.  They do not stay well placed in your ears.  Every 10 seconds I’m adjusting them so they don’t fall out.  Tried different tips, no luck.  My $25 pair of junky Bluetooth earbuds stay better.  Pretty disappointed over all.', 'I got these for running because they were on sale and I’ve been looking at them for quite some time. So far they have met expectations. They don’t fall out, the only time I’ve ever had problems with them coming loose is either while eating (which every ear pod does that) or when doing mountain climbers because you are slightly inverted. The sound is great, the noise canceling works quite well unless you are in super loud areas (like next to a busy highway), Siri listens to me most of the time for commands, the force button is responsive. The one thing I wish you could do on them is change the volume with the force button, but I understand that you can only have one button do so many things. They last about four hours, as advertised, so it might be a little tight for a full marathon, but if you are able to carry the case with you, you can switch out the pod one at a time to get some charge in. The quick charge is great too, just after fifteen minutes they got over half charged. My friend has the regular AirPods instead of the pro and she wishes she just got the pro for the extra money. The different sizes worked out well, I have relatively small ears and the small works well for me.', 'Regular Apple AirPods or EarPods do not stay in my ears for a second. They just fall out. My ears don’t have a little “pocket” at the bottom, like a lot of people. I was hoping the new AirPods Pro would fit better. I found the sound quality and noise cancellation features to be fantastic, but I had difficulty with them “falling out” of my ears for no real reason. For a male, who spends time “standing over water”, this was a scary proposition. Bottom line: I had to return them. Previously, I had a pair of Jabra 65t earbuds, which are very good, but not as good as the new AirPods Pro. So, now that I can’t wear the AirPods Pro, I’m going to try the new Jabra Elite Active 75t earbuds. Features similar to the AirPods Pro. Since the 65t’s fit good, I’m hoping these will too...', 'These are not the best sounding earbuds I\\'ve had the privilege of using as I have some high-end IEMs but there VERY close. and they have VERY good active noise cancellation I\\'ve ever used. I have been in the passenger seat of a car going 85 mph and could barely hear the road at all. I have noticed there is a certain high pitch sound that it can not seem to cancel out but it\\'s very rare. If you can get past the \"Apple Tax\\' these are amazing. I would say they\\'re totally worth $200. but $250 is a bit of a stretch.', 'Wonderful product. I have some Bose QuietComforts for noise cancellation, and a number of “workout” headphones. I’m so happy that there is finally a product which combines both. The charging case ensure my Pros are always ready to go. I listen for several hours a day (audiobooks and some music), so a good set of headphones is highly valued to me. The ‘force sensor’ operation is tremendously simple to use. If you long press, you transition between noise cancellation and transparency modes, no more having to remove the bud to hear someone. My only complaint is the silicone tips. During a tough workout they can begin to slip (I have tried all 3 sizes). This is an annoyance, but not enough to lose a star. As more aftermarket accessories come on the market, I’m sure this problem will go away.', 'The AirPods Pro are definitely a solid pair of earbuds. The sound quality is solid. Not stellar, but solid. I love how easily they connect to my iPhone and my MacBook. Switching back and forth is seamless. The noise canceling is okay. Not great, but okay. I wish they had more passive noise isolation.  If they were just a set of earbuds I could give them at least four stars. Unfortunately I need earbuds I can use for making calls, and these earbuds are definitely not meant for that. I assume I got a defective pair because a lot of reviewers say these buds are great for calls. Whenever I make a call the person on the other end tells me they can hear the background noise louder than my voice. I am very disappointed. Phone calls are one of the things I primarily use my earbuds for, and I normally work in loud areas, so the terrible call quality is a huge minus for me. If you buy a pair and you care at all about call quality be sure to make some test calls and send them back if they don’t work. I hear some of them are okay…', \"The sound quality is not what I thought it would be from $250 (retail. paid $200). The bass is too low. You should be able to customize the levels. noise cancelling is cool, but I've also tried lower priced earphones from sony that worked just as well. Battery life is OK. I would like them to last more than 4 hours out of the box, knowing the battery life will only get worse over time. I also don't find the fit of either the small, medium or large earpieces to be comfortable. Large gives me a good snug fit, but easily fall out when i move my mouth or head.\", 'I switched from the larger previous generation AirPods.  All I can say is omg!  I love these!! Sound quality is awesome and when I fly (which is A LOT) I can even here the engines.  I flew from Alaska to Dallas and there was a small baby who screened the whole way. The only way I knew that baby was crying was every time that I’ve got to go to the bathroom and I took my headphones off it was still screaming I was so thankful to have the AirPods with the noise cancellation I didn’t hear a thing. I also own Bose noise canceling headphones but they’re big and they’re bulky, mash your hair down and are not comfortable to wear around your neck.  My battery life seems to last for quite a long time. I use them when I’m working out, on the phone or just to listen to music or podcasts at work. I have recommended them to all my family and friends.', \"I will start by saying that there are a lot of other products out there that do exactly the same thing and come in different colors. There are also similar products with a much lower price. HOWEVER, if you are embedded in the apple ecosystem there is no competition for the AirPods. They look and sounds great. Ear fitting if the key to long term use and being able to fully utilize the noise cancellation. Luckily, Apple care about their consumers and made a fitting program but into the AirPods. It helps make recommendation for ear tips and placement to make sure you are getting the full benefit of the product. I would buy again but hopefully I won't ever had to.\", 'These earbuds offer the absolute best sound quality i have ever experienced with  earbuds! I go thru several bud sets a year, so I’ve had many sets in comparison….Although I’ve deemed “”Airpod Pro” as the best overall experience, I would still like to try and review the “Bose” and “Beats Pro” earbuds sound quality and experience!!!! Don’t forget that the “AirPods Pro” offers LOSSLESS sound which offers unprecedented clarity and resolution….. Also, I must note that the stem of the Pro pods controls the experience from pause control , song skips, Siri and more!', 'Sound quality is decent, especially for phone calls. Music sound quality is average. Bass is just average. Noise cancellation is ok, but nothing like that on my Bose QC35ii’s. I can still hear people talking. It seems to do better with cancelling out machine noise, like fans. They hold a good charge for 3-4 hours, and charge up quick in the case. My biggest gripe is they constantly fall out of my ears. I’ve tried all 3 size tips, and the vibration from the speaker in them when using them seems to cause them to work their way out of my ear. Maybe some aftermarket tips would help.', 'I had the first gen AirPods and I bought the Pros because my first gen mic was unreliable (people on calls couldn’t hear me). I never had an issue w the first gen staying in my ear or fitting, but the Pros *will not stay in my ear!!!* I know what you’re thinking: have I tried the EarFit test? Yes. It’s BS. Have I tried all the different ear-adapters. Yes, none of them work. Now I understand this is not a problem across the board (some people have no issue with the pods staying in your ears) but the consensus seems to be that either they fit just fine, no problem, OR you will have persistent, relentless issues with keeping these pods in your ears and keeping them from literally lurching out of your ear, especially if you’re doing physical activity like running or yoga. I bought these pods so I could teach yoga. Sadly they have disappointed me and the problem is so bad I will return them. Here’s to hoping that they fit YOUR ears. Last note: the software on these babies is awesome! I love the integration with the iPhone and all of the little features like reading text messages, auto-connecting, siri, etc. I wish I could enjoy those features though.', \"I am a big fan of Bose but they do not have a wireless noise cancelling ear bud. I was excited to try this as i liked the second generation air buds. The noise cancellation works incredibly - just like bose. However, i've often had people say that they could not hear me well.  It could be because the end stem of the air pod pro is shorter than the previous generation and that is muffling my speech? For listening to music - its 5 star. but for talking...1 star\", \"Apple is known for fantastic service , but apparently that extends only to their phones. i shipped my air pods in for service 3 weeks ago and their online portal says it arrived the next day after shipping. There is yet to be another update. I have called 4 times to ask the progress and nobody knows when itll be done. NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING. and to add insult to injury they cant ship it back either. I am so disappointed in apple's service I just bought a JBL pair for half the price and double the sound. SPEND YOUT MONEY ON SOMETHING BETTER\", \"I am not an Apple guy outside of their headphones, where I really loved the earpods, the Airpods, and now the Airpod pros. I use these with my Windows laptop and android phone, and they sync and work very well. The fit is good, they stay in my ears even when I'm walking around. They sound about the same as the regular Airpods, but I think they look a lot better since the nub coming out the bottom isn't as long. The noise cancellation on these is the reason I made the jump, and I don't regret it at all. You put them in, and the world around you disappears which is nice for me since I hate outside noises. My one complaint is that the volume on these doesn't get very loud, but that is only a problem if I only have in one and it is noisy around me. With both in no complaints\", \"These were SO worth the money! I bought them to use on Zoom with my students. I also frequently use them so I can be hands-free on the phone, and I often use the noise-cancelling option by itself when I find myself becoming overwhelmed with loud noises in my environment. The noise-cancelling is very effective, the sound quality is good, and unlike many hands-free headsets, the microphone works well and it sounds perfectly clear to the person on the other end. Love these, they're a great little tool to have! And by the way, they are easy to pair with non-Apple products. I use them with my Lenovo Yoga laptop and with my Google Pixel phone and have never had a problem.\", \"These airpods are amazing! I typically only use one at a time because I was used to using a bluetooth earpiece. It works great for me that way. Paired instantly to my iPhone 11 and the noise cancellation works all too well. I find myself using them in transparency mode. There are 2 complaints for the product: 1.) You would think for over $200 Apple would include a charging base instead of just a cord and 2.) You can forget about being able to read anything in the instruction book if youre over the age of 30. The print is just too freakin small. Why not just send a card in the box with a website to go to for the information you need???? I do love the product even though after a month I'm still trying to figure ut how to best utilze them....but then again I am old:)\", 'I’m a skeptic on earbuds and always used Bluetooth behind the head earbuds. But these things are life changing. I have excellent sound quality, microphone works fine (haven’t had any issues on Zoom or Teams meetings) and super easy to pair. Only two gripes are that if you have them in the case and take them out, sometimes the computer doesn’t recognize them and you have to manually pair them. Also, battery life is not as great as I would like, but luckily they charge quickly. The noise canceling is great. I can be in the room with the door open while the kids are on their remote learning and can’t hear a thing.', 'First the good. They’re very comfortable to wear, and the battery life is quite good. I also enjoy having a transparency mode for when I’m walking. As you would expect, the noise cancellation is nothing like my Bose headphones, but it helps, and they’re much smaller. Unfortunately, my ears must be sensitive to the rubber because they do itch after a short while. I’ve mostly been using them for phone calls while I’ve been working from home, and they work great for that purpose, but I couldn’t wear them all day. Also, sometimes the left earbud stops working and I have to unpaired the AirPods from my phone and re-pair them. Overall, I’m still glad I bought them.', 'Absolutely love them. Yes, music is wonderful. I have high frequency hearing loss and these make watching TV a breeze (automatically connect to Samsung TV via Bluetooth). Sometimes when volume isn’t right on YouTube video, wearing these corrects audio. I purchased the memory foam tips because they help to stay in my ears better. Can’t wait to see new hearing aid function with iOS 14. These are already just as good as the Alta Neras I purchased four years ago. Even better with Bluetooth function.', \"Well, I thought I'd give these a try but they're just not compatible. I find it extremely ridiculous that a product like this would be designed NOT to work with all different types of handsets in 2020...  In order to update the earbuds you MUST have an iPhone to connect them to, and that kind of limitation isn't something I'm ok with. That said, iPhone users will LOVE these headphones.  Well, I mean, even if they were just apple branded bricks iPHone users would still love them....  I digress. The sound quality is great, noise cancelling is top notch, and the size / weight is perfect.\", 'These are great. They seem to work with everything I’ve tried.  Normally I don’t wear Apple earbuds because they’re a freaky shape and never fit my ears (maybe my ears are a freaky shape, who knows?).  So these fit like “normal” non-apple ear buds.  Can I just say the noise cancelling on them is outstanding. I can mow the grass and the mower is reduced to a quite hum in the background.  I can listen to audiobooks comfortably at normal volumes while I mow.  After using them for a few weeks now, I’d almost recommend them as ear protection for machinery even if they didn’t play audio too!  I use these everyday; for mowing; for focus time when I need to not be disturbed, when the kids are having a loud play session.  Outstanding, I bought the AppleCare plan too, because now I can’t imagine being without them. Bravo.', 'Received the AirPod pros and they worked for a few weeks and suddenly stopped connecting and when they would connect only one AirPod would work. Requested a replacement and received it very quickly before I even sent the defective pair back. So far so good. I like that Amazon doesn’t give you a hard time and tries to minimize the inconvenience. As far as the AirPod pros go they’re apple , apple products rarely disappoint and these are no exception.  I’ve owned countless apple products over the years and this was the first time I’ve ever had an issue. Sound quality beat the jabra elite 75 I was using previously in every way imaginable from fit to sound quality to comfort level. Great balance of base and mids. Most buds over do the base but the pros really got it right. With my jabra buds I always had to go into sound settings and adjust the eq depending on the type of music I was listening to. The AirPod pros always seem to find the right balance. These are the only buds I’ve ever owned that truly feel like you’re not wearing them.  Lightweight and the angle they insert into the ear ensures a secure fit. Once in your ears they stay there , you don’t feel them start to slip out and fatigue like other buds because of the design in weight distribution. My only complaint is the placement of the “buttons “ for play , ff, rew and pause.  They use the same tech they use for the MacBook track pad so while it feels like your pressing a button when you squeeze the stem there is actually no movement it’s just a haptic response when they’re powered on. As cool as that is I just preferred the tap gesture of the previous air pods. I do love that as soon as I put my AirPod in the media controls app opens in the background of my Apple Watch so I can quickly just tap my watch to choose the song or form, rewind play and pause as well as adjust the volume by turning the crown on my Apple Watch. This is one of the many reasons I stick with apple products , they work together in symphony in an extremely intuitive manner. I had previously owned a galaxy phone with a galaxy watch and while you could control music with the watch when using buds you had to actually tap on the watch and to get into that app. Apple does an apple thing and has it open automatically and not just open but hazes it out when you’re not using allowing the app to stay open but allow the always on display to go into its low power mode. It’s those little conveniences and attention to detail that keep apple users loyal and willing to spend a little extra. Lastly if he sound and fit test is incredible. It helped me pick the perfect tips for The buds to fit my ear with limiting sound loss. This feature isn’t exclusive to apple but it’s works much much better than others.  On my jabra and galaxy buds you constantly had to adjust how they sat in your ear to get the perfect seal and no sooner did you do that they would shift slightly in your ear with the most minimal facial movements. I can put in my AirPod pros , do the fit test and check half hour later and they’re still sealed in my ear. I couldn’t be happier with these earbuds and I can safely say my search for great sounding great fitting high quality ear buds is over.', 'Great sound and comfortable fit with the silicone ear pieces. I need these as the hard gen 2 is too big fir my ears. They stay in place and battery like goof enough for a long workout or doing outside work. Expense is always a problem. But that is what makes America great. There will always be people to buy your product. Fortunately it you wait awhile, price comes down and you can buy the antiquated model, which will still be new and works perfect. Gotta live it. Anyway, they are a great pair of listening devices.', 'I have had these AirPods for about a year and half now. When they are working they are amazing and I love them. But I would say right around a year (~9months) I had an issue with crackling in the left AirPod. It went away after a couple days so I didn’t think too much of it. I am not tech savvy and figured I did something to cause it. Well it continued to happen every so often so I looked into it and it’s a manufacturing defect and you can get a replacement if you have the warranty. Recommend getting the warranty, the AirPods are great and if I didn’t have to deal with the crackling in the left ear I would rate them a 5.', \"I bought them because I find the wires for regular headphones tend to get pulled by my clothing or hands while I exercise, and the price was excellent. I have found them to be much better than I expected, have a very good battery life (including the case) and, best of all, they integrate with my other products in ways I find very useful. For example, I can see the battery life on the earphones and case from my phone. I can use Siri to control the music on my phone. That's not a big deal when it's warm and I'm wearing short sleeves, but when it is cold and I have a jacket on that covers my Apple Watch, changing volume, pausing, and otherwise controlling playback is a breeze. I love them.\", 'Son Buenos porque tienen buena Calidad.de sonido,lo unico que no me gusto y no supero mis espectativas  fue que cuando llevan un rato en el oido.se caen solo.es como si el sudor lo hace  que se va saliendo.para mi seran bien carros pero no son como loa primeros audifonos que esos si no se salen  del oido  y se quedan mientras los llevas puestos.', 'This is a recent purchase, so I am hesitant to write a review.  In the one month that I have used the AirPods Pro, I am not convinced that the high cost is warranted. The main criticism is the lack of the base frequencies, and I do not feel that  the noise blocking feature works that well and certainly in not handling automobile traffic noise. The rubber tips work ok and the buds stay in place even in rapid head movement. I would like to see a detailed use instruction manual in Apple \"Books\" in addition to the small instruction pamphlet that comes in the box.', 'I bought these for my wife as a gift. She was using my old earlier version of airpods at the time. The first pair of airpod pros lasted just three months and never really worked very well. The better news is that Apple replaced them at no charge. For my wife they work well enough because she only listens to audible books and phone calls. She seldom listens to music. For me, I listen exclusively to music of all types. Their puny sound was unsatisfactory for me. I now have another pair of earbuds that make the Apples sound thin, artificial and tinny. Spend your money on something better.', 'I love everything about the Air Pods Pro. Except that they literally keep catching air by falling out of my ears.  The silicon tips work well at first but after a few weeks become useless. Last week I went back to using an old pair of over ear headphones because I got tired of searching the grass, bushes, car seat crevice etc. for an AirPod that suddenly decides it wants to fly away and be free.  Disappointed because I like the seamless integration with my phone and the excellent noise cancellation.  But Apple dropped the ball, ummm, AirPod on this one.  It is no more secure than my regular AirPods.  What a waste.', 'You can pick up a lot more sound from this device. You really hear every detail of a word being said while speaking to someone whom you work with. That matters, not to mention that it nails music compared to the normal ear buds that come with any iPhone. The noise cancelation is not as good as the corded, over head and ear, Bose noise canceling system. It is particularly bad at stopping music that is playing around you from being canceled. That is a bad software artifact, I would hope. I cannot imagine that being a hardware issue, so there is hope that this kind of thing can be fixed with an update, of some kind. If not, it is not a deal breaker. I can zero out everything around me in an average office environment. The battery of the carrier needs some work, its charging times are rather bad (it can take over a hour) to reach full capacity. I normally unplug and then after some use plug it back in  but this is a hassle that should not be. I do not understand why a new product would take longer than the recommended time of charging to reach full power.', 'Best set of earphones I’ve ever purchased. The noise cancellation on these are superb! Really drowns out the constant whining from the kid and incessant nagging of the wife. And when I do feel like talking to them, the transparency mode makes having mind numbing conversations easy! And at anytime, I can hold down the haptic button on either earpiece to drown them out again. Fellas, just remember to nod your head once in a while so she thinks you’re still listening. These things project the sounds right into your brain in a manner I’ve never experienced from a pair of ear buds. I was watching an action movie on my way home and had a fire truck blare it’s horn at me. Couldn’t even hear them for the 2 miles that they followed me afterwards. Highly recommend if you have the need to drown out all of the annoying sounds in your life! And they fit snug and secure. While watching my favorite sitcom, I fell down 2 flights of stairs and they stayed in my ears all the way down. Amazing product Apple!', 'These are super comfortable, and the integration with the iPhone is amazingly convenient. I marked sound quality and noise cancellation at 4 stars, but definitely see the overall experience as 5 stars. Recharging is super-quick, and controls are clear and logical. I was on a work call the other day when the maid started vacuuming. I put these on and the person on the other end said they didn\\'t even hear the vacuum anymore. Since I often drive with my top down, this containment versus background noise is a huge benefit. It\\'s also great to be able to say \"Siri, turn off music\", as sometimes my hands are full when someone walks up. There are just a lot of little things that make these awesome.', \"I think they sacrificed functionality for comfort, because although the silicone part that goes in your ears feels fine, it has no structure that keeps it in your ears so they fall out constantly, especially when you move your jaw. The noise cancellation is fine, but honestly not as good as the original airpods. I have had both, and the originals are a lot better. Also if you're buying new ones because the older ones don't produce sound as well anymore or one of them is losing its sound, that means the holes in them are clogged and I promise it is not broken unless you physically snapped them or something. Look up how to clean airpods using isopropyl alcohol and you can fix them I swear on God. Don't get these as a replacement to the old type these are not worth it.\", 'Not the last word in headphones probably but for the money they will do just fine. The bass could be better but then again, this is most likely the state of the art for EarPods. The technology will get better as we go but so far this is impressive for the money and size. I am sure some people will prefer a different “flavor “ but for me this is satisfying. Yes, I have listened to better, but they cost ten times more and weigh twenty time more.', 'I have Bose soundsport for a small sized earbud and Bose QC35 for noise cancelling. But once I got these airpods pro they became my go to earphone. The noise cancellation is great, maybe not as \"immersive\" as my QC35 but is good enough for blocking out some construction noise. The fit is super comfortable and much better than my Bose Soundsport. The only downside of Airpods pro is 1) after a long time of wearing, my ears feel itchy and slightly tired and 2) battery life is very short. Nevertheless I am recommending this to all my friends!', \"Well, for starters, this AirPods are good for talking on the cellphone. That's it. Don't buy them to listen to music, or anything that requires a top end ear-headphones, because they will be short at it. This are not close to entry level earphone in respect to noise cancelling or quality of sound. They're just not enough. If you're into serious music listening to, then you should try Shure, Bower and Wilkins or other brand. Apple is still lagged behind them all. It's a shame they charge so much for their lousy AirPods. Even Bose's in ear headphones are way better than the AirPods.\", \"I don't know if I have extremely small ears, but even with the smallest attachment, these fall out. I will say they have great sound and one even accidentally fell in the pool and it still works!!\", 'The noise cancellation works really well.  instead of tapping now you have to squeeze the posts, this is a bit of a pain as you sometimes fumble for the grip and if you hold too long it switches modes. not as comfortable either.  Used them to work out and when you sweat they have a tendency to fall out.  constantly pushing them back into your ears', 'The active noise cancellation can be life-changing when you work in an extremely noisy environment like I do. I’m a mechanic so my hands are always full and covered in grease so having a wireless, hands-free solution is critical and I’m happy to report that these pair beautiful with my iPhone. Fantastic for taking phone calls or listening to music/podcasts at work and the noise cancellation is very good at silencing background noise, although they can’t fully block out loud machinery. My only concern is how rugged these are because in a job like mine things tend to take abuse no matter how careful you are. The headphones themselves seem to be no worse for wear in the first month but the case is concerning me. It’s fallen out of my pocket and hit the concrete many times despite my best efforts and it doesn’t feel like something that can handle much. The lid is noticeably loose already. All in all it’s a great product that’s extremely useful for someone like me. I just want Apple to make a version with upgraded ruggedness like they did with the Apple Watch sport edition, also in a darker color because white does not look pretty after a day in the shop. 😂 For a product meant to be used all day and every day, nobody should have to worry about if it can hold up to longterm use. Especially considering the price and average sound quality compared to other wireless headphones available now. Don’t pull a Siri and stop innovating just because you got it out first Apple! Your competitors are already exceeding many of the features.', 'I had the original AirPods, but I didn’t want to spend the money on these when they first came out. Eventually, these went on sale and I saved up, so I finally bought them. The sound is great , but where they really shine is the noise cancellation. I can wear them at work and it feels like I’m home alone. I can enjoy my music without the office sounds ruining my listening pleasure. I recharge on my breaks, so the listening time is fine. The case is nice and slips right into my pocket. My only regret is I didn’t buy them sooner.', 'Really enjoyed these when they worked. Had to purchase memory foam tips for a good fit.  Would highly recommend doing such. About a mos ago the right ear becomes staticky and now doesn’t work at all. Have rebooted head set multiple times etc. My iPhone doesn’t even any longer c the headset in the box to give me battery life etc… Not what one would expect out of a 200$ plus investment in headphones. Such has been the case for many that have purchased … sad.', 'The sound quality is very good - natural, relatively accurate with a slight boost in midrange and good bass reproduction. Vocals are excellent. The noise cancellation works wonderfully, like listening in a quiet room, and drowns out most outside city noises. Transparency mode is effective - one can have a conversation without removing earbuds. The fit is subjective depending on one’s ear. Some people find it completely comfortable, others painful. One needs to experiment with different ear tips - I find large is best as it makes seal easier without inserting far in the ear. I found them uncomfortable at first, but am getting accustomed to them. Works great within Apple ecosystem, and the squeeze control works very well. In all - highly recommended by this audiophile.', 'I have an iPhone, I do professional software development on a Mac, I own an iPad Pro and the previous version of the AirPods, but let me say, this is a rare miss from Apple. None of the 3 sizes of tips could keep the AirPod Pros from slipping out of my ear, even when I was just sitting at my desk. Looking up the issue, I saw lots of suggestions of rigging the silicone tips with tape, which is not something you should have to do for $250 headphones. I’ll stick with the old AirPods without the tips or find something better for 1/3 the price.', 'I got these for Christmas last year and lost them in the snow in Bozeman a week later. I thought they were gone forever…Fast forward to 4 and a half months later…They were found in the driveway in the spring when the snow finally melted. They were frozen in the ice through negative temperatures for months. They were soaked, covered in mud, and ran over with cars for weeks in the spring before being found when the snow melted. When I finally got them back, I cleaned them, charged them up and THEY STILL WORK… very well in fact. They still sound incredible and all the features work perfectly. I’m mind blown. You’ve outdone yourself Apple.', 'I never review purchases. Why bother when there are hundreds of them? But I had to with these. Apple still has the same size tips for these as they have for the standard AirPods, which never fit in my ears. These were loose and always felt as if they would fall out of my ears, especially on a bumpy CTA bus ride (where I had to press them into my ears lest they come loose).  Yes, I was wearing them correctly.  The ear tips are the same size as the standard AirPods, and the fact that they were so loose prompted me to buy the Pros. I thought the tips would be improved upon, especially at that price point.  My loss, my sister’s gain.', \"I'm an Apple guy. The Airpods Pro were an upgrade from my Airpods, which, after a couple years of use, were having battery issues. Anyway, I got the Pros and LOVED them. Great noise cancellation, great sound, great fit and they worked well with Siri. But they only lasted LESS THAN A MONTH. I got up this morning to run, put them in and only the right ear made any noise. I repaired. Forgot the device and then repaired. Checked settings. Rebooted my iPhone. Nothing worked. The left ear was dead...after fewer than a dozen uses. Really, Apple? This is the kind of durability you get for $229 earbuds. I returned and got the Beats Pro and am hoping I'll have better luck.\", \"The airpod pro's are great in ear headphones. I was one of those people that just refused to buy them for a long time. I jumped deep in to the ecosystem from samsung in 2019 buying an iPad, apple watch and MacBook pro and finally a iPhone 12 Pro and i finally caved on the airpod pros as one does as they've invested thousands into apple tech. It is awesome once you have everything paired it will usually connect to whatever device i am using. The anc & transparency mode is pretty good the sound is loud enough for me, although i do see why some people think otherwise. The reason i knocked off a star is because of amazon, honestly i have learned the best place to buy apple products is directly from apple! This is the second product i bought from a third party that i have had an issue with apple care. When purchasing a product you have 60 days to add apple care, i attempted to do so about 5 weeks after purchasing the pods and was not allowed because the serial number found it was way past the 60 day mark to add. I don't really know how thats possible, perhaps they were returned from another customer messing up the 60 day time frame, anyway it was really disappointing not being able to insure my purchase.\", 'And what a difference. I really wanted the off brand headphones to work. I had them for like a whole year! I kept telling myself that the AirPods couldn’t be that much better. I was so wrong. The feel, the sound, the whole use of these AirPods is so much better. The noise cancelling is magical. The pods actually stay in my ears (the off brand ones would fall off if I yawned or did any other movement with my jaw) The sound on these is great, not to mention the mic feature that is also way better than those other headphones. I wish they made them in different colors.', 'After losing my first pair of AirPod pros, I was hesitant to buy a second pair. I did love them, but could I (a 32 year old woman) be trusted with them again?  I found these warehouse AirPod for $170 and decided to take a chance on them. I couldn’t be happier!  They came in the original box, and besides being a little dusty (which wiped right off), there were no problems. The original accessories were included, and everything was in the original box (with some Amazon stickers on it). The AirPods were charged to 100% out of the box and connected like a breeze to my laptop and phone.', \"Wife has the non-pro models and tried once. Not a big fan of those but these are so much better. Also have a pair of Bose SoundSport Free. Overall, the Bose has a better sound quality and is louder, this is at the expense of a much larger earbud that isn't near as discrete as the AirPods. For the size of the AirPod Pro, they do have a great sound and good volume, plus they are small enough that I can wear at work without being too distracting.\", \"I bought these AirPods because I really needed the noise cancellation at my house as I work from home. They were primarily a WFH buy. They fall off every time I talk, every time I eat, every time I laugh. I've tried all sizes that come with the Airpod and the only way they stay in is if I don't move at all. So it's SO ANNOYING because during meetings I'm always touching them and fixing them because they start falling off. Also, I'm not super impressed with the noise cancelling quality. My boyfriend has another pair of  non-apple earpods and they are too similar when it comes to noise cancellation for him to have paid less than half of the amount I paid for the Airpods. Summary: 1. They don't stay on my ears 2. The noise cancellation isn't that much better than other cheaper ear pods. Really disappointed because it was an investment I was hoping to love. I can't run with them, no exercise with them whatsoever either.... Agh. I'm so mad.\", 'Getting the usual flaw out of the way-The audio quality is just as average on the AirPods Pro as in their previous models. The noise-cancellation though is worth the premium, especially if these are your first AirPods purchase. Switching between Transparency and Noise Cancellation mode is simple, toggling between filtering out the drone of the commute and being able to have a conversation without the need to remove the buds. The main draw for any AirPods is the ease of use within the Apple ecosystem, and these continue to excel. Pairing is as effortless as ever, and the wireless charging makes the likelyhood of my forgetting to charge for the next day low as I just throw them on my table when I come home.', 'Within minutes of using these, I had to stop due to discomfort/ears popping from to pressure build up in the ears. One of the features of these headphones was advertised to mitigate the build up of ear pressure which doesn’t work. The active noise cancellation fails to reduce certain noises when activated, even with adequate ear fit. These AirPod Pros also operate with pressure sensors rather than physical buttons; the amount of pressure required to operate the sensor will move the Airpod if you aren’t holding it tightly from the other side, but holding it from the other side moves the headphone as well. The build quality of the headphones and charging case is very good, but for the price that is expected. Typically Apple is last to market with a product in exchange for a finer tuned product; this cannot be said for the AirPods Pro. Huge miss by Apple', 'Authentic Apple Air Pods Pros! Was able to buy Apple care on them! Great quality and worth every penny! I can’t believe I wasted money on off brand ones because they don’t compare! The Pros are so comfortable and I can wear them for hours without my ears ever getting sore! The transparency mode allows me to listen while I drive while still being able to hear all of my surroundings clearly!', 'I love these ear buds. While working from home more often, I found I was using my phone much more and was frustrated by always being tethered to my phone with corded ear buds. I had previously bought some “off-brand” wireless ear buds, but the volume was never loud enough, the sound quality was poor, and they were too large and painful in my ears. I also didn’t like Apple’s corded ear buds, as they were hard and hurt my ears, too. The Apple AirPods Pro solves the “comfort” problem, because they have soft, pliable covers over the ear bud. The sound quality is also great, and volume is plenty loud—I’m able to wear these while mowing the lawn and can hear just fine, even over the noise of the mower. They’re expensive, but worth it.', \"I have had the original and second generation AirPods and loved them, I bought a pair each for my husband and me as the batteries on the ones we had were not the best after almost two years. There is some getting used to with these as the controls are different, extra steps with the noise cancellation, and of course the different ear tips. The iPhone will guide you through picking the correct tip, though after a few weeks I’m going to see if I can play with a different size. The regular AirPods fit like a charm and are perfectly comfortable. The Pros leave a little discomfort, but I’m guessing, for now anyway, it’s because of the different shape that I’m not used to and I’m playing with them. The sound is very good. It’s a wireless set, so you’re not ever getting studio sound, but I loved the sound from the AirPods and the Pro takes it up a level. Depending on the environment you’re in (noise level, how aware you need to be to outside sounds like traffic) the noise cancellation can be on and block a majority of sound out, off which blocks a surprising amount out or transparency which allows you to hear what’s going on around you very well. Having said that because the sound is coming into your ears from the microphones it still is strange to speak with them in. I bought these a few days before the announcement of Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio coming to Apple Music. When I first used the Pros I tried some of the sample audio on the phone and it was pretty cool, but the new content from Apple Music wasn’t out yet. It is now, and wow! I expected some extreme change in how the music sounded. Something like the Maxell commercials sitting in a chair and the music pushing me backward. Because my expectation was so grand, I didn’t really notice at first. It was subtle, but only because I was listening for something else. Not all tracks are engineered the same, some are okay others will give you goosebumps, as if you’re hearing it for the first time. It’s not sound that is gimmicky, turning your head and the music direction changed. The music is all around you. You can feel it. The track that got me was “Here Comes the Sun, 2019 Remix” by The Beatles. Don’t let remix fool you, it's more a remaster. I have been a fan of The Beatles for a long time. Hearing this song with these headphones made me feel as if I was in the studio with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. But this is not about Apple Music but the AirPods Pro. I am in a noisy environment for work one day per week and have conference calls I need to attend. I can use the AirPods in noise cancellation mode and not only can I hear, but my colleagues can hear me with little to no background noise. Despite the smaller size the battery life to me seems even better than the originals, and with the case as a charger I can get them charged up quickly, but in my use I haven’t run out of juice yet. To be fair I do take breaks from music somewhat frequently so they are charging a little throughout the day. The case is a different design and the pods go into the case differently, but the size of the case feels the same as the original despite a different layout. I can slip the case in my pocket with no issues. With iOS 14, watchOS 7, and macOS Big Sur the switching between my phone, watch, and two laptops is seamless, and the only thing easier is the setup. Are there better wireless headphones out there? Maybe, I didn’t really look. I knew these would work with all of my devices. The AirPods were a big leap in sound and function from the EarPods that came with iPhones. The AirPods Pro are a big leap from the original. Now with Dolby Atmos/ Spatial Audio on Music, these give you a multifunctional headphone that produces quality sound and an entirely new way of experiencing music that has the potential to redefine how we experience music. These were a great purchase and for me, worth the additional cost.\", 'So I had the regular airpods before these. I upgraded because I thought they would be better but it’s not! The sound is 100% better but that’s about it, I find that these die faster than the regular airpods and I also find that they don’t stay put in your ear like the regular ones, they constantly fall out, I barely could get a work out in or move around without them falling out of my ear and yes I’ve tried every single size earbud that they provided and it still falls out of my ear!! It’s annoying! With the regular ones, I barely felt it in my ear and it never fell out, I jogged, cycled and did everything with them and it stayed put. Can’t say the same for the AirPods Pro.', \"I'm a convert from Samsung to Apple, and absolutely love the products. I like how they all interface together automatically. I was hesitant to spend this much money on ear buds, because I have small ear holes, and most don't fit. I didn't want to accidentally lose either of these, being wireless. These fit perfectly. These are awesome. Once you put them on, it feels like a vacuum containing the sound. The clarity is great. Highly recommend spending the money.\", 'The pods are just over a year old (so the warranty is expired). Out of that year they have roughly 6-8 months of use on them (bought them for wife, she never used them I went on a deployment came back and started using them). Within the past month the right pod has begun acting up. The speaker chatters when you walk or are riding in a vehicle on a bumpy road and if your on a call or have the noise cancelling on with a lot of background noise there is a horrendous amount of feedback that’s worse than fingernails on a chalkboard assaulting your ear. 10/10 would recommend buying Skull Candy noise canceling headphones if you want a product that will last only a year. 10/10 would not recommend buying these over priced and apparently low quality headphones. I’ve never used these for a physical event like running, never placed them in a rough situation that could cause damage. I only ever used them during low impact events like rocking a baby to sleep, listening to music while studying, riding in the backseat of a vehicle, etc. If the product lasted at least five years I’d say it was worth the buy. However, due to the fact they technically didn’t even last a year...I just feel ripped off and disappointed in Apple, to top it off I just got their new IPhone and the front camera has a green line running down it for some reason. At this point I’d just like to invite Apple to my funeral so they can let me down one last time.', 'These earbuds are incredibly useful and have a multitude of features that allow them to seamlessly integrate and improve your day to day life. As a carpet cleaner these were exactly what I was looking for: the noise cancelling drastically reduces the sound of the machines I work with while allowing me to listen to music or podcasts at a reasonable level (I haven’t found any ANC headphones that actually cut out the vacuum noise completely), there aren’t any cords to get caught on my machinery which would happen frequently when using EarPods, and they have a snug enough fit that the AirPods don’t fall out on their own while I’m working. There have been a few times where they have gotten sprayed indirectly with water and I have unintentionally dropped them in a puddle and had no issues with sound quality or functionality. I just made sure they were dry before I stuck them back in the charging case and had no I’ll effects at all. The battery life is fantastic and I’ve never run out of battery even on long 4+ hour jobs while using ANC the whole time. Plus the fast charge in the case helps provide enough playback time even when it’s just a short drive to the next job. Switching between ANC and transparency mode is incredibly easy for when I need to talk to a customer in the middle of a job, and often times I’ve found myself wearing them into stores if I’m shopping alone. I’m still able to listen to podcasts while hearing other shoppers around me, and Transparency mode makes it seem as if I’m not wearing the AirPods when me media is paused because it’s seamlessly using the exterior microphones to help me hear my surroundings. At home I love how easy it is to switch between my iPhone, MacBook, and Apple TV. Using the playback from the tv allows me to watch shows or movies even after my housemate goes to bed without waking her which is very helpful. On Apple TV you can just hold the play/pause button on the Siri Remote and a menu will pop up allowing you to select your AirPods as the audi I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a pair of high quality earbuds!', \"These airpods do a great job of cancelling ambient noise so you can enjoy your music or audiobooks. No noise cancellation eliminates all external sound but these are great when dining alone in a crowded restaurant or sitting in the mall while my wife shops. The battery life is very good and I love that the case recharges the airpods. They fit as comfortably as any pair I've ever used and I like the many useful features. The case slips into the watch pocket of your jeans. I'm very pleased with them.\", 'Don’t like them !! Watching so many advertising stuff about them , everyone are telling like they are so magical but NO , the are just super uncomfortable, like I can’t hold them in my ear more the 15-20 min , just AirPods for 120 are much better, and more comfortable than this one , if they will cost 120-150$ maybe I’ll buy and keep them but 250$ .. no thanks, too expensive for what they can give ! I returned them !!!', \"I have had mine since April 30th and I have no idea why people are saying they are bad or to big they give you different size things and Mine work perfect I cant hear anything with noise cancel and it's amazing I focus way better at school with music and when I need to focus I sneak them in and my teacher don't realize 10/10 for me because I'm a introvert. But anyways whoever had them before me took extremely good care of them cause they last 5 hours and sometimes longer for me which is insane I live in these now plus I got the cutest case at TjMaxx :)\", \"These are legit and you can get them cheaper and faster here than on Apple's website. If you have an iPhone or the old Airpods you need to get these. I think I actually like the Airpods more than my phone its self. They are absolutely amazing, the sound quality is impeccable and the noise canceling function works extremely well.\", 'I have never had any issues with Apple earbuds staying in my ears (as far back as the ones that came with the iPhone 3G). The original AirPods fit perfectly as well. However, the silicone tips (all 3 sizes) for the AirPods Pro seem more susceptible to becoming dislodged and falling out unexpectedly (even after consistently passing the \"Ear Tip Fit Test\" included in iOS and iPadOS). Thankfully, I\\'m lazy and have only used my AirPods at home and in the office (both of which are carpeted). In addition, the right AirPod Pro started making crackling/clicking noises randomly over the past couple weeks, but only when the Noise Cancellation or Transparency modes are turned on. I\\'m in the process of getting it replaced through Apple, but it\\'s certainly a hassle. The AirPods Pro sound great, but they don\\'t give me a lot of peace of mind considering their premium price tag and how poorly they fit my ears. The fact that my original AirPods are still going strong after years of owning them and the AirPods Pro are having issues after only several months is very telling. I have a feeling I\\'ll be screwed over when I have more problems following the end of my warranty, but I\\'ll cross my fingers.', 'The noise canceling is so good it’s scares me half the time. The first time I used them was so different. I couldn’t hear anything but the slight buzz of my fan 10 feet away. When I took them out though caused a small delay in sound feedback of my own ears! It was hilarious and took a tiny b it to get used too. The only reason I bought the pros are because of the size of my ears compared to the regular apple airpods and apple earbuds in general. When I got them I was disappointed. I thought that the size was to only size but to then look into my box to find the different sized heads was astonishing!!! They have the same variety of size as beats does! Knowing this makes this buy for me great because my problem with earbuds to begin with is the size.', 'I have used the original Apple ear buds for three years and wanted to upgrade to the new Pro model. I was expecting improvements but I was amazed at the level of clarity and especially the noise cancellation feature. I use them with my iPhone, iPad and recently I have paired them with a smart TV and now can watch a movie with the mose incredible sound imaginable. Better than a theater. Also, these last over four hours per charge unlike the originals which only lasted about ninety minutes.', 'I love everything about my Air Pods Pro and you will too. I have used Jaybirds for the last 5-6 years -- and the AirPods Pro blow them out of the water with superior sound cancellation technology, and much better support for phone calls. Bottom line -- regardless of what you do for work -- or for working out! -- these earphones will improve your quality of life. It is imperative that you go with the Pro model for sound cancellation that truly works and gives you control over your music and your environment. These are the best earphones -- the only decision you really have left to make is whether you can wait for the next version to be released!', 'I don\\'t know why people are saying they are fake. These aren\\'t.  They connected to my phone immediately and they show up in the \"find my\" app.  I LOVE them!  This is the first set of wireless buds that stay in my ear.  I like to be able to switch between noise cancelling and transparency mode.  The first time I put them in with noise cancelling mode on, I thought the electricity went off.  I could not hear anything!  My favorite feature is the \"spatial sound\" feature.  The first time I watched a movie with them on, I kept getting startled by voices behind me, or doors closing over to my right or left.  And the sound adjusts as I move so it sounds like it would if I were actually walking around in the room where the movies was happening.  They charge from my iPhone wireless charging pad, and if I get it just right, they also charge from my Apple Watch charger.  Another issue I have had with wireless buds is, when they have a good seal, and you are walking, you can hear each footstep.  I don\\'t find that to be a problem with these.  I am very happy with my purchase!', 'About a month ago I bought AirPod pros (used very good) from here but I lost them a couple weeks later. They worked fine so I bought another pair but one of the AirPods wouldn’t connect. I had to go through troubleshooting with Apple for a couple days instead of just being told to return. I returned and then bought new ones but this time they either were stolen by Amazon transit workers or the item was left out the box. I had to wait two weeks to hear back from a case I never did hear back from. I finally got a refund and bought the AirPods one last time. Fortunately they worked just as fine as the first. Moral of story, If the product was thoroughly tested the second time, I wouldn’t have had to wait a month to get another solid pair.', 'I’m only giving it 3 stars because there is not a single wireless headphones that I can use and not get a headache after waking up from sleep. So I gave up on the concept of having wireless microwave substance like objects on my head producing cancer in the long run, Other wise the sound quality blows every competition out of the water. Good job Apple you were so very close all you needed was a lightning cable attached to the AirPods Pro and boom no more cancer or headaches.', 'I purchased the apple Airpods Pro in an effort to replace a Bose noise cancelling ear bud. I was not impressed with the Bose due to bad connections poor ear fitment and terrible battery life. Within the first day of using the Pods Pro I Immediately noticed a difference in all 3 of those categories. On the Airpods the battery life is excellent, multiple movies were watched and the life was still more than 50% The noise cancelling is also very very good Probably one of the best features of the Airpods is there are multiple ear pieces offered too fit different ear sizes, and after hours of wearing the earbuds my ears DID NOT ache like they did with other headphones. Over all a very good product and would highly recommend!', 'I read and did a lot of research prior to ordering. I was so nervous to unbox the AirPods because of all the speculation around them being fake from Amazon. Happy to tell you all, they’re real. At least mine are. I looked up the serial number on the box on the apple “check your service and support coverage” page and they are 100% authentic (Amazon is also an authorized reseller of Apple products). I even dug deeper and looked at an article on how to spot fake and real AirPods. The ones I got from Amazon ticked all the boxes of authentic pods. The noise cancellation is pretty cool. It blocks out light noises like a fan or air conditioner. It doesn’t completely shut out loud talking or a lawn mower for example. I’m not a huge audiophile but I can say the bass is just ok. It doesn’t sound much different than my wired Bluetooth Sony headphones but they’re still really good. Sound quality overall though is great. Transparency mode is also really cool. You can hear everything around you and have normal conversations while still being able to listen to music. Talking on the phone is also really easy and sounds natural. The coolest part for me though is that they conform to your ears and they have vents to relieve pressure so they’re more comfortable. And they do not fall out of my ears. Ever. I have quite small, waxy ears and every other pair of earbuds I’ve ever owned (which has been a lot) have always fallen out of my ears. Chewing, walking, turning my head, even staying still they’d fall out. These don’t. They’re bomb lol. Battery life is ok too. Could be a lot better. They connect so fast to my phone and as soon as you open the lid, the charge percentage shows up (and they charge really fast) but you have to have the pods in the case to be able to see exactly how much charge is left in the case and both buds. After all is said and done though, I love these. They’re the coolest, most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever had. They’re pretty pricey but in my opinion, worth it. Go get you some AirPod Pros!! You won’t regret it', \"This product has three different sizes of ear plugs, which are comfortable.  However the housing size remains the same and does not adjust to smaller ears.  This means small-eared people have a comfortable plug and an uncomfortable body crammed into the outer ear.  They cannot be worn for over a few hours.  It is like wearing a pair of shoes one size too small.  I place it loosely in my ear, which helps.  It has only fallen out once.  As a product, it's amazing, which is the reason I did not return it.  Nobody has complained about the microphone.  It is intuitive.  It feels like the future is here.\", 'These AirPods gave off the most toxic, nauseating fumes out of the box. I googled to see if this was an issue and saw that some people said their AirPods Pro smelled like blueberries. A berry fragrance would have been fine but this was not it. I got a terrible headache from the odor when I tried on the AirPods. I even suspected it might have been counterfeit but I checked, and they appear to be legit. It functioned fine. I would have returned them but my husband was fine with the smell.', 'It’s been about a month since I first got them and as expected build quality was excellent as most Apple products are. They fit perfectly out of the box with the medium sized earpieces. As far as sound it depends on what particular sound your listening to. Some songs sound flat while most sound great so I’m assuming it’s how the sound engineers originally recorded their songs. High end frequencies like cymbals are somewhat muted as is deep base but not to the point of sounding cheap. The noise reduction works well when your around somewhat reduced ambient noise like the wind blowing outside but it’s not quite as effective as Bose Comfort 35’s but then they are earbuds and not full coverage headphones. Overall I’m pleased with their performance.', 'The sound quality is superb, noise cancellation is excellent.  However, you have to realize it’s a crap shoot whether they will fit your ears properly.  Although they come with three different sizes of silicone ear pieces, they have a tendency to fall out of my ears no matter what size ear pieces I use.  This is a result of the stem being to short to properly seat in the ear canal.  There is no way I can wear these things while conducting any physical activity.  Even walking around the block will require me pushing them back into my ear several times.  So basically, I’m restricted to using them while sitting still on the couch.  Although the quality and technical features that make their use with multiple Apple devices a pleasure, it’s a heavy price to pay considering the limited use I can get out of them.', 'After 6 months the right earbud has a crackling sound at higher volumes or frequencies. Disappointed at the fact that it is an Apple product and it requires maintenance/replacement. I haven’t bothered with going to the Apple store to get it fix or replaced. There are a lot better and less expensive earbuds around the price of replacing right earbud only. These have good sound quality when they are working perfectly. I only use the left earbud for phone calls or a back up.', 'Yes I am an apple a holic. I owned these and one was lost. I decided to buy them again and will be extra careful. Like all bluetooth products they take a day or two to perfectly sync. However I did not really have that issue with these and the sound is amazing and I love the ease of syncing instead of the non apple bluetooth products. Yes they are also a status symbol. love them -brand new in box and in plastic and with everything, charger and charging wire', 'These are absolutely the worst ear buds I’ve ever owned in my life! It doesn’t matter how good they sound or how long the battery lasts if they don’t stay in your ears. No matter which ear tips I use, they absolutely will not stay put. They fall out about every couple minutes if I’m eating, they fall out every 10-15 minutes if I’m walking, and even fall out when I’m standing still. They seem to be water-resistant because they’ve fallen out in my food, in a drink, and other places I shall not mention. I highly recommend you stay away from these as they are just awful. I missed the return window so I’m stuck with these pieces of junk until someone makes aftermarket ear tips that fit them.', \"The good: Integration with your iPhone and Apple Watch is very easy.  Handoff between your airpods and carplay is decent.  Battery life the shining point. The mediocre: Sound quality is average at best.  Nothing to write home about but nothing terrible either. The bad: Active Noise Cancellation - this really only works for constant noises that don't change much, like an office fan, or other HVAC system.  Sporadic sound impulses are still audible even with ANC on. Fit - this is the biggest let down.  In my late 30's I am suddenly regressing in our evolutionary change and becoming more beastly.  Apple chose to make the ear tips silicon or rubber.  With these two combining factors the earpods fall from my ears, regardless of which tip size I use, with very little movement.\", 'Edited: replacements work great. Got mine in yesterday and was so excited. The AirPods came charged so I used them right away. When I was done for the night, I put them on the charger in their case. It said AirPods-50% and Case-100%. This morning, I’ve tried multiple cables and the light doesn’t come on at all. Won’t pair. Won’t work. Reset does nothing. Super disappointed and I will update when my replacement comes in. Says it will be a WEEK 😩 Nothing positive to say right now besides I enjoyed the sound the couple hours they worked. (Did make my ears tender though)', \"Now I get why all the fuss about these earphones... They are... something else... Now I get all the fuss over the web. After using AirPods 2 for almost a year I thought there wouldn't be much a difference between the 2 but I am totally amazed by the noise canceling and ambient feature!!! I never noticed how much noise my office's AC makes! Maybe in a couple of years all earphones will have such amazing features but right now... nothing comes close.\", \"I've been using blue tooth devices since they became available. I've always purchased inexpensive models but biz has been pretty good so I decided to splurge and see how these worked. Wow, am I happy I did. The best part is how easy they connect to my different devices whether I am getting into my car and they seamlessly switch to carplay, or if I want to leave my phone at home and connect to my iWatch. I could go on and on but my time is valuable and I'm not getting paid for this. They are awesome. Enough said.\", 'You will not regret getting these. The noise cancellation is awesome. There is even a slight noise cancellation when you turn everything off. They have an ear tip fit test to make sure you are using the correct ear tip on the AirPods. It does come with 3. You can also use a transparency mode to let some background noise in. The sound quality is amazing, and you can use on multiple devices. I even let someone else use mine on their device. The charge holds long time. And they charge super fast too. When you take the out of the case you see on screen how much battery is left on case and on airpods. Must have these. Worth the price for real!', 'I bought these to replace my original airpod 2.0.  I had high hopes for these.  In the end, I would stick with the 2.0s or original airpods.  They do not stay in your ear no matter what you try to do.  If you walk they fall out.  If you talk they fall out.  If you exercise they fall out.  I had to buy an accessory from a supplier to make sure that they fit.  I would stay away from these until Apple fixes what seems like a common problem.', 'These are ok. I’ll need to get the foam tips because none of the silicon really work in my right ear (some small cauliflower from wrestling in my youth). I wish the magnets in the case were a little stronger, sometimes it doesn’t recognize one is the case and it won’t charge it until I wiggle it. I hope the sound quality improves with the foam tips. But the ANC is nice. Transparency is odd at first, but it’s good for when it’s needed. If they improve the battery in Gen 2 then they could have a winner.', 'To compliment my iPhone, I purchased the Airpods pro.  They seemed well built and the sound quality in excellent.  Trying to find a strong carry case was a challenge..  The quality was short lived as there was a  crackling sound on the right ear piece.  After dealing with Apple support and being away due to COVID, I had no choice but to look for a new ear piece.  The Airpods did not last a year, I am one who takes good care of my devices. Very disappointed.  Those Airpods are not cheep so there is the expectation of QUALITY!!!', \"I decided to make the switch to the AirPod pros after I lost my first-gen AirPods. I was skeptical reading the reviews but went with it anyway. I'm not super tech savvy, but here are a couple of changes I've noticed! Likes: -Ahhh, the tips. The thing I was most afraid of. I was initially really uncomfortable with them (the medium default size), but I'm really glad that they have adjustable sizing. I switched to the small and they fit in my ears very comfortably and securely. I recommend you do switch the sizes first and have a tool like a credit card or tweezers in hand to maneuver the hard plastic base of the tips. I was afraid I'd rip the silicone, since its really soft. Otherwise super cool! -The notice cancellation on these things is incredible! I live in NC, so the toads in my backyard croak harder than the bass at max volume. This is an understatement-- my ears and I live a life full of toad harassment throughout the night. Luckily, I can't hear a thing with these on! They also have a setting that adjusts to your voice, so when you speak, the headphones move back to transparency mode so you don't look like a lunatic screaming when someone talks to you. -New settings! There is a setting where if you're away from our phone, your AirPods will read your text notifications while you're away from your screen. Not super revolutionary, but its a nice feature to have when you want to stay in the know but also need to be on task at the same time! Dislikes: -The battery life on these things... sheesh! Nothing bad, but if you're switching from the older models of airpods you'll notice that the battery life on these things is way shorter. Not short by any means, but I only remember having to charge my old airpods maybe once a week. With these, it's seeming like every other day or a little more often. Nothing a wireless charging station can't fix, though. -The charger!!! I have a MacBook air from about 2016 and iPhone 11. Who cares about this? People who have slightly older models of laptops should! I was shocked when I opened the packaging (I'm always on the hunt for new chargers) and it didn't have a USB at the end of the lighting cord. That's code for I can't use it. Nothing major, but if you don't have a MacBook pro or other newer apple models, the charger will probably be incompatible with the USB blocks you have at home :) Overall, super good! I definitely recommend these to people, especially students, who are in noisy settings a lot but don't need to use AirPods constantly. If you want good sound quality with good compatibility AND the regular AirPods fall out of your ears, this is the model for you. If you like a more classic model, have the ideal ear size, and don't care that much for background noise, I'd just recommend getting the regular AirPods!\", 'Excellent - my go to bluetooth buds for everyday listening and convenience. I am a high fi buff and wanted something tgat delivers great music quality. I will review in more detail on that later. Big need for great noise canceling MICROPHONE for conversations. Clarity and noise free conversations for those on other end was very important to me. I found inexpensive buds that were great for music considering price. Unfortunately none really deliver on quality conversations for phone use. This one has and no complaints. The one area that is sorely lacking however for me is my comfort level with silicone tips just don’t cut it. Painful is right word but thats me to. I have bony inside canals and foam is only thing that works consistently. I found solution and awaiting quality memory foam ear foam tips  and in mail. Will update after received. The silicone tips just didn’t cut it. In fact busted one trying to remove from buds after attempting to exchange out with other tips. Because of everything else so good i decided to fork out the dough for the memory foam tips based on reviews. Hopefully will come through on expectations. Will update then. UPDATE- pain greatly reduced by changing position in ear. I found a ‘sweet spot ! By changing the post position - about 70 degrees from vertical. I don’t have much skin in ear - and bones conflict with slight oval seating of tip. I still thing memory foam will be ticket for best fit. But silicone tips can work in a pinch. Gotta play with them. Overall still a nice step up from standard under a hundred buds. Worth the extra price to me. Update - had over a month niw with memory Foam. Great upgrade-no pain at all better noise isolation and sound is not affected negatively as far as i can tell. CharJenPro is brand and they work nicely. Recommend black because they tend to discolor. DO NOT WASH WITH WATER! Still like buds ..', 'The Jabra elite 75 has more bass and better noise blocking and cancellation. The AirPod pros are much better at transparency/hear-through. I’ve had a reoccurring problem with myJabras where the left earbud wouldn’t connect. This is a common problem but it was replaced by their 2-year warranty. It took a few weeks after I sent my pair off before I got the replacement I prefer my AirPods for around the house and in meetings. I prefer my Jabras when I’m working in the yard (mowing) or if I want to hear more bass.', 'I went back and forth whether to buy the regular ones or the air pod pro. I checked the reviews and these were worth it the sound quality is amazing the noise cancellation is top notch with some of the best and the fact they are waterproof or claim to be I have not tested that out so I can’t say and the battery life is crazy good I had a pair of Bose and I am a huge Bose fan but the battery life never held up as good as the air pods do even my wife uses them and she has never been a huge fan of wireless head phones', 'Best earbuds I have ever had! After going through like 200-300 dollars worth of buds I finally came to my senses and bought some on sale on Amazon. Battery life is good because you can simply put your airpods back in the case and literally 5-10 min later the  right or left or both airpods will be ready to go! Charge them 30 min in the case and back to 100 percent! So you really can get over 18-23 hours of use. Keep the case charged! Also buy a case for your expensive white case! Ok I have dropped them a few times but you have to find the right buds for your ears! Try them out! Noise cancellation is great! I barely could hear my lawn mower with both buds in on noise canceling! Listen just buy the airpods! THE PROS!', 'I bought them for someone for Christmas. My niece in Japan. I have the first generation and the sound quality are awesome. The only thing I dislike is they fall out of my ear while I use them for Bluetooth at work. I should have lost them many times. I use a plantronics Bluetooth mostly. It works better than the AirPods for the functionality but the sound quality suffers. It’s just easier and more convenient.', 'I was very skeptical to spend the bread on the AirPod Pros but I am glad I did. They are by far the most comfortable buds I have ever worn. They instantly link up with my Apple products by just opening the case within proximity to the device. Noise cancelation is not perfect but it does rival some over-the-ear style headphones I have used in the past; certainly the best noise canceling ear buds I have ever used! The squeeze function is very satisfying for using the noise cancelation function and skipping songs. Siri is eerily on point with taking commands to control volume and other features included with the pros.....even asking the battery percentage on the fly. I know these AirPods will be my primary listening companion for some time to come. 2nd best accessory next to the Magic Keyboard with track pad.', 'I bought these as an anniversary gift for my wife. She adores them and loves using them to listen to music while we work out. The smile on her face was breathtaking. Apple makes a quality product.', 'I am very happy with the AirPods Pros. The sound quality is so much improved over the previous generation and the noise cancelling feature is amazing. I\\'ve been using Bose QC-35\\'s for years when I travel. I like them,  as they are great for air travel, but they are BIG and a pain to pack especially when you\\'re trying to squeeze them into your carry-on. The AirPods are so much smaller work well and really sound pretty incredible. I won\\'t be needing the Bose anymore and although they have served me well for years, it is time to move on to the Airpods as one of  my \"must haves\" when I fly. I am in the Pro-audio industry and I can tell you these things are really amazing. Worth every penny.', 'Won’t stay in my ears, even with ear hooks. Noise cancellation doesn’t work for crap and they aren’t very loud at all. I’m an incredibly active person, I body build as well as work outdoors with an arborist company so I’m constantly on the go and these things pop out at every turn. I’m scared to take them on a run with me for fear that they’ll fly out of my ears at any moment. For $200 you’d think they’d make a decent pair of earbuds. I bought a pair of Bose wireless earbuds over 2 1/2 years ago and thought I would try some that were just a little bit smaller but Apple AirPod pro don’t even compare to the noise cancellation and sound quality of Bose wireless. I am disappointed because the AirPod pros do you have some really great features but if I can’t keep them in my ears then they’re worthless to me. Super disappointed in this Apple product, going back to the Bose wireless', 'Honest review. When they work, I truly enjoyed the sound quality and noise cancellation feature of these AirPods. But literally within the first day of using my AirPod Pros I started experiencing Bluetooth connectivity issues. The AirPods would randomly start getting static every so often when I would start walking and then go back to normal. I thought this was a fluke so I let it go and didn’t think much of it. About a week later and I’m using them today and the same thing keeps happening, but worse. They would get so much static but this time it wouldn’t go away, so I would have to stop my song and try and reset them. Eventually the right bud just went out and wouldn’t come back on while the left remained in/out of static periodically. Needless to say I’m sending them back tomorrow for a replacement pair, I liked them that much when working. I could have just got a bad, faulty pair? Who knows. But it’s disappointing to spend $250 on a item and it not work properly. I would say this fault is most definitely on Apple and not Amazon however. Amazon provided me with the return label no questions asked and are sending me a new replacement pair in due time. Hopefully Apple will get a little better at thoroughly testing products before sending them out to sale.', 'I bought these due to the NC feature and the hope that the headphones will stay in my ear as I exercise. The NC works surprisingly well. For a good experience with audio and NC, it requires to find the right ear tip and it has a small program built in to confirm If the ear tip is the right one for you.  The fit is always important for keeping the earbud in place when exercising as well. This leads me to my biggest issue the ear tips. Perfect world, you will find an ear tip that keeps a tight fit and holds the earbud in place.  None really fit my well. I am constantly pushing the earbud into my ear to keep the fit tight.  Unfortunately. Apple made the earbuds proprietary so you can just switch the standard buds with say foam ones that I find work better. This is why I say try before buy. For $250, it is a shame that the headphones don’t sit well in my ears.', \"my work entails a lot of calls, so good quality earphones are a must. don't know how many times I dropped or removed the original airpods from my ears. these ones - not even once. bluetooth is seamless (with iphone) and never had an issue with battery life even on long calls. with the c-virus, I end up taking calls 5-6 hours in a day and still I charge them only 2-3 times in a week perhaps. sound quality is good, though I am not comparing with B & O kinda earphones. other surprising thing I found was that the slightly broader case makes a difference in gripping them and even without a silicon case, or holder i haven't dropped them till now. if you are ok with the price, go for them.\", 'The AirPod pros are great as far as sound and noise cancelation. But they aren’t durable?? Even though you pay $250 for them. I have spend 4 hours trouble shooting my pros but one headphone only works...it hasn’t even been a year. I have disconnected and “forget device”, hard rested the pros until I saw the abler light, waited 30 seconds, reset networking...etc. This is by far the most frustrating when you expend $250 on headphones you believed would’ve lasted you AT LEAST A YEAR. If anyone happens to know any other method that I haven’t tried please let me know.', 'I have sampled a ton of headphones over the years. I am a runner, mountain biker and avid outdoors man. I also do a great deal of outdoor work such as mowing, fertilizing and chainsawing. Not to knock other big name brands, but I have tried most of the ones that are listed as high dollar and supposedly the \"best\". For some, maybe so, but I have an extra issue on fit of the headphone. I was a very active wrestler and coach for many years and have what is called cauliflower ear. It misshapes the outer ear and makes it hard for headphones to stay put. Even with over the ear loops, the phone generally would work its way out and I would be left trying to replace it while running, riding or with dirty hands working. These little boogers just stay put and you don\\'t even feel them in the canal as they are so little and light. The noise cancellation is mind boggling - a full volume lawn mower is essentially muted when switched into the cancellation mode. Going back to transparency mode allows you to carry on as needed with conversation or for things you need to hear. Phone conversations are crystal clear on both ends .... these are amazing !!!!! I\\'ve only had them for a week or so, and haven\\'t put them to their ultimate test. However, I am completely satisfied and amazed at the same time over the smallness, sound, fit, simplicity in use and the amazing cancelling quality. The battery life would be the only area I would like to see stretch out. Otherwise - THE BEST HEADPHONES ON THE MARKET in my opinion.', \"I have the old generation and didn't want to replace them but the battery life was getting to where 15 mins in they would die and each bud would die at different rates. Went ahead and grabbed the new ones just expecting similar quality to the previous generation but was pleasantly surprised when the transparency and noise cancellation feature triggered on. Those two features are pretty sweet and very helpful for various scenarios. Battery life is significantly better than the first generation even when they were brand new. These things last for hours even when using the transparency or noise cancellation which I'd assume uses more battery. Definitely worth the purchase.\", 'I have been wanting these since the beginning of the pandemic, finally broke down and bought a pair after my third set of beats wireless stopped working. THESE ARE AMAZING! Such a game changer. The fit is pretty good, they do fall out sometimes but that could be because of the anatomy of my ears however the sound and phone quality is superb! No problem with bat  there life thus far.  Definitely recommend these for anyone on the edge. (FYI- I compare these to the Bose and Sony comparable models and chose these)', 'The sound quality is excellent,they are very responsive to touch and UI functions on the stem.The battery life for me doesn’t get close to the max time,about 80% of advertised life but that is probably because of constant noise reduction and higher volume.In the beginning both tips got a great seal but one side never seals completely unless I really forced it to fit.The smaller and larger tips don’t help as medium is definitely my size.They stay in very well for walking and case holds a great charge.Not perfect but excellent choice for noisy environments.', \"I tried several high-end earbuds that all cost more than $150. They all give me the same problem. They put pressure on parts of my ear that hurt over long periods of time. not with these. The soft tips make it a lot easier for me to wear them for long periods of time and that also allows me to be more comfortable with them. yeah they cost more money. And that is the fact that you're just going to have to get over. If you're concerned only about money then look elsewhere. But if you're looking for something that's comfortable for long periods of time and is a good investment these are it. There's a reason why this company spends a billion dollars a year in research and development.\", \"I have adorable tiny elfin ears and was hoping that these would fit and stay in my ear. (I also have Galaxy Buds, which do stay in, but doesn't sync with my desktop for some reason.) Even with the smaller rubber thingies, they still won't stay in. The AirPod fit test says I need the medium-sized tips, but those aren't as comfortable as the little tips and don't stay in any better. The sound quality of these is great - much better than the Galaxy Buds, and I'll use them for phone calls when I'm at my desk and won't move around much.\", \"I like how easy they pair with all my apple devices but that is about it....... I find they don't fit well, they are a total pain to change volume as you have to ask Siri to do it and she never get it!  I then have to get my phone while walking to do the volume on my phone!  BAD design from apple.  I am super disappointed with these considering how expensive they are!  I wish a less expensive ear pod would pair better as I wouldn't have purchased these.\", 'Mine stopped working after about 1 year. The sound quality is not a Bose or a Sony. I think it’s good if you just want to fit in with the crowd and pay a high price for it. But if you want a quality product, this won’t fit the bill. Both my ear pods failed at about 3 and 5 months, respectively. Thankfully they were getting several complaints so they replaced without too many issues. A week after one year warranty expired, the charging case itself won’t work. Apple support wants me to pay 89$ + tax to replace. What a joke! This product is too expensive and absolute garbage given how many issues it causes. It’s just not well built and their made in China QC is trash. Apple is an average phone company - they should stick to that and not try to get in areas they can’t deal with.', \"I am a fan of Apple's products and felt compelled to splurge on the AirPods Pro now that I am working remotely full time. For the past couple of years, I have used Bose SoundSport earbuds for exercising and am used to that fit and sound quality. For work calls, I had typically used the Apple EarPods (wired) out of the iPhone box. These are great for calls because they don't plug up your ears while you talk, whereas the Bose SoundSport earbuds fit to always block outside noise. After a few weeks of using the AirPods Pro, I found myself always having the 'Transparent' setting turned on in order to switch between music and calls. This function drains the battery, but also seems to be a feature that was served without needing a special setting in the earbud for the base level AirPods/EarPods. I guess my point is that the key to AirPods Pro is the noise cancellation for music, while also having the option to hear the outside world. Using the Bose SoundSport as a baseline for sound quality comparison, the AirPods Pro unfortunately finishes multiple rungs below the SoundSport purely for music audio quality. There is relatively little bass and while the noise cancellation feature improves sound slightly for use at home or in public places, it's virtually useless on an airplane in-flight. Lastly, the 'sock' tip for the AirPods Pro does not grip well when sweating during a workout, or even laying out at the pool and getting some sweat in the ear. While not sweating, the 'sock' tips just seem cheap and I often worry about the AirPods Pro falling out of my ears. If I had a do-over, I would buy the regular AirPods to save on cost, have a better grip in-ear, and have more outside sound transparency for phone calls. I'd then reserve the Bose SoundSport earbuds for exercise, flights, and a much higher-quality music listening experience.\", 'Everything is perfect. It actually surpassed my expectations - specially in the noise cancelling dept. I enjoy A LOT the transparency mode specially; it’s super useful for everyday interactions. The only thing I got a bit disappointed about was on how my ears hurt after long time of wear. I guess that’s normal with any earbuds though; I’ve heard that the AirPods Pro are designed to accommodate overtime to your ear’s ergonomics, so hope that’ll solve soon. I have the original AirPods, and I got to say the extra dollars are totally worth it. Although it depends primarily on who and how they will be used, you won’t be wrong with the AirPods Pro - specially for the noise cancellation feature.', \"I've owned the original AirPods since shortly after their release and was always very pleased by them, battery lasted long, the sound quality was above that of EarPods (but not anything exceptional), and just overall felt revolutionary. Picked up these pros when they were on sale and was sadly not finding them very comfortable. The sound quality was that of a good pair of $100~$200 headphones and the noise cancellation was superb, but they just didn't sit comfortably in my ears. Tried all size tips for a few days and I just couldn't get used to them. Ended up selling to a friend and continue to happily use my original AirPods\", 'These are simply better than the old gen. Love the fact they won’t easily fall out. Shipped faster than expected which was a plus cause I accidentally washed my old ones in the washing machine (incidentally after a night in dry rice they still worked but had little bass…now my backup pair)', \"I've had the Samsung Galaxybuds and Bose Soundsport Free, and I can say that these airpod pros hit the spot. First of all, the battery case size is just right to fit in jeans pockets. The Bose case is way too large and has battery capacity that I personally would never get to use even half between wall charges. The Galaxybuds case is about the same size but much thicker. The active noise cancelling does give me a headache when no sound is being played, so I have to either keep music playing or take them off between conference calls. Not much of an issue for me, just something to keep in mind. The fit of the earbuds is comfortable, and the stem has been designed to be shorter than the Airpods, which I personally think is an improvement. The connection to my samsung S10+ has been seamless, installed the MaterialPods app and I can see the battery percentages similar to iOS. Switching connection to my Macbook Pro is quick, but I do wish the earbuds can connect to multiple devices without having to resync every time.\", 'No matter what ear tip i try these have fallen out time and time again since I bought them. For the few minutes that they stay in the seal is great and the sound quality is good but I end up wearing my normal aipods every time! Who has the time and energy to be picking their air pods or from the floor every five minutes when they fall out during a work out? I wish I had never bought them. Money wasted.', 'This was my second try  at AirPods Pro. I’ve returned both and will stick with my Jabras. I have an iPhone 11 and even after literally hours on the phone with Apple troubleshooting, etc.,pairing was very intermittent leading to terrible frustration and disappointment.  Unless Amazon is tricking me with generic fakes, my experience with AirPods has been a joke. Hours and hours wasted watching videos, on phone with Apple, etc. can’t recommend these at all, even with an iPhone.', 'Let me start off by saying these are a solid pair of wireless earbuds. The sound quality is the best I’ve heard from earbud style headphones and the battery life is as advertised (~5 hours depending on volume and ANC). These things also hold very well in my ears and I don’t have an issue with them falling out. My biggest complaint comes from the active noise cancellation feature. I live in a rural area where essentially all the noise in my bedroom comes from an air purifier. The ANC feature significantly reduces the noise of the air purifier compared to passive mode, but it doesn’t reduce it to the point where I’m impressed for the price. I’ve seen complaints about the current firmware reducing the effectiveness of ANC (these ones shipped with the most recent firmware installed and there’s no way to revert to the old firmware apparently). If that’s the case, then I hope Apple will crank the ANC capabilities back up in a future firmware update because these would then be an unbeatable pair of wireless earbuds. All in all,  I like these things, but unless the ANC issue gets worked out I’m thinking I would have been better off getting 2nd gen AirPods over the Pros. That being said, I will hold onto them in hopes Apple will improve ANC in a future update.', 'I have had these for 7 months now. PROS: noise cancellation is good, not great, but good given they are inserted into ear. sound is good, clarity is good fit is ok, comes w S/M/L tips for ear fit. You can use the ear \"test\" feature and it will test the sound to validate correct fit. calls are clear CONS: seems to be a common issue for these.  my right ear pod \"vibrates\" like the sound you would expect on a blown subwoofer or speaker.  A rattle noise.  Googled around, seems to be an issue that is arising. I would not buy these until new model comes out and get the apple care coverage!', \"One would think that Apple's closed universe approach to its products would mean that AirPods would seamlessly sync with an iPhone but it definitely doesn't. Prior to this, I had Jabras that would occasionally not sync with my iPhone. AirPods seem to be unable to sync - or say that it's synced without actually working - about 1/3 to 40% of the time. Sound quality, hear-through, and comfort are all great but extremely worthless if it can't reliably sync.\", 'I tried out multiple different manufacturers, and styles of wireless, noise cancelling earbuds and headphones.  I was hoping to find a pair that I liked a lot that were less expensive.  But in the end I decided to shell out the money for these, because imo they were hands down the best I tried.  I’m extremely happy with my purchase.  I keep the earbuds in their case inside of another case when not in use to keep them safe (from jostling, dropping or losing one or both).', 'I have had the original apple AirPods for years.  When taking a phone call, people cannot hear me. So I decided it was time to get a new pair.  I bought these.  Unfortunately I didnt like them. They would not stay in my ears!  I tried all the different ear buds that came with them. So frustrating. I am very active. I had to stop a workout, pick them up and put back in ears.', 'I was very hesitant on purchasing a $200 earbud and I was right. The sound volume is so low! I usually only have 1 earbud in and it works great with other earbuds but when I have only 1 airpod in, I can barely hear anything at “normal volume.” I have to raise the volume so much its pretty much max volume on my phone. Definitely returning this. I’m disappointed in the quality.', \"It has only been 12 hours or so since I started using the airpod. The sound doesn't impress. Noise cancellation (first time user) experience is unique and is totally worth the price in combination with the convenience and mobility. Wore to Gym this morning. It help well during my 2 mile run. I sweat a lot. Walked of the treadmill and left pod fell when I bent to drink water. Picked it up. After a minute there was some vibration when playing but not it is fine. When I took my glasses off, one of the pods fell off again. Came home and my daughter said, it is user error as I did not use the correct size pod cover. Havent' checked that yet. Read another review that sound will get better in a day or 2. Lets see. It is important but not a deal breaker.\", \"My AirPods don't seem to be water or sweat resistant. Some water got on them and they stopped working for a day. Also, they keep slipping off my ear every now and then, and even though the size is completely perfect for my ears, they still slip after a while. The noise cancellation isn't completely perfect because I still hear everything around me, the difference is that they are a little less noisy. Additionally, they keep disconnecting every 15 minutes. I contacted Apple and they told me to reset them but they still disconnect. I feel like they don't deserve that much money to be spent on them. I'm disappointed.\", \"Don't buy, Apple support is stupid! The left earbud doesn't connect after 1 and half month, chatted with Amazon to get a replacement for the left side, they chat with Apple. Charge me $98.97 to get a replacement for the left earbud. Funny that I never received the replacement, when I write this review I have spent another 1 hour with a representative from Amazon who is trying to connect me with Apple. I have wasted 5+ hours to sort this out, it's not worth it, so disappointed.\", \"The original Airpods didn't appeal to me at all, these essentially are a call from consumers to fix all the issues wrong with the previous generation and I'd say they nailed it. The pros offer insane comfort, usability, and quality. Noise cancellation is crazy good, not the best, but definitely still great. It's just overall an amazing product.\", 'Good product but flawed mechanical design. Go the the forums and google “AirPod pro rattling sound”. Tha ma me later. You are bound to experience the rattling sound wishing 1-6 months of owning this money making machine from Apple. No fix exist. The only option is to hope you have warranty and then Apple will send you either left or right earbud replacement.', \"With COVID, I was one of the lucky ones who got to keep her job. This meant a transition to working from home. Part of my job is chatting with clients and internal stakeholders. My old Apple AirPods were just not doing it - I couldn't get through a one-hour meeting on the old AirPods without having to switch out to another headset. Enter this lovely gift! I can listen to my podcasts and take calls more or less all day long! Also great for noise cancellation. I did read some other reviews saying to only charge the case to 80% to avoid issues. I would highly recommend these AirPods!\", 'I multiple sets of corded and wireless earbuds but these blow them all away! I have the best Bose head phones and these blow them away. As soon as you put them in you experience the noise cancellation that is way better than Bose! They turn on and off by putting in and out of your ear. They know they are in you ears and talk to you as soon as you put them in. If you leave your phone on, you have a no hands phone!  It works with Siri and does everything you need easily thru voice commands!', 'I truly ordered these on a whim! I have never owned a pair of AirPods or AirPod Pros and I love them . Before I have own Bose truly wireless an the Skullcandy truly wireless an even though they are both good brands from expensive to cheap but if you want great wireless headphones I’d definitely buy these again. Supper easy to pair! Took less then 1 min battery life is great each headphone lasted about 31/2hrs straight out the box fully charged 4 hrs an 45min the noise cancellation is one of the best I really impressed lol sound quality is great from the highs to the base just some of the highest quality I have heard in a while! The weight of the headphones in the ears is awesome to I don’t even realize there in my ear!  So if your not on a budget an have the extra 50 or 60 bucks I’d choose AirPod pros with out a doubt! I hope this helped !', \"I never jumped on the original AirPod train. Those free headphones that came with apple merchandise always hurt my ears because the earpod was too big. That said, with the adjustable Airpod Pro, I decided to give these a chance after hearing rave reviews from friends who had purchased. These are great! I mostly use these for phone calls because I'm still working form home due to COVID-19. The noise cancelling is so great that I legitimately thought my boyfriend was whispering when he was talking at full volume. I use the smallest ear cushion and it works fine for a couple hours, however I do wish they had an extra small because after about 4 hours, my ears do get a little sore (but nothing compared to the original headphones apple provided). This might be because of how it's positioned in my ear. If I find that to be true, I'll come back and edit the review.\", \"I have both Sony over-the-ear wh-1000xm4 and these airpod pros... I love my Sonys more if you're going for THE BEST sound quality and noise-cancellation, however, they are NOT convenient for everyday wear and tear and use. These airpods fill that need. The noise cancellation is like stuffing marshmallows in your ear. You can still hear around them if loud enough, but most of the sound is muffled and cut out. They're great for runs and for working around the house and while on errands.\", \"I have to give a hearty thumbs up to this product. Another great product from Apple. The noise cancellation feature is incredible. I can't hear the fan noise from the rangehood while cooking and listening to a show. And my colleagues can't hear me chewing while I am on a call. What else can you ask for in nowadays?\", \"I was super excited for the AirPods Pro. Loved my regular AirPods. After some shipping issues from amazon I finally got my pair. THEY SUCK.  Literally they are an inferior product to the regular AirPods at a higher price. PROS: Sound Good! Noise Isolation is Great! Transperacy feature is cool. CONS: QUALITY SUCKS These are just really unreliable. Randomly y disconnect, One doesn't charge, case doesn't charge, Microphone cuts out. The 3 inner ear tips also are horrible. My old AirPods never fell out but these will fall out with my just talking on the phone. I wish I could return these and just get the regular AirPods.\", \"This is actually the third Airpods Pro I received within the same transaction, returned the other two due to different quality issues. From this point, I am quite disappointed with Apple's quality control. This Airpods Pro works perfectly with my apple devices and the experiences have been even better after upgrading to IOS 14. The noise cancellation doesn't reach my expectation since they don't fit my ear well and I have to adjust them frequently. As an earpod from Apple, I didn't have any expectations with its sound quality and it didn't surprise me either. Overall, if you have multiple Apple devices, it is still your best option since it's the only available option. Android users might have a wider options.\", \"If all I want to do with these is listen to music, they're fine but if I need to use them to make a call and am anywhere but a completely silent place, they are USELESS. People say that the background noise is magnified and they can barely hear me at all. So basically if an ant is walking by outside, the person can't hear me. If I were a teenager just talking about nonsense that would be one thing but I'm a professional who desires to use them to talk on the phone or video calls. I have had to pull out my old wired iphone earbuds for phone calls. Why did I spend over $200 for these? To listen to music? No thanks! I bought them during the pandemic when I was working at home ALONE so didn't realize the issue until the world started to open back up and I started traveling again. They are useless. Completely useless.\", 'I regret purchasing these AirPods. They don’t stay in my ear, they fall out quite a lot. I can’t answer or hang up with my AirPods. It cuts off in the middle of my conversations and then doesn’t connect when I’m in the car unless I hang up and call back. I have had generation 1 and generation 2 and I loved them both. I wish I had purchased generation 2 like I did previously. I loved those and they fit my ear so well. Now I’m struggling keeping the earbud in ugh. I hate I didn’t purchase the others while they were on sale. I made the wrong choice.', 'Before getting into the review, I want to give you my background story. I\\'m more of a casual listener and by no means I consider myself an audiophile.  I used Airpods first gen for quite some time and I really enjoyed them. As they began to age, I started looking for a replacement. I was torn between getting Airpods 2nd gen, or spending a bit more and getting Airpods pro. After watching several reviewers saying the pros sound considerably better than Airpods gen 2, I was finally convinced to give these a shot, mainly because I\\'ve never used noise cancelling ear buds before and was curious to try them out. Having said that, let\\'s dive into the review. I will it break down into five categories: (Design, comfort, sound quality, features and battery life) Design:  Airpods pro are a pair of good looking ear buds. I never thought original Airpods looked bad, but Airpods pro definitely look much better. I definitely appreciated the shorter stem. No complaints here. Comfort: Airpods pro come with replaceable silicon ear tips in three different sizes (S, M, L), whereas original Airpods come with plastic ear buds. Many people praised the new ear tips because they were more comfortable and would not fall off their ears as regular Airpods did; However, my experience was quite the opposite. Even after trying all three ear tips, Airpods pro felt uncomfortable after wearing them for a while. Also, they would not fit in my ear as well as regular Airpods, which caused them to constantly fall off. I could use regular Airpods for hours without feeling any discomfort, plus they would never fall off. Long story short, original Airpods have a better fit for me and are more comfortable to wear than Airpods pro. Sound Quality: I had big expectations about the sound quality from these earbuds. Airpods gen 1 had excellent sound and I had no complaints. However from the moment I first used Airpods pro, I immediately noticed they don\\'t sound that great. I feel Airpods 1 had a crisp and bright sound, but Airpods pro lacked brightness and sounded a bit \"dull\". After doing some research online I found out you can go to settings > accessibility > Headphones accommodations and tweak the sound to make it brighter. To be honest this helped a bit, but I still was not satisfied with the sound quality. On top of that Airpods 1 had a small hole at the upper part of each earbud which added bass to the sound. For some reason, that hole is no longer included with Airpods pro, which causes them to sound less bassy. This is a subtle change not a lot of people talk about, but it\\'s something that really bothered me. Features: The two main features advertised with the Airpods pro are Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode, both of which worked really well. I tried noise cancelling while commuting on the bus and the subway and it does an amazing job at blocking most of the outside noise. You can still hear some loud noises, but those are muted significantly. As for Transparency mode, it amplifies outside noise so you can be aware of your surroundings while listening to music. This was quite helpful while I was walking on the street and did not want to be completely isolated from the outside world. Overall I\\'d say these two features are a solid 10/10 Battery life: On paper Airpods pro have less battery life than Airpods 2 (4.5 hours of playback time on Airpods pro, vs 5 hours on Airpods 2). Nevertheless, this was never a problem for me. I never got to completely kill the battery. The earbuds also charge really fast when you put them inside the case. In short, I would not say battery life is not an issue with Airpods pro. In conclusion, I was quite disappointed with Airpods pro. Although I was highly satisfied the Noise Cancelling feature, sound quality was not what I expected. Besides, they were not as comfortable as I thought and they would fall off my ears easily.  I ended up selling the Airpods pro and I will order a pair of Airpods 2. At the end of the day using headphones is a very subjective experience. Maybe you\\'ll pick them up and like them more than I did. I definitely suggest trying them out first if you can. If you enjoy Airpods pro\\'s sound quality and you find them comfortable, I\\'d say go for these instead of Airpods 2 (Prime Day is coming up soon. I bet Airpods pro will be on sale at a much lower price). For me, I will be sticking with good ol\\' Airpods 2 for the time being.', 'Although sound quality is amazing, I must remove the earbud and place it in the charging case so others can hear me on a phone call. I have the top iPhone 12 max+ so my phone isn’t the issue. Callers can not hear me and just selecting another mode on the phone doesn’t help. It automatically reverts to the airpod pros while you are trying to have a conversation. My son has the new iPhone 13 and has the same problem with his airpod pro. So sad…', 'If you’re buying this product, you know (or can read about) all of the features.  Of course, Apple products are well-made, reliable, blah blah blah.  As a classical musician, to me the sound quality is fine but lacks a little low end presence, which you will be hard-pressed to get from earbuds anyway.  “Noise cancellation” is used quite liberally with these; you DO notice a difference, but again, there’s only so much that earbuds can do.  They pair very easily with my other Apple products, and I haven’t had any connection issues at all.  The battery life is also impressive, and I like being able to charge the pods from the case on the go.  All-in-all, this is a great product if you enjoy listening to music on the go!', \"Weird, we don't seem to be Apple fanatics. Yet a survey of our devices found 2 iPad minis, 2 iPhone 10 Max, and 2 Air Pod Pros. An iPhone 6 and iPad recycled to a family member. So maybe we are Apple cultists? Work great, integrate with all the other stuff easily, and at Xmas we got a killer price on these our second set. I bought the 'other' kind that seemed to have decent reviews. They paired sometimes, sometimes not. Two brands I returned to amazon the first day I had them. So end of the day, these are better for us. Simplicity being the price of admission.\", \"I was excited to buy this ear buds, but no matter what I did or bought to attach to these ear buds it still won't stay in my ears. I've bought 2 different kinds of attachments that I thought would keep these thing from falling off, but those did'nt work at all. Finally I just had to give it to my wife. She does'nt have the same problem as me but she also hardly uses them. Very strange design, I have 6 pairs of in-ear headphones, and all of them fit perfectly, the air pods pro is hopeless for me.\", 'I had the original AirPods which I absolutely loved but my biggest issue with them was when I would fly (which is quite often) I wouldn’t be able to hear my downloaded show or movie. Music was fine but the roar of an airplane jet is a lot. I’ve had them for 3 years and they are really crapping out now so it was time for an upgrade. I decided to try the pros so I could have the noise canceling for flights. I like them bc they are small and fit in my pocket or purse. They connect so smoothly and quickly. I’ve flown several times with them and I love the noise canceling for the plane. I can still hear a beep when an announcement is about to come on so I can pause my show and quickly switch the noise canceling off so the outside noises filter in. And switch back real quick so I never have to take them out of my ears. Obviously it doesn’t cut out all the noise but it definitely does what I needed it to do. If I listened to music I definitely couldn’t hear a thing with the noise canceling turned on. I also workout with them and if I’m running on the road or around people I can filter the noise in and if I keep my music semi low then I know if something is coming or someone is trying to talk to me. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because they hurt my ears. Mostly just 1 ear. I guess I have smaller ears so I don’t find them as comfortable as the regular AirPods. Other than that the quality of sound is great and they work for what I need them to do.', 'Pros: - Sound quality is great - The functionality you get with these is amazing.  You can use your phone as a wireless mic to listen to things far away, turn on and off your noise cancelation so you can hear your flight details over the intercom. - Audio automatically stops if the buds fall out. - Apple connectivity. Automatically connects once paired. Cons: - Battery life leave some to be desired - The left earpiece for me ALWAYS falls out.  I barely use it anymore. I tried all the included buds. - No onboard volume control.  Must control volume from phone - My most expensive buds I have ever bought for ALMOST equal sound quality. Concluision: Great little devices, bought two for my wife and I.  We use them to work, handle calls, and on bike rides (although I only use the right earpiece for this.)', 'Bought 1st pair and after about 3 months the right ear bud quit working.  It will not take a charge in fact if I put them both in a charger the right will drain the left and leave both empty.  I called customer support only to be told they could sell me a refurbished bud. My wife knew how much I enjoyed them when they worked and bought me a new set.  After 6 weeks the exact same thing happed to the new pair.  Right bud will not charge or work.  So much for apple products.', 'Bluetooth like the way they fit in my ears seems pretty snug at times you may want to possibly change the pads to make sure that they don’t slip out from your ears as a precaution but I do love the way you can switch between the noise canceling feature. I recommend these apple air pod pro.', \"1. The latency is pretty bad. When I bought the Bose QuietComfort 35, I was surprised and pleased at the lack of perceptible latency. But with the Airpods Pro, the latency is back in a big way. 2. The sound quality is OK but not as good as my Sennheiser RS 185. 3. The noise cancellation doesn't come close to the Bose QuietComfort 35. 4. If the 4.5 hours of listening time per charge is correct, this falls way short of both the Bose QuietComfort 35 and the Sennheiser RS 185. About the only thing they have going for themselves is portability and in-the-ear rather than over-the-ear.\", 'The left side doesn’t work at all on it’s own unless the right one is in the case. If i try to use both, only the right side works, the left doesn’t and it is frustrating. It is just very inconvenient and am thinking of returning it if I take it to the Apple store and they can’t figure it out. I will be left with no choice. I hate to return items like this and it breaks my heart to do so. when receding a call, both sides work but playing audio, only the right side works or if i want the left side to work, I would have to remove the right side and place in the case. Too much work. The noise cancellation is nonexistent for me and that is the main reason I bought this set of airpod pros. ai hope the seller can reach out and help', 'Tuve estos audífonos por unos 3 meses y los parlantes empezaron a chicharrear, se le satura el sonido o algo q se hace muy desagradable, son muy delicados. El micrófono al parecer no toma bien la señal ya q  al otro lado no se escucha bien. Cuando estaban nuevos andaban perfecto pero al poco tiempo de uso empezaron con estos problemas. No estoy muy seguros de volver a comprar estos mismos, una lástima porque como digo al principio estaba todo perfecto. Quizas compre unos Sennheiser, ahí estoy viendo...', 'Outside of Bose’s noise cancelation earbuds, these Apple AirPod Pro’s are the best for everything. They beat out Bose in design and although you may not have as much noise cancelation, it’s not significant enough to have a really bulky ear bud, like Bose’s. Apples AirPods look professional and get the job done in every way possible.', 'The box and the headphones came perfectly in tact. The headphones themselves offer an Apple Inc caliber of qualities and features. My videos automatically pause when one or both of my headphones are taken out of my ear. The mic picks up my voice and nullifies the background noise when talking on the phone. The sound quality of the phone calls is also mentionable. The noise canceling function works surprisingly well; but the transparency mode is what really impresses me. The microphone picks up the sound around you and you can hear clearly everything that’s going on in the room without having to take your headphones off. I don’t know much about the noise canceling function, but I assume that it works so well because this microphone picks up noise on the outside and blocks it from coming in thru the headphones. Overall very content. The AirPod pros are definitely worth the buck.', 'My daughter is in love!  I am so happy that I was able to buy these at a good price before Thanksgiving when Amazon had a sale AND I opened up an Amazon charge and got another $30 off.  Without these discounts these are too expensive!  Love the update to the ear pieces...we know from experience that the previous hard style hurt and don’t stay in our ears so there was never an interest in purchasing them.  The new ones are very comfortable and stay put!  Sound quality is excellent as expected!  May need to purchase myself some if I can get a good price!', 'Sounds amazing,looks good on the outside but wow. It was the most disgusting earphones I ever seen on my life. It’s like shrek used these things. Ear wax all over the place even on the inside of almost all the ear buds. Horrible I threw them away and took the biggest size. Used 90% alcohol 3 times to clean everything. Also no charging box. So for what it’s worth I would have to say it’s ok but never again will I buy anything used from amazon. Really bad experience. The 5 stars are because the casing for the pods was in good condition and wax free also the pods sounded good after a 25 minute deep cleaning. But fr guys at amazon step it up and clean these things or replace the buds. We are in a Covid pandemic and you guys shouldn’t be letting products be sold like this.', 'Lightyears better than the original AirPods and extremely comparable to Bose products, the AirPods Pro are my perfect solution for what I was looking for; a wireless bud that doesn’t agitate my ear canal, stays in my ears for light workouts and most importantly, works clearly on an airplane cabin where I am a majority of my time. These work fantastically in even the loudest of airline cabins with clear sound that’s great for movies or music. Compared to non noise cancelling headphones, you won’t need the loudness level to those high volume levels; it’s only fault is the battery life which isn’t as long as some other earbuds out there. The AirPods case recharges the earbuds quickly though and does a descent job at protecting them. If you’re looking for wireless buds that have active noice cancelling, just seamlessly work with Apple products and work exceedingly well in an aircraft cabin, these are worth trying out.', 'Was skeptical at first only because I’ve bought cheap knockoff’s at first just to use at work which was a waste of money and time. You get what you pay for. Finally bought these and now wish I would’ve bought these sooner. Love these things and the battery life is definitely good. Love the noise cancellation and how easy it is to turn it on and off. Plus to pause and resume a song, skip forward or backwards of a song is easy as well. I thought it was also pretty neat that you can do a sound test in the blue tooth settings to see which size earbuds best sit in your ear for the best sound.', \"AirPods link easily to my iPhone 11 but sound quality is poor for $200 (on sale).  I see a lot of Zoomers using them on their calls but that's voice, not music.  Neither Apple iTunes or Spotify sound quality was good.  I thought it might be the tips so I swapped to smaller tips with no difference.  Maybe they don't fit my ear correctly?  There's no way to tell. Remember, these require USB-C to recharge them. I bought an adapter on an auction site so I didn't have to pay full Apple price because my PC/Mac are too old to have USB-C.  The case/charger is a very nice feature but not enough for me to keep them.\", 'I am actually very impressed with how good the noise cancellation is. It’s not completely silent but it’s a drastic difference between the 1st and second generation. At the gym it’s AMAZING! I don’t have to over hear the crappy gym music with these headphones in! I also don’t have to hear the the grunts and yelps the locals belch out at the gym when lifting weights. It’s an incredible way to escape as well when I practice my morning meditation. It frees me from any distraction. The options between ear sizing is amazing! The smaller bud option fits so perfectly in my ear compared to the uncomfortable feeling I would get from the past two gens. I love these AirPod Pro’s so much that I actually use these more often then I thought I would.', 'I like listening to audio while in an elliptical machine, and also to music in noisy places. The noise cancelling works really nicely for such small product. I had cervical spine surgery twice and heavy headphones are a no go for me, this the airpods pro really will be the piece to use. My son insisted in the purchase we are Android user and was skeptical, bit I am really happy with the purchase. He made me purchase as a birthday gift to myself, well worth it!', \"I love AirPods. Unfortunately, my last pair did not survive the assault by my washing machine and dryer. So I decided to upgrade and to my dismay, one of the earbuds gave off a horrid static sound. After much Google, I found out they just needed to be updated. Just stick the buds in their case, charge it, make sure they are connected to an iOS device with internet, and be patient-- the update will happen automatically. Now, the sound quality is as amazing as expected and the ANC is working flawlessly as well. A bit pricey, but worth it if you're an iPhone user.\", 'these now for 12 months and they have gotten extensive use. They started off perfect and 10000x time more comfortable than the originals. I use these almost every day at work, riding my bike, and around the house when cleaning. During quarantine, I would go on long walks and talk to my friends through them. Five months in I noticed the speaker would make start to crackle. It only started when someone was laughing or changing their octaves when speaking. Now the crackling happens all the time while on the phone, or listening to music. It is a shame because I love these things but the more you use them the worse they will become.', \"When Airpods first came out, I had no interest in getting them. It was cool that the gen 1 series was wireless but I was happy enough with my 10 pairs of Apple headphones over the years - they were functional. I got these for my dad for Xmas and he loved them. I tried them out myself and was amazed by the noise cancellation feature that I ended up buying a pair for myself. I really use them for connecting to my laptop for video calls or listening to Spotify at work. My second high use for them is at the gym which has been amazing! Using the noise cancellation feature at the gym, tunes out all of the buzzing noises from the fans, to the weight drops, and to hearing the thuds on the treadmill. I can solely focus in on my jams or whatever show/podcast I might have playing. As far as comfort, I did have to switch to the smaller head pieces so they could fit better. I don't worry about losing them, as long as I always put them back in the case and I'm not sure how great battery life is compared to the non-pro airpods, but I do enjoy these.\", \"Only apple could figure a way to compress 2 channel stereo, into 1 AirPod; (MONO) These are perfect for me, because I'm deaf in my right ear, & PERFECT in my left. Subsequently, this is the perfect device for me; I get all the music, not just 1 channel, in my right ear Best of all, the other AirPod, is constantly charging, giving me additional hours of pleasure Sound is not quite as good as my Etymotic ER 4XR's; corded;but the convenience of wireless Bluetooth, usurps the slight sound loss; of course, the corded version, can't produce 2 channels of sound in my good ear; Thanks, again, Apple!\", 'I can’t say enough about these AirPods.  I never had the original pair so I can’t say if they are better. I will however say these are amazing.  They have a noise canceling mode and I swear you can’t hear soMe one talking next to you it’s crazy.  We travel a lot they are amazing on the airplane you can’t hear engine noise, people talking, babies, kids ect.  Battery life is crazy.  We had a long international flight I watched movies for 7 hours straight they finally died around that point I put them back in the case and within maybe 20 minutes they were back to 50% charged.  My daughter got these for Christmas.  My husband ordered a pair the next day I ordered a pair with in a month we ALL LOVE them.', 'I was hesitant to spend this much on these but after trying my boyfriends, I needed my own.  They gave surprising features: you can choose to be noise canceling or not, noise canceling works better that my Bose over ear headphones, they dictate text messages, and they have a sensor that knows when you take them out and automatically pauses what your listening to.  I even used them during a noisy flooring project at my home and felt peacefully unaware of the loud banging noise until removing.  The only thing is they sometimes fall out so I have to be really careful not to drop into dish water, toilet, mud, and I wouldn’t dare on the bike.', 'I fell in love with these headphones, not because they sound great, but because they’re so convenient. Then they slowly started losing functionality, now they won’t even connect to my iPhone. At first the right bud wouldn’t charge on occasion. Then I lost “Hey Siri” and noise cancellation. I’ve tried to update these to no avail, maybe it was just mine but after many tutorials and hopes and prayers it just wouldn’t happen. I finally tried to reset them but only managed to make my phone not want to have anything to do with them. Servicing them is not an option due to COVID-19 and I’ve only had these for two and a half months. That puts me a month and a half past the return window. Thankfully Apple is cool about and is sending me a replacement. If they hadn’t then who knows how long I’d be stuck with this $250 paperweight.', \"Battery life poor, conversation boost very poor. sound is picked up by phone not earbuds, I wear an Otterbox clip, so you hear a very loud tud if you hit it with your hand or even the shirt, it picks up every sound around the phone NOT the earbuds so if you use live on. you hear that sound twice, like watching tv, you hear the tv's sound first then the earbuds, is very annoying, if somebody pass you by behind and say hello  you,  barely hear it and hear other noises in this case around my waist. Don't get me wrong I have and love Apple devices, this one is just a NO for the price. however the concept is right, just need to work on the sound, it should be pick up on the earbuds NOT on the phone itself.\", 'Theres literally only one problem with the ear buds and its compared to the normal apple headphones, the changeable ear buds slide out of your ears. It comes with different sizes so you can play with it a little bit, but they have a tendency to slide out. I was going to give it 4 stars because of it, but to be honest if you can get it in right, it doesnt happen. Other than that, everything else about them is a perfect! hence the five stars I have plenty of noise cancelling headphones, none of them have the technology like this. Its like if you had a TV remote and hit the mute button on the world. Its a DRASTIC difference and the audio is crystal clear. Battery is about what you expect from wireless earbuds - its pretty long and seeing the battery percentage when you hold the case up is pretty cool. Im a fan', \"The AirPods Pros are such an upgrade from the regular AirPods! I have always hated the Apple headphones since the corded days. They hurt my ears and just aren't that great, definitely overrated. But when the Pros came out I knew I had to have them. I do have to say that aren't the best for working out / sweating and I would recommended the Power Beats Pros for that. But for day to day life Apple AirPod Pros are where it's at! Follow my Amazon Storefront & Instagram {@stephanieh.510} for more! AirPod Pro case info can be found in the storefront.\", \"I had the old Airpods and was looking to upgrade since the battery life was depleting on the old set. I was hesitant on buying the Airpods Pro because of the buds that go into the ear canal. I generally hate those and they don't feel right (comfort and volume levels). HOWEVER, these Airpods Pro were incredible! The default plugs were a perfect fit, and they still provide you with a small and large option for different ear shapes. These things are awesome with the new addition of spatial sound. I sometimes forget where I am when listening to music or movies through them.\", 'Let me preface by saying that i\\'ve never owned previous Airpods, and my experience has been with Sennheisers, Bose, Sony for noise-cancelling headsets (the large cans). The Airpods Pro don\\'t win any award for sound quality, but they\\'re amazing for the portability and usability factor. In my previous trip to Europe (over 10 hours flight), I took the Airpods Pro and the Sony Xm3 (large cans with amazing sound quality), I found myself using the Airpods A LOT more than I thought I would. At 1 point, I thought to myself, \"hmm.. seems like the Airpods can be my only go-to now\". Now the sound cancellation isn\\'t amazing, but it works just well enough for the average person. And add to that the lightweight, and the Airpods are winners in my book. Well-done Apple.', 'This is the third order of AirPod pros I’ve boughten with this seller. The airpods are 100% legit and go above and beyond my expectations. There are so many cool things you could do with them and the battery life is amazing. I’ve gone with both airpods in my ears for 6 hours before they died which is what I love. Runner up to these would probably be the Powerbeats pro which are more suitable for exercising and I recommend if you excercise a lot and love bass. I love these because of the noise cancellation. Almost as if you’ve gone deaf lol. Would 100% buy again. I’ve boughten these for my mother and aunts and myself and we all feel the same in regards to how great they are!', \"I upgraded from 1st gen to 2nd gen and find no difference at all. I'm not sure what was behind the advertising system of apple, but they shouldn't have name them differently. However, this is not the case with the air pod pro. THis is a HUGE upgrade from the both past airpods. The most notable update is the noise canceling, and I'm wondered how the apple engineers did it with this quaility. I used to use my sony earphones and jbl ones, and they sometimes produce wrong noise and added noise instead of reducing it. Apple did a great job and it helps me concentrate on my job during the time I'm commuting in metro. Absolutely recommend it and will replace all old airpods of my family.\", 'I bought these “USED LIKE NEW” however they came filthy with ear wax or some sort, seems that it wasn’t inspected properly or carelessly graded as a “used like new”item also it was missing the ear tips. amazon description used like new “item will come in original packaging, packaging will be damaged” description didn’t meet my expectations I was truly disappointed with this transaction. After careful sanitization of the item I needed to test the performance of these it turns out that the battery drains quickly and the sound quality was poor especially bass tones making my experience even worst hence my review and rating !', 'Perfection. Honestly though these are the best little wireless earphones and a big upgrade from the 1st generation of AirPods. They curve way more, have different earbud sizes to help with comfort and battery life of the case is AMAZING!! Not to mention you can charge it with a charging pad! Literally just place the case on the charging pad and BOOM, charges! But it also does come with a wire to charge. Also did I mention the noise cancellation setting is awesome?? Well it is, and perfect for zoning in work or meditating. My boyfriend has the new wireless beats and I prefer my AirPods over them because they are more dainty and stay in place with my small ears.', \"Like so many other apple products, apple Airpods pro do not play well with others unless you happen to have a little apple logo on you.  For a Samsung user they are little better than a cheap pair of knock-offs,  Apple chooses to restrict their software to apple-only platform so you can not control the airpods on an android phone.  What you are left with is a pair of VERY expensive earbuds that don't even offer a basic control app.  Unless you are an apple user, spend your money else-ware. Apple has always been about controlling the market and and their customer base. It had been a long time since I tried an apple product and it will be a long time coming.\", \"So I purchased these for my wife and shortly after we got into an argument.  I had asked her question and she didn't answer me.  Time goes on into the evening and I can't possibly think of a reason why she would ignore me.  I did not know she had put her airpods in and was listening to a book.  I asked her, are you mad at me because I asked you a question and she looked at my like a deer in headlghts.  In order to prove her innocents, she allowed me to try them out and sure enough, you cannot hear someone talking in the background. Great quality and great purchase.\", 'I got scared to purchase this bc of some the negative reviews but I’m glad that I stood my ground and decided to buy them bc they work great for me and the price was phenomenal. I mainly bought these bc of the noise canceling so if that’s not your main reason for getting these then you could probably get better headphones for your money. The battery life is about 4 to 5 hrs (it matters if you are using noise canceling) so if you longer lasting ear buds and care a lot about sound quality then try looking for other earbuds atleast in my opinion. These are my first AirPods so I can’t relate them to the old ones but the sound quality seems normal for earbuds in this price range and they are really easy to use. Hopefully this helps someone.', 'I have AirPods already and love them, so I decided to get some for a birthday present. I thought they were new in box and the packaging seemed authentic but when we went to pair them they were already named “Nancy’s AirPods”- Nothing worse than looking like a cheapskate or having to try to explain “Who is Nancy?” to the receiver of the gift! please mention that these are factory refurbished or returns in description and make sure you reset them before shipping them out.', \"These hurt so badly after ~15 minutes.  I've tried all three head sizes.  They all hurt.  They really, really hurt.  I have small ears (I guess?) and I've had problems with other earbuds, but this is the first time I've had a problem with Apple earbuds and also one of the absolutely most painful products I've ever tried. I'm going back to my very comfortable regular Air Pods, but I'm just so baffled by the shape of these.  I see that they have a lot of really good reviews, but I've also googled and I'm very far from the only person having this issue.  If you have small ears or have trouble with earbuds being too big on a regular basis, you may want to avoid these.\", \"When I opened the package, it seems to be used with fingerprints. Airpods have rough unfitted edge. I'm not sure it is new condition nor real deal. I am so disappointed in this purchase as I was so excited. I am returning them and will purchase them at the staples for the same price and new genuine products.\", 'I have had the airpod pros now for close to a year. Bought and shipped by Amazon prime. Few things that made it worth my money, -  (Multiple ear tips) -  (Noise Cancellation/Transparency mode) -  (Does not fall out of your ears as much as other in ear headphone I tried) I wear these atleast 5 times a day for meetings off of my iphone and macbook pro (seamless integration) as well as the gym/hikes/runs 3-4 times a week. They rarely fall off and if they do its because I was sweating a hurricane. I can rarely justify my apple purchases given the competition, but I have to say that these are stellar! Go for it.', 'These are ok, probably overpriced for what you get. My expectations were a bit high for the product, I didn’t expect the Amazon earbuds to have better sound and better noise cancellation at 100$ less Pros: Apple integration, small size of the case (other ear buds have cases that fit uncomfortably in pockets), light weight where you can forget they are there. Can recognize whenever I try voice commands. Good audio quality for talking on the phone. Cons: Sound quality seems mediocre, maybe even bad. Noise cancellation feels like it’s always on.  The price is high for the sound quality.', 'I’ve used Bose noise cancelling headphones for years, particularly during the hour while I prep dinner after a long day with my kids and I just need a little quiet and while flying. I was hesitant to try these, but I can attest to the noise canceling feature being just as great - if not greater - than my Bose. I love how intuitive these are and how well they fit in my ears without hurting. I’ve had them a couple months now and am really happy with their performance.', 'I really like these Apple AirPod Pros.  The sound quality is exceptional.  But, even better is the noise cancelling / transparency mode option.  True to Apple products, they just work… and work well.  No problems connecting, no loss of connectivity, and no sound or static interference.  I was surprised that they fit so well, and hold in place.  They feel like an extension of my iPhone to myself, and work seamlessly across apps.  I really like them.', 'Apple truly has the worst customer service.  I got these air pods for Christmas and the left one stopped working.  I just spent over two hours on chat and on the phone, sending photos, serial number and everything else they asked for and the end result is that they refused to replace them without driving over an hour to the nearest Apple store.  I am done with Apple and the thousands of dollars I have spent.  This is a ear bud, not a Ferrari, thanks for the worst service I have received in a decade.', 'When Apple released the AirPods Pro, the clamor was about Active Noise Cancelling features. Let me tell you, while that mode is great, the transparency mode is the killer feature.  In transparent mode, you can have the AirPods in and hear your music while STILL hearing the surrounding sounds - no its not just muffling through - the technology actually amplifies the outside sounds and blends them perfectly with the music/audio you have playing - think of it as having a radio on in the background while you are listening to a lecture.  Excellent quality - as always for Apple - great battery life and charging case.  Try out the transparency mode - its an amazing feature.', \"It worked well and good in the beginning, but less than two months after purchase -- when the return policy had conveniently expired -- all sorts of problems began.  For example, even though the case is fully charged, one of the pods (right) only works half of the time; when I open the case near the phone, it used to display the battery life, now that once nifty and helpful feature has stopped; sometimes it won't even connect to my iphone's bluetooth at all; and even though the case's battery life was very long as described (several days), already I need to make sure it's fully charged every day.  In short, one big --  and for the price-tag, unexpected -- headache.\", 'My wife and I both own the pros. She has had to return them once in first six months and I have had to return them 3 times in the first 8 months. My right quit, then both were having connection issues, and then I had left connection issues. Apple customer service is great of course, I had replacements in 2 business days (they also cross-ship for a deposit), but I definitely would not buy them again due to durability. They sound amazing, calls are crystal clear, and they are very comfortable - but they just keep crapping out on us. We are very careful with them, always place them back in the case after removing from our ears...', \"These were great until they started having a crackling sounds. I got a replacement pair under warranty. Then crackling sounds started again, new replacement. Then crackling sound again, new replacement. 4th time (!) crackling sounds again, this time 1 year and 1 month after purchase, so Apple won't cover it and offered a repair for $280. Ridiculous. I've been handling these carefully, no drop, no immersion. This is just poor quality. I'll stay away from these moving forward\", 'I was really excited to get these AirPod Pros after the review I saw online and on YouTube. These reviewers were paid for sure. I hate these fake review people. The sound quality is really bad, like a tin can. End classical music is bad on them. I have the old AirPods also, and they have better sound quality. Also, when I am walking outside people complain about the background noice when I used these AirPod Pros, like my Bose Free Sound Sports. They do not complain about background noise when I use the old AirPods. Fit: Good Noise Cancelation: Great Background noise on calls: BAD Sound \"Quality\": BAD Battery life: Short 2.5 hrs', 'I got these to use at work, i’m a technician in the alarm industry and they work absolutely great! The noise transparency and noise cancellation features are awesome and the other features like auto pause when you remove one, the button to pause on the headphones, and just the little details are cool. Battery life isn’t the best for the headphones but the case stays charged for a good bit and charges them fast! Overall great purchase and highly recommend!', 'I bought these to upgrade from my previous pair of AirPods and am blown away by the noise cancellation. I mow with them on and all I can hear is what sounds like someone whisking up cake batter in a stainless steel bowl. When I walk the dog I turn on transparency so I can hear oncoming vehicles from the rear. As usual apple put out a superior upgrade to an already fantastic sounding headset. I don’t think the battery lasts as long as the standard model, but that is to be expected.', \"Some issues with audio de-syncing, left and right earbud not producing sound at same cadence which is jarring. fixed by putting earbuds back in case to re-sync them - happens very rarely May be an issue with my non-apple phone, but the range on the device seems to get interrupted and I experience skips frequently when I am out running or riding a bike, with my phone either on my person, in a bag or nearby - You are paying more for these than the competition Get a case for them if you're as clumsy as me\", 'As usual, Apple has recognized the importance of user experience and how the ideal experience can help to amplify what might be considered average performance when features are considered side-by-side. The noice cancelling isn’t as good as the Bose QC line of products, the sound quality isn’t exceptional, and the battery life won’t last you all day — but in aggregate, this is a fantastic product.', 'Air Pods died immediately (right ear works fine but left ear dies after 20 minutes) I had to call Amazon, then talk to Apple customer service, then had to go in person to Apple store.

PURCHASE THESE FROM THE APPLE STORE IN PERSON - DON\\'T PURCHASE THROUGH AMAZON!!', \"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend's birthday and she really enjoys them. Since she has been working exclusively from home since the pandemic, they have been her go to for daily conference calls and listening to music while working. Both her personal and work phones are iPhones, so the interface works perfectly. For comparison, i have a pair of Sony WH-1000X3's. While I love them for the quality, the interface is no where as smooth as the AirPods Pro when it comes to interfacing with both my iPhone and my iMac. Another great features is the multiple sized earpieces. This has allowed her to really customize the fit of them and maximize sound quality and comfort. The only complaint she has had is that she wishes the battery life lasted longer as they cannot make it through multiple daily conference calls. I recommend this product, especially for anyone already using apple products throughout their daily life.\", \"Sound quality was good but not impressive.  Volume level seemed very limited and I'm not even a fan of very loud db's.  Fitment is horrible.  Do not stay in the ear with any fitting, twisting or pushing; literally just fall out after the slightest bump or movement.  Also the final deal breaker is paying 200$ for an incomplete product...no means of charging the unit out of the box.  A lightning to usb-c is included but no block.  I don't own a usb-c block or wireless charging pad.  Ridiculous a product us sold incomplete at this level.\", \"The Apple AirPods Pro deliver impressive sound. This is especially true of the low end...the bass response out of these ear buds is rich and full-bodied. Orchestra strings are bright and overall the sound is fa more than what you might have expected. Now, the bad part. If only Apple's design had been more suited for the world-wide variety of ear shapes, especially the ear canal. These $245 ear buds simply will not stain place in my ears. I would have sent them back, but I love the sound too much. So, I keep sticking them back in my ears and try not to move.\", 'This is the most expensive pair of head phones I’ve ever bought. This is also the worst pair of headphones I’ve ever bought. Sound quality is great! The problem? Half the time they don’t charge right. Either only one of them charges, and the other one doesn’t. Many times I listen to just one because for some strange reason, one of two won’t charge. I took it to Apple and they gave me a new charging case. Still did not fix the issue. Connection to your iPhone works 75% of the time. Sometimes one is out of sync with the other. They also don’t stay in your ears. As long as you don’t blink, talk, or move, they may stay in your ear. God forbid you try to push them back into your ear, and it stops the audio you’re listening to because you touch them. So, if your a cadaver that doesn’t move and doesn’t mind listening to one head phone… save your money, and go to 5 & Below and get something equivalent that if it does fall out of your ear &  down a drain, you’re only out $5.', \"I was so upset when my old first generation air pods were dying out on me, so I went searching to replace them. I workout and run with my airpods a lot, so it's important that they can sustain a full workout or run and my old ones would die out so quickly. In about an hour or less, which was very frustrating. I was tired of it. So I got these and I do not regret this purchase at all! The noise cancellation feature is very awesome! I can hear things so clearly and with quality sound. I am so happy my battery for my airpods doesn't die when I'm running anymore. Thank you all so much! I am in love with them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\", \"I have used Bose earbuds for quite a while, but decided to try the Air Pod Pros.  They are uncomfortable after only a short while, the sound is okay, but they have a tendency to fall out unless I poke them back in all the time, the charge time is shorter than I expected, the case is slippery and awkward to open/close and you have to pay attention to get the buds to slip back into the case properly.  They're okay, but I am seriously afraid that I will just lose one - and then what?  If I had it to do again, I would buy Bose.\", 'I was kind of hesitant to order these because of some of the bad reviews about some people receiving fake Air-pods or Empty Boxes but I went ahead and ordered these and I am glad I did. I received real air-pods and they work great! The sound is awesome and the battery life seems to last forever!! I did not know that you need a special cord to \"charge these\".

These checked every box, including smooth integration with my iPhone X, Siri, sound quality...i should’ve saved myself the time and returns and purchased these to start with.

Well done.', 'Bought a new pair of Airpods Pro in April 2021. I loved them for about 3 weeks and then they stopped charging in the case. I took them in for repair, and had the case replaced (but not the headphones themselves) in May. Then the same problem recurred in June - cannot charge one of the Airpods. Apple replaced one Airpod. Same problem again in October, and this time I was forced to send them away for repair. I sent them away on Oct 19 for a 3-5 DAY repair and here I am 3 WEEKS later and due to \"labor shortages\" they have no idea how long it will be. So I spend $215 for about 6 months of use. Don\\'t bother.', \"I really wanted to like these.  Unfortunately, they don't charge evenly.  The left ear doesn't hold a charge and continuously drops the connection.  This is very frustrating given the cost of these and how new they are.  I don't recommend purchasing these until there's a marked improvement.  Unfortunately, I can't return them as it's been about 2 months.  On a positive note, when they are connected and functioning correctly, they sound great, they're comfortable and the noise cancelling is pretty impressive.  I'm bummed they don't work or perhaps I just got a defective set. Either way I'm stuck and now looking for a replacement headset.  Good Luck!\", 'Wow. I had no idea that the canals that go from the outer air to my ear drum were sized differently. But they are and the different sized rubber caps on the air pods made this work for me. Here is what would happen. I would have both AirPods in and only one of them, always the right-ear AirPod, would work its way out and fall out. I changed the rubber cap to a smaller version and the problem went away. The noise cancelling is excellent and the ability to hear and be heard during a phone conversation is excellent. Finally, I live in a condo and work from home, and work on an adjoining condo was  making a lot of noise. I put the AirPods in and turned a play list from my iPhone on, and problem solved.', 'I really like these. I like the noise canceling. They were more comfortable in my small ears than the plastic ones. But a couple weeks ago I started getting a lot of interference in the right earbud.

Expensive garbage in my opinion', 'This is the most money I have ever spent on headphones and these are the worst headphones I have ever bought. Unfortunately, I have had them too long to send back or they would be going back. They will NOT stay in my ears. I have tried every size of ear bud sent with them. They absolutely will not stay in. I have talked to several people at my job that had bought these same headphones. They all have sent theirs back for the very same reason. They horribly designed I guess.', 'Bought a new set for my wife as the family dog chewed up one of her other ones definitely hated buying another set at the cost of them but if the wife isn’t happy nobody is happy. They have the same quality and sound you would expect from Apple with the same over priced tag.  Fast shipping great packaging', 'I have a pair of AirPod 2 and these blow them out of the water.  Noise cancellation is incredible, sound quality is excellent and the pairing with my Apple products was very simple. First time using them, I was instantly impressed with the noise cancellation.  It was like all the sound left the room.  It’s great to block at distractions at the office.  I’ll be looking forward to quiet airline travel in the future. Changing the earpiece was a little nerve racking the first time, you feel like your being to rough, but it as designed and things will hold together fine.  Charging is decent, I have not used them for more than a couple hours at a time, but it seems like you should get several hours on a charge. The rubber ear piece and new design makes these feel much more secure, and I don’t feel like I’m in constant danger of losing them like I did with the 2nd gen. Much better for active people. Recommend these to anyone in the market.', 'Product does not stay in your ears if you’re talking, eating, or in general. This is because of the silicon in ear “grips”. There are other type of ear grips sold online from other shops that do a way better job than the default Apple ones. Noise cancellation isn’t as good as others. The best quality I could say about this product is the batter life and the portability. I prefer the Sony WH-1000XM3 over these for comfort, ease of use and REAL noise cancelling.', 'Exactly what they say they are. Wife had had them over a year. She complained about the generation before these cuz they didn’t stay in. She has not with these. Word of advice but I case that you can latch them on to something. Too many times she had nearly lost them. “Find my” app only points location is where they were last and not current location. So “play a song” doesn’t quite work as expected like it does with iwatch ipad etc', 'These are life changing. I cannot stress this enough. I live in a very busy condo building and my neighbor is blasting his bass music as I type this and after 8-9 complaints and NO resolution I felt like I had to do something: in walk Apple AirPod PRO and I do not hear a single bit of noise. I snagged these on sale on a whim and thought, Well what do I have to lose. I couldn’t be more pleased!!! I wish I knew about HOW good these are years ago.', 'Bought it for my partner. Said that the spatial audio is really good. The transparency mode is the best. You can listen to music and have a conversation with someone and hear both the music and the person crystal clear.  The only reason it isn’t a 5/5 is because it doesn’t allow you to do the tap controls like the previous versions. Sometimes by pressing the stalks you lose the seal in the ear. But that’s minor just to get used to how to do it. It’s a fantastic device.', 'I got these on sale and they rock. Admittedly I didn’t understand what noise canceling was. I thought it just meant the sound of your media blocked on sound but I was pleasantly surprised when I found out it was way more than that and absolutely awesome. I highly recommend these. Sound quality is great and the sound canceling is awesome. Battery life is exactly what i need also. I did buy these on sale however for $170 I believe. I think whenever Apple is about to announce their new models the current one goes on sale and that’s the best time to pick them up! My only wish is when you dropped the case I wish there was a better way to lock the case because if you drop them 100% of the time the ear buds will launch out of the case.', 'I wasn’t sure if I’d like these because I wondered if they were more of a novelty. But to my surprise, I really do like them! A lot! They are VERY good at cancelling out the noise. My son is on a bowling league and I used them while he was bowling, to watch a video, and it was perfect! The one thing that I really wanted these for is for working out. I was concerned that they might not stay in my ears once I got sweaty. They have fallen out a couple of times but it could’ve been my fault. Maybe they weren’t pushed in far enough? I’m not sure. They’re very simple to use and have great sound quality. I also like that you can use just one air pod at a time if you want to. And the battery life seems to be for quite awhile, although, I haven’t timed it or used them from charged up to dying yet.', \"Positives: Great Sound. Amazing technology. Right out of the box it linked with my iPhone without having to do anything. Incredible! Negatives: The Pro will not stay in my ears. I tend to dance and move around a lot. This would cause these ear buds to fall out. My SkullCandy stay in better than this. The material they chose to keep this in the ear was not their smartest idea. Hopefully I can buy an adapter to make a bigger difference. Overall: Would not buy them again. I love the sound and tech, but if it doesn't stay in my ears when I move around, then what is the point?\", 'Airpods work very well with the IPhone. Seemlessly across the IPad and Iphone. The noise cancelleation is excellent. Battery life is not so great. Recharging in the case is pretty cool, but would like to see another 3 hours of life on these. I get a max of 3 hours use on these. By far the best feature is the sound.', 'These AirPods Pro are nice sounding earbuds however the part that goes into your ear canal needs a redesigning. I tried all three sized tips on multiple occasions and turned in multiple different directions but could not get them to stay in my ears. I’m very active and need something I don’t have to worry about falling out AND LOSING!  These definitely don’t fit that bill. They must work for others but I don’t know how they could work well for someone always working around the house on house projects.', \"I love everything about these except that they are so easy to lose.  Sometimes they fall out and if I'm feeding horses and it's muddy I may lose one (or both) forever. So I bought a connector but it sits over the microphones so I can't talk on the phone with the connector - kind of defeats the purpose.  Hoping Apple comes up with a better option but for now, I am grateful I haven't lost them (or the case which I've now added a tile to).\", 'I tried cheaper ear buds and they did not fit comfortably , poor sound, and could not keep them seated in my ears. I finally stepped up and bought these. They are not exceptional in any category, but they fit, sound good, and stay in my ears. I used them while flying and the noise cancellation worked fine. I can talk and hear voice calls fine. The music quality is enjoyable. I use them in conjunction with my Apple watch and Apple phone. The lack of volume control on the buds themselves is not a problem. (less taps to deal with when working with them.) The over all volume does not go as high as I would expect, but more than enough for me.', \"They don't appear as a headset for Windows, and the sound lags by about twenty seconds. I must always to restart into macOS to participate in Zoom meetings. Might just be a BootCamp-thing since Apple has not updated their BootCamp Support Software in about four years. Works wonderfully with Apple devices, and even my LG TV, too! Fantastic except that they're completely useless in Windows. I encourage you to checkout the Feedback Hub in Windows 10 to see what I'm talking about.\", \"PROS: These are the best in-ear earbuds I have ever had. I typically do not like earbuds because they usually fall out, they don't have the best sound quality, and they never have noise-cancellation. The Apple AirPods Pro happens to address all of these issues. It also is great for when you're working in the office because you can turn on a mode that allows for noise-cancellation but will isolate voices. You probably won't be able to understand them, but you'll be aware they're talking and then you can pause your music or podcast through your device or through the AriPods themselves. CONS: The AirPods charging dock/case is excellent but somewhat prone to damage and is fragile. I would recommend getting a case to put around it. Also, don't expect the noise cancellation to be on par with your over-ear Bose or Sony headphones, but it is still excellent.\", 'I really hesitated buying these because of the price... but let me tell you they were worth EVERY PENNY! I live in a neighborhood that seems to be really obsessed with home improvement and lawn care. After weeks of working from home (thanks covid) and listening to the constant lawn mower, chain saw, drills, etc... I thought I was going to absolutely lose my isshh. Along came these headphones.. they work amazing! I had the skull candy ones before this and they were not near as comfortable, plus they didn’t have the noise cancellation ability. Thanks to these headphones I’m back to living in peace.', 'Good: form factor, instant connect easy to put on. Sounds okay not exceptional pairs well with windows. Noise cancellation is so so. Call clarity from other side is good battery life fine not sure if it is as advertised. Bad: noise cancellation is not the best there are better, sounds not a wow. Slips out of my ear fear of disappearing after the fall, no volume control on ear tips , I do get ear fatigue after long wear', \"Sound quality is very good. Could be better with ear tips that don't slip. That is my main beef with these. They were fine for a week, then I started having re-seat them frequently. The left side just falls out at times. I have the non-pro Airpods also. No complaints. I also own four IEM wired earphones. No problems with seal, etc. On the plus side, the pros are very easy to set up and work well while sitting still in a chair or laying on the bed. Just have to keep pushing them back in.\", \"I was hesitant to buy this because of the price. I waited and waited and finally I pull the trigger and got the upgrade and I'm so happy and satisfied with he quality and everyday I can used them without headaches. I'm able to switch from Phone to tablet quick and easy. When I do my work on my Pc I have connect it every time but that was expected since I'm mostly connected to my phone or tablet. The Quiet mode is fantastic! My head is like in a bubble and all surrounding noise just fades away. Comfort level is high, even fallen asleep with them on.\", 'Three star because I have a heck of a time keeping these in my ears. I’ve tried all the cups and they all fall out too easy. If I bend over, jump or sometimes just walk, they slip out. You have to really jam these into your ears! While I like the idea of individual ear phones, the cost and hassle is just not worth it. I like the types that have an ear clip that goes over the ear to hold it in place. I’m a very active person and need to know the thing isn’t going to fall out.', 'I bought my first pair and they were amazing for two weeks and so I bought a second pair. Right *after* I bought the second pair the first pair went entirely wonky. The sound started to crackle, one ear stopped working intermittently, and then finally noise cancellation quit entirely. I could not return pair 1 and pair 2 fast enough, and now it seems the problem is widespread.  I would avoid until they have a gen 2 version.', \"This is more a comment on Amazon than on the Airpods. During setup, the airpods connected as expected, but they were named with someone's (Abelson) email address. The packaging was new, and everything look fine, but I've lost confidence in Amazon for this deceptive practice. It's OK to sell used products, just label them as such. Reguarding the Airpod pros, I've compared them with similar products from 1More and Cambridge. Both of those are around $100. In terms of ease of use - connecting, dropped signal, phone calls - the Pro wins. In terms of sound quality, the Airpod pro was a close second to 1More, which felt fuller andre comanding than the AirPod pro.\", 'Worth every penny if you’re an Apple user. I can seamless switch between my iPhone, Apple Watch, and iPad. If I remove an ear bud, it pauses my video automatically. The option to switch between noise cancelling and regular is perfect. Only complaint is not with the product itself but that it isn’t comparable with Teams or certain other Microsoft based products. I really wanted to use these for my work meetings but they meet my needs everywhere else.', \"Great great product. Non biased to being an apple lover. I would say this is an amazing pair of headphones with great sound quality and noise cancellation, only draw back for me, is that having never owned any of the previous airpods I didnt know they dont stay in air during intense workouts or runs. So with this pair I thought ok it should stay and fit great etc, but on my 1st workout it fell out even with a perfect fit test. So I got myself some rubber accessories to wrap around my ear to workout with but with Alot of sweat they to slip off the ear and the airpods will fall. So if you're going to use these to workout, know the limits unless they absolutely dont fall out for you. Everything else though, is excellent\", 'I have always been an \"armchair audiophile\" who spends more than most people for high quality sound. With time, I have come to appreciate that small trade-offs in ultimate sound quality for the sake of convenience can be worthwhile. Generally, I use these while fast walking and exercising... but I have often found myself listening at my computer instead of turning on the amplifier and speakers because they sound good. They are also hassle free when reviewing music to download. Highly recommended.', 'So I just received my AirPods and there is a cord for charging but no wall charger. I not a fan of Apple products, but my daughter got these for her Bday and said they were great at noise cancellation and I need something like these for work. I do not want to wear a headset. I have the Samsung Galaxy buds and they do not cancel out the noise of me typing so I thought that I would try these. So now I have to order a wall charger and wait till that comes before I can use these! (does not say the wall charger is not included) Not a happy camper. Another reason not to like Apple!', 'Small sleek design with awesome aftermarket cases available. mobi case with caribeener clip hooks on my belt loop and slides into front pocket for easy access. Although sometimes forget their attached to my jeans I put them through the wash:-( I bought the extended warranty through Amazon and am writing this review because I can’t find where this is redeemed and will update this review once found.', \"For once I can comfortably wear in ear earbuds that won't bother my ears. The auto air pressure adjusting thing is sensational and incomparable. Say what you want to say, but AirPods Pro have turned me into an iPhone user and now I'm considering a MacBook Pro as a go to work horse. It's a magical experience that compensates well for the switch and I'm willing to go through the struggle of converting library of windows based projects to MacOS so I can enjoy these experiences even more. :D From wireless charging to small casing that fits in that weird jean pocket I always criticized and now know what it's for. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY STYLE.\", 'The changeable tips are great, but the actual ear piece is too big for my ears. They fit, but when I wear them for too long, it hurts some of the cartilage of my upper ear. If you want to know exactly where, it\\'s the inner part of where you\\'d get a \"daith\" piercing. If I keep them still, i don\\'t notice the pain, but if I am working out and have to push the earbuds back in or readjust them, it hurts. And I also notice scabs on that spot that hurts after overdoing it for a few days. The earbuds functionality is great though. So as long as ear size works, these are excellent.', \"Returned. It wouldn't stay in my ears.\", 'I had the old AirPods prior to these. Not to sound dramatic, but the noise cancellation changed my life. I have social anxiety and also hate loud noises or loud busy places. I put these in everywhere I go just to use the noise cancellation feature. It has made going grocery shopping so much easier. I wish I had bought these as soon as they were released. The music quality is amazing. I can wear them for hours and have no inner ear pain whatsoever. I used the standard size for the ear portion. The battery life is amazing. They are so worth the money.', 'I use Apple devices and these AirPod Pros connect seamlessly. They are very comfortable barely noticeable to wear. With noise canceling off it is easy to hear conversations so they do not have to be removed to hear the dinner bell. I haven’t used noise canceling. The sound is very good, but a tad light on bass compared with my Bose over-the-ears headphones. That’s not a game-changer for me. Much more comfortable than the Bose. Batter life is very good too.', \"So I honestly thought these headphones would have amazing sound quality for the pricetag on them. Generally, the noise cancellation is pretty good - but let's be honest; I am not paying just south of $250 for AirPods that literally sound exactly like the headphones that come with an iPhone. They sound exactly like the headphones that come with the phones these days - just with noise cancellation. Save your money.\", 'These are the absolute best product on the market, compared to other brands, they are overall the best. They have the best sound quality, fantastic noise cancellation, and the absolute highest durability. They are easy to find with the find my iPhone app and a companion like tile. They are definitely worth the money in the long run, as they are extremely high-quality and efficient. Battery life is outstanding and the earbuds charge extremely fast, at a percent per 2 seconds; and they last hours. Alsi, this listing had them being sold as cheap as a refurbished pair but they are brand new, with the actual refurbished pair being sold at $10 less.', \"I'm not allergic to anything. Never have been... But something about these AirPods Pro made my ears an itchy, oozing mess. Tried new ear tips and everything I could think of, and came to the conclusion that it's the Class 1 (strongest) bluetooth radiation that's the problem. Great range, and loved everything else about them, but can't use them, to my great disappointment. They're the best earbuds I've ever used, and I miss them every day! 5 stars for everything except the high radiation that caused the irritation and temporary hearing-loss.\", 'I did not like that I ordered the Apple IPod Pro but, received the IPod 3rd generation.  My fault that I didn’t realize it until I went to wrap it.  also don’t like that it was received by Amazon on December 16th but, I have not heard a thing.  I have called once already.  I spend a lot of money here and would appreciate knowing what is going on.  I already ordered the correct Pro since I needed it for a gift.', 'Transparency mode might be the reason I Bought these! I’m mostly deaf in my right ear and ironically that just so happens to be the ear that doesn’t properly fit, it is the only one that has loosened up and at times fallen out of my EAR! doesn’t matter which size attachment I use S,m,l.  So..... I do recommend if you’re going to buy these, get the apple Care+ for $30.   Other than that they are pretty amazing! Since I don’t hear very well and I want to listen/ watch a movie with my kids as I’m doing other things without Me turning the Tv volume up, I just use transparency mode or i can turn ‘live listen’ on my phone and leave it by the tv! It uses your phone’s microphone and transfers it to the ear pods.  I used them as ear plugs the other day when Using my leaf blower! I started with transparency mode on listening to music. I could definitely hear the music and absolutely the blower! When I turned transparency mode off, I was in a whole new world! It cut the outside sound by more than half.!  So with voice activation and more it’s just the beginning! They sync with my phone easy, even in my car audio system with Alexa and apple car play, along with everywhere else! So explore and and enjoy a sound amazing to me and even more who can Hear with or without them.', \"I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of technology Apple was able to pack into these little things. I am not an audiophile but I have owned Bose QC35 for a few years. I was looking to replace it with something more compact. Sound quality is comparable to the Bose ones although Bose does a better job of noise cancelling. I like that I can wear these even in sleep whereas wearing the Bose headphones would've been impossible. Battery life is yet to be tested but it does seem to take about 30 minutes to fully charge from 0. Wireless charging capability is nice and will work with pretty much any Qi charger. My only complaint is that the case attracts finger prints and smudges.\", \"I love these noise cancelling and immersive-sound quality earphones. Imagine having noise cancelling headphones being this small. I have been wanting to have these in the past year however I just got them couple days ago. I love it. Sound quality, noise cancellation and battery life are amazing. I just have my regular airpods handy just incase I need an extra set of wireless earphones. It's a good buy and I highly recommend this.\", 'Don’t buy this product!!! Is so weird but The box doesn’t include the adapter to charge it, just has a case and cable (but no regular cable) you need to buy the adapter separate!!!  To bad for Apple and Amazon', 'Bought this for my dad. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with a USB C charging brick and his iPhone charging brick has a USB A (the regular, well adopted USB type) port. Out of principle I’m going to 1 Star this. Apple has really been disappointing me lately with their nickel and diming nonsense.', 'I bought these as an upgrade to the standard airpods. The biggest loss from the “upgrade” is the tap feature. I wear these for working out so being able to just tap my ear twice to skip the song or pause was great. In the pros you have to double click a button and more than a few times I have not pressed it right. Definitely a first world problem, but it’s still a downgrade from the original airpods. The noise pass through is okay at best, I was not blown away. It seems to randomly choose noises to pass through. The noise cancellation is ehh, I am a little biased because I’m comparing it to Bose over the ear noise cancellation. Of course that’s better but when I pay for Apple products I just expect more. Overall, if you haven’t had the original airpods these are probably going to be amazing to you, but if you bought it as an “upgrade” you may be displeased. A positive is they are still light and not too noticeable, great for working out. PSA: I see too many people carrying the case around. I feel like they don’t know the headphones don’t need the case to connect to the phone. Hope this helps at least one person not have to carry the case around the gym.', 'When I received these ear plugs Apple sent a charging cord with it.  The cord had yet a different plug that was needed to charge this device.  No electrical plug was included that could be used for this \"new\" plug.  You had to purchase that separately.  I am tired of Apple doing this.  They change their plugs so that you have to go out and buy new ones.  Considering the company is doing so great, the least they could do is send the electric plug as an included item.', \"I was sure I would get these and return them due to poor fit and sound quality. I was never able to use the ear buds that came with my new phones they would not stay in my ears even just sitting still let alone moving around. I was blown away by the snug comfortable fit and clear clean sound that these air pods produced. I am very happy with all aspects of this set of air pods. Noise cancelation is good but I have been spoiled by my Bose QC 3 headphones. But its is more than fair noise reduction and I would recommend these to anyone, The transparency mode is great it lets in the outside noise but still allows you to hear what's going on around you. Overall great air pods and well worth the money spent.\", \"Really am getting a lot of use out of these pods.  Fit is O.K. -- just O.K.  Durability is excellent.  Noise cancelling is effective but no where near the silence inside my Bose headphones.  Audio fidelity is also acceptable.  Blue Tooth is wonky, but it's hard to assign that fault solely to the pods, the other devices that I use them with share the responsibility.  They do, however, work flawlessly with my other Apple devices.  Glad I got them.  Would buy again.\", 'Had Bose Q20 in ear noise cancelling earbuds which I LOVED but my dog chewed them up.  So I figured after 4+ years the wireless tech would have improved.  And is has!  These are every bit as good as the Q20s I had before.  Very compact and easy to charge.  They have about 30% less battery life but I’ll gladly trade that for no wires!  Fit is great.  Did notice if you don’t have the right size inserts the performance is significantly degraded so make sure to get the right ones for the best fit. Overall very impressive.', \"I upgraded from on older pair of AirPods and I am very impressed. Sound quality is great and  I really like the noise cancelling feature on these. I had them on watching a program on my iPhone. I was in the same room with my husband who was watching a program on tv and I could not hear the TV at all.  I also like that you can wear one at a time.  I do wish the battery lasted longer, but wearing one earbud at a time and swapping them out when the battery runs out in one, I still am able to listen to music, audiobooks or podcasts all day long. The only thing I'm not happy about is that the give you a charging cord that has a USB-C Connector but they don't include the charger plug adaptor.  I think that is just a way to try and get you to spend more money! I'm not happy about that.  However, they do charge with a regular iPhone lightening charger cord.  So Apple, you won't get any extra money from me.\", 'Seriously... Pro!!! These will be more likely to fall out of your ears than the original AirPods. The noise cancellation is junk! These offer a 5% improvement over the original AirPods if you can get them comfortable. I’m a big Apple fan, and these are close to the worst product I’ve had from them. A joke for the price... after an hour I went back to my original AirPods. Seriously disappointed!', 'I’m sure many people have said these ear buds produce the best sound. Also, the charge lasts a long time. However; I can’t give them 5 stars because I can’t get it out of my mind that one could fall out of my ear and be lost. And that’s a lot of money! My ears are sort of flat, and I have to push them in, and twist. Once in they seem to be in, and they feel fine. But... I don’t really know if the fit is the way it’s supposed to be. I’m keeping them, but in the back of my mind I am not 100% confident.', 'I’d give these a 2.5/5. I wish I were still in the return window. They aren’t that comfortable and I can’t seem to get a good seal on my left ear-I’ve tried different tips. I’d recommend looking for a less expensive alternative because these are definitely not worth it.  I tried a friend’s (not pros) and prefer them to the pros.', '*A review coming from an Android user. -The sound is okay but not better than the Sony wf1000xm3 that I own. -You cannot see the battery percentage. -They were uncomfortable the first week but my ears got used to them. I have small ears. -Noise cancelling is kinda dissapointing, you can still hear a lot of the background. They are pretty good pair of earbuds for everyday use, perhaps pairing it with an iPhone would be a different story.', \"Good sound, good design, impressive noise canceling. Connects properly about 75% of the time. Has trouble being in my pocket or on the ground or pretty much anywhere. They keep stuttering and going out of sync with each other. Only seems to like Apple (tm) chargers. Battery life is anemic, but understandable given the noise cancellation. Worth about 50$ if it was anyone other than Apple. I've had 15$ headphones that performed better and with similar battery life.\", 'Great fearures and sound quality! Unfortunately Apple missed the mark on the eartips. I have no idea how they tested these during the development phase, but they just don’t stay in for more than a few minutes. They slowly start coming out, the next thing you know, you’re picking up your $250 ear pods from the concrete. Tried all sizes, same result. The tips are too short.', 'Originally had the second version of the AirPods and was hoping these would fix my issue with them. They definitely fit and feel better. Battery life is great but the microphone is too sensitive. Every noise is amplified. Annoyingly so. Someone using these and eating anything, or opening a wrapper, or a tv in the background is annoyingly loud on the receiving end. Would not recommend these to anyone unless they want to scratch their ears out with loud sharp noises.', 'It works great! It comes with the AirPods, the charger box, a cable, and rubber earpieces of different sizes. In case you don\\'t have one, you need a \"USB C Wall Charger Adapter\" to charge the AirPods. If an Airpod has more charge than the other, let them run totally out of change and then charge them again so they are even. The sound quality is very good but suddenly the sound quality changed, the issue was that I was using XCode. The fix for this is changing the sound settings to use the Internal Microphone (in your Input tab) of your Mac because by default the AirPods is using its microphone and your computer also is using its microphone then the Bluetooth bandwidth drops and so the sound quality. Also, it feels comfortable in my ears. They are awesome! Love \\'em! 🥳', 'They are larger than expected, even with the smaller cushions. I need to use ear hooks to ensure they don’t fall out. If you have smaller ears purchase the non-pro version.', 'I was on the fence about buying the pros vs regular, and honestly on the fence about buying them at all until I saw them for sale via Amazon. I brought the pros because Apple headphones and my ears have....history. I wanted the different ear tips, and also wanted the noise cancellation. The noise cancellation was incredible as soon as I put them in my ears and the sound was really good, but from there I would spend the next 14 days of my trial period (spoiler: I had to return them) constantly troubleshooting them, fidgeting with them, switching out ear tips and  practically shoving them into my ears. After the initial hour or so with them in I got vertigo from not being used to the pressure and a slight headache, but that wouldn’t last long because these things absolutely refuse to stay in my ears. And I’m not doing any heavy activity, or any activity at all for the matter — I would just be sitting and could feel my ears rejecting them. And the constant adjustments and trying to push them back into my ears made me feel like I was on my way to giving myself an ear infection. The most infuriating was they would pop out while I was trying to talk on the phone and I’d have to go through an ordeal of reconnecting. I saw another upset reviewer saying they don’t understand how these made it through testing, and I’m unfortunately prone to agree. Which is sad because the sound was great — when I could get them to stay in my ears. Nearly $250 is too much for a wireless earbud to nearly catapult itself into dirty sink just because I leaned over a little bit. I ended up downgrading to regular Airpods and am going to try those out for a while. It already seems like a better fit after only one day but...we’ll see....', \"I bought a pair of these for my wife for Christmas. She's not a techie but these connect easily and work well for listening to audio books, music or talking on the phone. She can leave her phone anywhere in the house and walk around without losing the signal. She does get some static if she's near the running microwave while wearing them though. She loves them so I bought a pair for my mom, who also doesn't want something complicated. She also finds these easy to use and loves them.\", \"They are really good headphones, but I couldn't get the seal with the earbuds. With the smallest size they would eventually fall off....and they are extremely expensive for what they are.  Besides that, I also like better with a cable or strap so I can take them off/on and keep them at hand...returned them for a refund and got a pair a Beat Flex instead. It does have really cool functions with different types of noise cancellation, checking if the earbuds seal is right and other stuff...shame.\", \"I tried two pairs thinking the first pair I got was defective, but both sounded tinny with ZERO bass. The sound quality of my original AirPods is 2x better than these. This is the first Apple product I've ever been disappointed with. I will be returning both pairs and looking for other options or will just continue using my 3 year old original AirPods. I'm astounded by how superior the sound is on my originals vs these new AirPod Pros it's not even close\", 'The noise cancelation and all of the features this includes is AMAZING, and its super simple to set up, noise cancelation is amazing, I realized when i was standing next to my air conditioner and everything got silent, once i took off one airpod, then all the sound came back and i realized that these are crazy good. The fits a bit weird on me personally, but its a solid product for sure.', \"Nowhere on the item description page does it say that these are reconditioned ear buds, NOWHERE! They were a gift for my wife and arrived 3 days late, just barely in time for her birthday. Then we find out that it is reconditioned. NOWHERE on the item description page does it say it is reconditioned. We apparently bought someone else's problems because they were defective. The sound cuts in and out and not all the features work.\", \"When I started looking for some bluetooth IEMs, I actually tried a couple other pairs before I went with these. I tried a smaller company that was known for their audio quality the first time around, with roughly the same type of tap buttons on the ears as the airpods. The bluetooth however was absolutely terrible. I ended up returning them and getting a pair of the powerbeats3's for the w1 chip. The bluetooth now was perfect, however the sound quality was absolute garbage and they still had the wire between the ears, which caught on my neck like it was covered in glue. I kept them for the gym, but they still couldn't replace my old wired set I was using to commute and at work. The airpods on paper looked like they could be the ones and I got a pair at the beginning of November. Given what I had dealt with from the prior pairs, they were exactly what I expected when they arrived. The sound quality is fairly average, but given the rest of the features and the solid connectivity of the w1, I could live with it. However, it's been 3 months now and I am starting to see build quality issues. The left one started rattling a couple weeks ago like something was loose. I googled it and it looks like this issue wasn't just me in isolation. Apple was easy to work with. They switched out the left earpod only though, and shortly after the right ear also started to rattle. I would expect better quality. The problem may only hit 1/10 or 1/20 pairs, but given the price point of these I would expect better. I'll update in another 3 or 4 months with the new pair and see if maybe the ones I had were part of a bad batch.\", 'I highly recommend, however I would also suggest getting connecting cord! I love these AirPods but the only reason I can’t give them 5 stars is because they’ve falling out my ears a million times!! The durability of them are out of this world I just knew i would’ve had to replace them by now due to them constantly falling out my ear at 6’0 tall I would have expected them to break or go out But nope they are still in great condition! Great buy but again invest in a connecting cord!', 'Nice. Authentic AirPods. Don’t buy expecting to be able to listen to anything for a long time because I promise either the air pods will be dead or the case will be dead EVERY SINGLE DAY. I don’t even charge my phone as much as I have to charge these air pods. I open them up in the morning to find they’re dead. Charge the case at work I get a good 2-3 hours alternating the pods then find they are all dead AGAIN that very night. Just go buy them From the Apple store because the previous ones I bought did not have this problem.', 'After about four months, they started to make a \"scratching\" sound in the left ear.  Went to Amazon to check out warranty, but since I am four months out they redirect to Apple.  Went to an Apple store, they told me to download app and it would synch the serial number and I could submit a RMA for a replacement, overnight!  Apple App does not pick up the serial number when synched.  So, when purchases made on Amazon do not synch with your Apple account.  Now, made second appointment with Apple store, outsourced to Best Buy because they are overloaded and  website won\\'t schedule appointments further than one week, but due to CV19, no one can get an appointment at an Apple store. Summary: Beware when buying Apple products on Amazon.  They do not synch serial and order information for warranty replacements; unless you pay for the super special extra bonus vip platinum Apple loyalty skymiles fees.  Overrated!!!  Overpriced!!!', \"the product is good but I can't get over the rage I felt when I examined the charging cable that comes with the airpods. one end works, but what good is the other end if it doesn't fit anything i have? absolutely NONE. Apple is about the greediest outfit around. I think i might like the airpods after they charge up. like next week after i acquire the necessary equipment.\", \"I have had regular AirPods for years--they typically run out after 2+ hours so for my marathon I recently ran I saw these had 4+ hours of battery life, and bought them. I had them fully charged. I was listening only to iTunes on my phone (not in the cloud), no calls or anything and they died at the 3 hours mark! Really not much more than my old ones. Don't buy for longer than 3 hours in my experience.\", 'I gave this 2 stars because of the noise cancellation and overall sound quality. Everything else is negative. Do not buy these! Imagine a tapered candle with a tiny rubber nob on the end. Now shove it in your ear. Yup, just like all the AirPod products. Extremely uncomfortable to wear. But the biggest annoyance is that they keep falling out of your ear. Constantly. Even if you are sitting still doing nothing. Bloop! Now you have to look for them. I tried all the sizes of the rubber nobs but nothing helped. All the people who have reviewed these airpod pros and said they stay in while exercising have to be lying. There is just no way. But here is the thing that really makes me angry. Apple is aware of this issue. How do I know? If you’re streaming a movie, and your airpod falls out, the movie is paused. So instead of taking the high road and re engineering the AirPods so they stay in your ear, apple decided to make a software change. And continue to pass on to us a sub par and flawed product. I probably just go back to bose.', 'I’ve tried and owned other wireless buds including Sunsung + and Samsung 2. I had to adjust the EQ setting during the setup process and they sound crisp, clear, and bright. Very surprised and satisfied. Other brands are to bassy and muddy despite their EQ settings or profiles. Additionally, the Air Pods are very light and comfortable whether for an hour or a day. Get them if you want to hear the full range of sound in comfort.', 'I originally purchased a pair of air pods but they did not stay in my ears well. I returned them and purchased  this model. These stay in my ears well and the sound quality is quite good. The longest I have worn them is 3-4 hours and they were comfortable and did not fall out, although I did press them into my ears a few times. The noise cancellation function works pretty well. I would purchase these again.', \"The sound blocking on these things is remarkable to me.  It's like the world just goes away. Battery is absolutely fine for my purposes, and love that you can just charge it with the regular Apple phone charger, so you don't have to remember another cable. Sound is good.  I listen to mostly audiobooks, so I don't get the full benefit.  They are pricey - but ultimately worth it, as long as you don't lose them, which I'm insanely paranoid about. (Where are my other 22 pairs of earbuds?  One wonders ...)\", \"I got the Jabra Elite 75t before thee after some professional reviews. I now think they where paid for their reviews. The apple air pods are far superior in sound quality, call quality, and fit. The transparency mode is almost like not having the earpods in.  Elite 75t sounded like you where listening to amplification through an old radio, and were horrible in the wind. The passive noise reduction is about the same.  And the active noise reduction which Jabra doesn't have is amazing.  Tested it with the microwave vent first. For 3 out of the 4 settings, I could barely tell it was running.  Interestingly eneough it was on setting 3 that I could hear it (must be a frequency thing). Today I tried them on the lawn tractor.  You could definately hear it, but could also hear my podcast at 50% instead of 80-100%. The fit is good and they don't fall out. The only thing that the pro reviewers got right was that the case on the Elite 75t does have a nicer feel/ finish (also like the square bottom). Really the only regret however; is that they only come in white. If you have an Apple phone I would definately reccommend these.\", 'Not sure why I waited so long. They are truly a different generation of headphones in comparison to all competition. The sync with Apple devices make the experience even better. Awesome noise cancellation. And I have never liked any earbuds more than an hour ever...but they are awesome. Almost all day use. Apple hasn’t impressed me with anything in last 6 years. These are good Only downside, battery life... almost considering buying a second pair to swap while it’s charge... zoom calls is life right now.', 'First of all, you’ll need to buy a wall plug to charge these. Why Apple doesn’t include a fundamental piece to charge their devices, I’ll never know but I think it’s pretty sketch. Sound quality is great! Not Bose great but great. They fit and are comfortable. Noise cancellation is an amazing feature! But for reference, I can still hear someone opening a wrapper near me or the microwave beeping with noise cancellation ON while listening to music or a podcast on a medium level.', \"I like the great fit, great noise cancelling, and great controls, there's no pressure while using noise cancelling like other earbuds, minus 1 star is because sometimes it takes too long for the earbuds to detect its in my ear causing incoming calls to be too late to pickup and also for the phone voice quality that I wished to be a bit better. (the switching between modes can stop working although very rarely)\", 'Okay, I am more than pleasantly surprised with these, I am very happy!  Earbuds and me have never gotten along so I was hesitant to buy these, but since I am an Apple fan I gave them a try. My biggest problem with earbuds is that I have small ears, so everything I have tried in the past is either too big and falls out, or hurts my ears after a short time of having them in.  I was worried that would be the case with these, but it’s not.  I also have a couple of inner ear piercings that tend to make ear buds uncomfortable, but these haven’t bothered me at all.  They are very comfortable, stay in, plus the sound quality and noise cancellation is awesome.  10/10 recommend!', 'Loved these while they worked. The left earbud stopped working after six months. Spent over an hour with tech support only to be told I have to go to Best Buy to see if they can fix it (or the Apple Store) before they’ll replace it!!  $170 for six months of enjoyment followed by endless frustration?  DO BETTER APPLE!!!! I’ll never spend another dime on Apple products. BUYERS BEWARE!!!', 'Just received these today. I would give 5 stars if they were a little more comfortable in the ear canal, however they feel similar to the regular ear phones that come with iPhone, except that they have the rubber ear tip that helps with comfort. The shape that Apple makes their ear phones is strange to me and doesn’t fit the ear canal comfortably, however these are tolerable and I’m only deducting the one star for it. Sound quality seems great so far and the noise canceling is great. I wish I had these when I was in nursing school and needed peace and quiet to study!', 'My first pair of Airpods and I love them. I love the noise cancelation, but I also love that I can have these in and still hear everything going on around me if I want. I have them paired with my Work iPhone, my personal phone, a Samsung and my Dell Laptop and they always connect flawlessly. I can switch from each device fairly easy. It has made working from home so much easier. I can go to the gym and completely tune out the world while I exercise. So glad I got these.', 'These sound great and for the most part work well. From an innovator such as Apple I just expect a little more. These are often connecting the the wrong device or not connecting at all and I have to manually select them or disconnect from the wrong device. I know, such an inconvenience, but thats not what I expect when I pay almost $200 for earbuds from Apple. I expect them to work seamlessly with my other Apple devices.', 'Are you weary about reviews? Honestly, let me tell you, these AirPods exceeded my expectations. In the past, I was not too fond of apple headphones and would refuse to buy them because of sound, quality, and the amount of transparency they had. Well when these came out I was still cauitious. Yet I bought them to pair with my watch and iphone. I have to say, the sound quality is amazing! The noise cancelling is so good that I was right next to the DJ booth and I didnt hear the DJ’s music, I only felt the bass hitting the chair I was in. I was in a very crowded environment and in the midst of this environment I didnt hear a single thing except my music playing. 10/10 I love these. I would recommend this to other apple users. I had my doubts given the past but these are so good that I didnt even hear the alexa timer going off in the kitchen and I was in there cooking. If your worried about not hearing anything outside then you could switch to the transpercy mode they have. So I really enjoy you could pick one or the other. 5/5 these are wonderful!', 'DO NOT BUY THESE FROM AMAZON—they will be defective. When I first received this product they seemed to work reasonably well. However, within a month, the battery would drain quickly and on occasion, sound would not come out of one side or the other. Eventually, after a couple months and persistent no sound coming out of the right side, calling Apple technical center, and bringing them in to the Apple store a few times, I found out both ear AirPods were defective. After replacing both ear pods, the sound was a lot more clear, except I continued to have issues with no sound coming from the right one. I brought them back in, they sent them to be repaired. Come to find out, the case had corrosion at the metal near the bottom after my minimal use.', \"I heard and saw lots of comments on how good AirPods Pro is, but from my perspective, it did not reach my expectations. First, I felt like the headphones would drop whenever I wore them. It seemed to me that my ears did not fit them well, so while I was wearing them, I had the feeling that they might just fall down on the ground though they didn't. Second, the noice cancellation that has been over-complimented by many people seemed to work only in spaces that do not contain lots of noice, for instance, your study or the library. Otherwise, you might still hear sounds on the street. However, the transparency mode worked quite well and unique for me though I still can't distinguish what's the difference between turning on the transparency mode and using a bluetooth speaker. This mode allows you to listen both the music and the surrounding voices, so you'll be able to notice what's happening around you while your music is still played. Overall, this is a good apple product, but somehow, it receives too many compliments that I thought it's going to be a wonderful headphones. Well... I'm not really saying this is bad, but rather sharing some of my thoughts here. I hope my sharing would be beneficial to some of you :)\", 'Sound is good, and I love all the features, like transparency (lets EXTRA noise in) so you can work with them in if you need to be able to hear people. I work around loud machinery so the fact that I can go from this mode to noise cancellation instantly was the selling point for me. Very Simple to use with iPhone. Bass is unimpressive, even turned all the way up on equalizer, which is disappointing. Sound quality still good overall, just doesn’t deliver on the bass. I’ve had much cheaper headphones with better bass so I don’t see why Apple couldn’t have delivered on this.', \"Extremely convenient, very good sound, brilliant charging/carrying case.  Big issue: it's *IMPOSSIBLE* for me to get a good fit (they work fine none the less, but sound quality suffers a bit and they fall out too easily).  I have tried all tip sizes and various techniques but only succeeded a few times.  Also caveat: like all IEMs, ear canal will hurt if used for an extended period (~ 1+ hours).  A supplement but not a replacement for over-the-hear headphones.\", \"As titled. The sound quality can't rival over-the-ear headphones by companies like Bose, JBL, and Sony. It's a step up from the AirPods for sure. Noise cancellation is done digitally, which can be less effective than material damping of over the ear headphones. My minimum volume for listening next to a running vacuum is 4. That's four volume up presses from mute on a Samsung note 9.\", 'Original Apple tips did not hold AirPods in place during runs, workouts or sometimes just walking (I tried every tip size). As you can see from the pictures I had to buy foam tips. These new tips were great and gave 2nd life to my AirPods. Sound is great and noise cancelling is good enough. Battery life is just BAD when compared with other options in the market right now. Working from home and jumping on/off video calls require better battery life.', 'So it seems odd to have a charging cable with a type 3 on one side and the Apple connection on the other. Where do I plug it in? I have to buy another charger with the connection to use. I will and talked to an Amazon rep who made it right. But seems easier to just include something useable right out of the box. The headphones are fantastic I was mowing my lawn and turned on for noise cancellation and was able to talk to my friend while mowing the lawn with a gas mower. That part of it is amazing. But I just bought for two 4999 and the price has dropped by 16% it says. Sad for me', \"These AirPod Pros are by far the best earbuds I have ever bought. Just had them a day, not too sure yet about battery life, or long-wear comfort, but the noise cancelling and transparency modes are by far, major game changers, at least for me. Put on noise cancelling and you CAN'T hear the outside world...WOW! Wife was 4ft away screaming at me and I didn't hear her, even with music playing at low volume. But I think the transparency modes might be my favorite thing about these earbuds. I can listen to my music and still be part of the conversation or hear the TV. I love them!\", 'I was surprised by the sound quality and noice cancellation for an item this small. The bass is pretty well balanced and nice highs. The batter life is not that great if you are using ANC but otherwise it will make it through your commute. Very easy to pair with Apple hardware and a little more cumbersome with Android devices and you end up losing a lot of features via the app. The biggest downside for these is that none of the ear tips fit my ears snug enough to stay secure so I had to purchase a wing for a more secure fit.', 'I love using the noise canceling during class when I need to study. I don’t have to listen to my peers talking or shuffling around. The sound quality is on point and I love that they have built in mics for calls/meetings. The battery life is good but I’ve had some cheaper Bluetooth earbuds that have better battery life. Other than that, the quality, the fit, and noise canceling are all worth the price tag. I personally got them on sale for $160. I recommend waiting for a discount before purchasing just for the affordability', \"Just got these for Christmas. I'm SUPER impressed with how well they block background noise! Also they stay in really well while I'm moving around. Sound quality on phone conversation was even better than I anticipated. I could hear and be heard perfectly. My favorite part, besides being wireless, is the touch controls!!! So cool! I can pause or play, adjust volume up or down, skip ahead or go to previous song, and answer, hang up,  or reject calls without touching my phone!! I would have paid twice the price for these little wonders! Highly recommend.\", 'Been  looking and waiting for a Fear Price! Amazon 10 ⭐️. Noise canceling feature can’t be beat! I use them on zoom and finally I can “shut off all the people talking in background.” Audio / Music listening is Crystal Clear. I did have to buy extra earbuds because I have small ears. And it took some time to get use to. Easy to keep clean.  Highly recommend buying them from Amazon because Apple won’t sell them for the price Amazon offers. Great deal/ they are not refurbished/brand new. Yes,  definitely buy  Apple Care Plus.', \"When traveling between the US and Mexico, I lost my air pod pros.  Needing to do a few conference calls while I was on vacation, I opted to grab a cheap pair from a store ($50 type).  The quality was sub part compared to the real thing and the recall tap kept going off whenever I would put the buds back in my ears, so I was constantly having to let people know I didn't mean to call them. As soon as I got home, I ordered a new pair of pros and I couldn't be happier.\", \"I had one airpod replaced due to a defect. the second one had the same defect a few months later and when I tried to get a replacement, I was told it was past the 1-year warranty. So now I have unusable headphones. The defect (noise canceling part failing to cause a constant echo/noise) was acknowledged by Apple and they apparently fixed newer models, but it's unfortunate that they didn't recall the bad ones - they just let them fail.\", 'I’ve tried all three sizes of the ear pieces and no matter what size I use, these fall out of my ears unless I am sitting still. It’s possible I just have weird shaped ear canals but what really takes the rating down for me is the poor connectivity of the AirPods Pro. I like being able to have a wireless connection to calls during work for calls and Zoom meetings. At least half of the time that I use them during a meeting I end up taking them off because it sounds like a call about to lose it’s signal. When I take them out, the call works just fine. Thought it might have just been that one pair so I returned them for another pair. Same thing happens. I have an iPhone 11 too so it’s not like it’s an old iPhone that it’s having trouble pairing with either. I have tried troubleshooting and the best thing I can find is to “forget the Bluetooth device” and then re-pair the AirPods Pro with the iPhone but that’s kind of hard to do in the middle of a call. Again, the fact they don’t stay in my ears truly might be me and the sound quality really is pretty solid. I just think for the price you pay for these, it should be able to maintain a Bluetooth connection during a phone call from 3 feet away.', 'Muy buen producto. Llegó en excelentes condiciones, precintados. Muy buen sonido aunque esperaba otra cosa. Lo que si me gustó, es la tecnología de cancelación de ruido ambiente y transparencia. Aunque no aísla al 100% cumple con su cometido. Lo que si noto una mejora, es en los controles de reproducción/pausa de los mismos, mucho mas efectivo que el “tap” en las versiones anteriores de AirPods. Recomendado para el ecosistema Apple. No recomiendo para auidiófilos.', 'I had other brands previously but these were magical from the first listen! The sound quality and range is amazing! No crackling or fading, just pure rich beautiful sound quality! I got mine during a sale but they would be worth the full retail in my opinion. Charging case is handy, and easy to keep track of them. Grocery shopping is so chaotic I use my AirPods and ignore the rest but what I need to pick up and the music in my ears. Highly suggest these for anyone that enjoys music or hands free calls without speakerphone. Love them!', \"AirPods Pro nail all of the essentials, and the noise cancellation and transparency modes both work really well. Since I’ve been using noise cancelling mainly, I’ve noticed only using these at about 60% volume since you don’t have to compensate for the outside noise. My hearing will probably thank me for that looking forward. These get plenty loud though if you’re really looking to blow your drums out. Coming from AirPods 1, they're a huge step up, and anyone considering the AirPods 2 should take a look at these. For not that much more on an already rather expensive piece of tech, these offer far more value. (Side note: learn how to update them if you get them, it’s very easy. the newest firmware d15 is better than the one that comes with them out of the box)\", 'Can’t comment on battery life since I just got them, but the noise cancellation is seriously magical. These are perfect for the Gym. They stay in your ears much better than regular AirPods and they block out the crappy music playing in the gym perfectly. A little pricey, but they really do deliver. And they sound great! Update: No idea why, but after only a couple of days they won’t pass the seal test and I’ve found them really finicky while working out. Buyer beware. Maybe next time they’ll include Compyl-style foam tips.', \"These air pod pros are a significant upgrade from the original air pods I owned.  Both in sound quality and the ability to stay in my ear.  It has a neat feature where it measures the quality of the seal in your ear when connected to your phone so you don't have to guess if it is fitting as it should.  My only gripe (and this is so 1st world problems!) but these things aren't very easy to extract out of their case.  If I get a phone call, a good 10-15 second wrestling match to get the buds out of their snug cave ensues.  You can't turn it upside down as they won't fall out.  So, I wish Apple would have made 'some' type of raised edge on the sides of these things so fingers could easily extract from their dwelling.  Otherwise, It's a bit difficult for my fat fingers to get them out fast.  Otherwise, this would be a 5-star rating no doubt.\", 'Used for about a week and then found the left bud battery drained overnight. Sent for replacement for about two weeks. Right now I still did not get it back. Do me a favor stay away from this product, the quality is sooooooo bad!', 'My husband bought these for me as a gift. He has the same ones when I wasn’t even sure if I wanted these. I wanted something waterproof to listen in the shower without it being too loud for everyone else in the house and possibly wake up my grandson. Well, there was a incident and it was left in a pair of pants, that was washed in the washing machine and they were completely dry it their case. Best of all, it still works like nothing happened! I highly recommend these.', \"It's good.  Why are you reading another review about this?  You know it's the best, just get them!  I am an audiophile and sound engineer from years back.  I still have hearing acuity in the 20hz to 21khz range and I am kind of 'older'.  I am so picky, you have no idea.  I can easily hear the difference between a standard CD 44khz samples and a 192khz version of the same recording in 16 bit or 24 bit.  And with these, I can hear the difference in my HD content easily.  The airpods did not have this sound when I tried them.  But these airpod pro definitely live up to the hype.  Are they as good as my wired headsets?  No.  But very respectable for in-ear 'cans'.  Also, voice calls and the way it syncs up with my iphone Xs Plus has been flawless.  I tried others and I just have just listened to the hype and saved the money spent on the other, lesser, bluetooth earbuds. (Creative buds sounded pretty good but fell apart and would not always sync!)  I am very happy with these!\", 'UPDATE: I bought these a while ago and at first I hated them. Now I love them the did fall Off at the beginning but once you adjust the earbud size it’s fine. I had to break it in before it got easier to work with. I update my 1 start to 4. These fall off on me while I’m working. At first I wore them as I was just around the house and they wouldn’t fall. But once I went back to work they starting falling off like crazy. At work I do floor sets with retail. I’m constantly bending climbing on laters, using step stools to set a wall. Not ideal for a constantly moving type of person', \"It's very comfortable first of all, and the sound quality is like 2x better than the AirPods. There is no questioning that. And it's straight for, ward and its already pre set up for you and the connection from the start when you first paid it; it's straightforward it catches on real quick, and you don't need to press down a button like the first and the second generation did. The only bad part about the new airport pro is that since the noise cancelation is already pre set up for you, so there is no way for you to change the set up to something like the next song or pause or skip like the 1st and the 2nd generation had. The only this it has is and already pre set up is that if you press either AirPods, it will pause the song, and if you hold the AirPods, it will turn off/ turn on the noise cancellation. But other than that it's excellent!\", \"My old AirPods died so I tried these.  The fit is much better and I like the noise cancellation.  I don't like the way you have to grip them to use the features like pause, forward or reverse.  You have to touch them is a sweet spot on the front with an unnatural motion.  I feel like Apple could have figured out a way to let you tap somewhere to use those features but overall a great product.\", 'Unfortunately I had to return because the right AirPod kept falling out of my ear. I tried changing out the adjustable tips and tried changing the way I placed them in my ear but no matter what I did it kept falling out. I listen to music at work while at my desk so I wasn’t doing anything other than typing and it would gradually get looser and looser then fall out, I can’t imagine if I was exercising or doing anything other than sitting down! This only happened with my right ear, my left was just fine. The sound was great and the noice cancellation was top notch so I’m bummed I had this problem.', 'I finally purchased my first Apple pods Pro and was disappointed. 1. The sound quality is passable but my Bose Bluetooth are much better. 2. Battery like is way shorter than advertised. 3. the noise canceling feature and listening feature is fantastic. 4. Fit is horrible for me and neither of the three sizing adaptors allow the pods to stay in place.   So at this point I use them as a fill gap for my Bose when recharging. Better use of my money would have just been buying a back up Bose earphones. Bose fit way better for any movement.', \"Even if your old headphones work, it's time to upgrade -these are so much better in fit, sound, and noise reduction.  Love these!  Plus, you can customize the case to easily identify yours over others in the family. ______ After a month of use there was a problem with one headphone - Apple easily replaced it and all is good now.  Excellent customer service and they stand behind their product.\", 'I received my Airpods pro a week ago and am already preparing to return them to Amazon and heres why. The Airpods pro have exceptional sound quality, battery life, ANC, and other features but they come at a cost $235 which is quite a bit for earbuds with the flaws that I and others have discovered. The Airpods pro have a few issues ranging from misaligned seams (check attached photo) to being able to break the software under normal use. In the photo you can clearly see that the seams on my left Airpod is not aligned so much to the point that I can get my fingernail easily stuck on the ridge it creates. The next issue that I discovered with the Airpods pro is when you have ANC or Transparency mode enabled the earbuds will occasionally make a popping sound like that of a blown speaker except for that fact that the speakers in the Airpods are fine and it is simply a software issue. The next issue I discovered was when I was listening to Youtube on my phone for music and went to check the battery life because I had been using them for quite some time and it read 50% left so i thought great 3 hours later i check again and the battery life is still reading at 50% which i saw as strange so I put the Airpods in their charging case and they charged up to 51% immediately so after another 30 mins of use I put them away for a full 3 minutes and after checking the power it had dropped to 10% which following the amount of time I had been using them for seemed appropriate. The final issue that I have found with the Airpods pro seems to be the worst of them all and once again it is while using the Youtube app. Occasionally to constantly (10+ times) I had my Airpods pro get stuck in either off mode for ANC or in ANC mode simply by pausing my Youtube video swiping down on my IPhone and switching from one mode to the other and once I did that it would show the animation on my phone but not play the tone through the Airpods but it would turn ANC off and when I attempted to switch the mode again or to Transparency mode it would do the animation and not play the tone and now it would not change the mode on the Airpods but it would show that it did on my phone. I found 2 solutions to this the first being that you put the Airpods back into their charging case for a few minutes and that would occasionally fix them or I would have to completely repair them to my phone which after getting it to happen 10 times in a row without fail got annoying quickly. All in all the Airpods pro are good earbuds but have major flaws and are not worth the price that Apple is charging for them', 'LOVE THESE! I upgraded to these after my periods AirPods got broken by my toddler and I am so so happy I decided to make the switch! Not only does the battery last me forever, the noise cancellation is AMAZING! I wear them with noise cancellation on even when I’m not listening to anything just because it is that good. They are super comfy in my ears as well! Not to mention, they don’t fall out nearly as easily as the standard AirPods tend to do!', 'Freedom from the earbud cord is enough to recommend Apple’s AirPods.  For me, the AirPods Pro has definite upgrades from the original AirPods.  I found the AirPod controls easier to navigate music tracks and switch the noise cancellation on & off from the AirPods.  Sound quality is excellent. While Apple provides three different AirPod cushions to accommodate ear size I’ve found none provided a firm fit and will start to slide out during my workout.  This was not an issue with Apple’s original AirPods that fit so well I would forget I had them in my ears.  Thought I heard news the Find My app would be enhanced to be able identify the current location of the Apple AirPods case, not just the last location where the pod case was opened.  If true that would be a welcome enhancement. Overall if music is essential for finding motivation to get to the gym….like it is for me…I recommend the Apple AirPods Pro.', \"Pros: - Very comfortable. Other in-ear headphones have been uncomfortable for me. - They feel more secure compared to other Apple earpods - For other in-ear headphones, if you talk while you have them in, it sounds really weird, but with these it's more natural sounding. Cons - Noise cancelling is decent, not amazing. Older Bose products are better, I haven't tried Bose wireless though. - Audio quality is decent, not amazing. - They don't connect as quickly and consistently to your device as it should. Sometimes when I put them in my ear, I have to open bluetooth on my phone and force it to connect. Usually it works seamlessly but not always.\", \"I just love these...however, the stem is so fragile that one cracked within the first 3 months, the other within the year. You use the stem for turning it on and off. It does still work with the cracked plastic but I'm not sure for how long.\", 'Sound is great but the fit of the earplugs sucks .  I simply cannot get the left ear to pass the fit test. I have small ear innards  I think apple needs to improve the fit. One size does not fit all. I am a short petite woman with small ears   I have purchased from Amazon a set of earplugs that are supposed to be very comfy. Will report back', 'Awesome as expected. Noise cancellation isn’t like wearing a set of over ear headphones where it drowns out everything but cancels most sounds like lawn mowers. When I take them off all the white noise comes rushing back and then realize how crazy it is all the sounds happening even in a quiet room. Transparency mode is like having super hearing. Controls are simple and other features like auto pause when you take one headphone out is convenient. Audio quality is great. Maybe not if you’re an audiophile but I’m not and to me it’s amazingly balanced between highs mids and bass. Worth every penny. Especially since it’s cheaper from amazing than Apple. Don’t forget to run an update on them. Not hard just not straightforward. Google it.', \"I ordered my first Airpod Pro and when arrived, it would not sync with my I Phone nor I Pad. Worked with people at Apple and could not fix problem so returned for a  2nd pair. They arrived and this time paired with IPhone and IPad. Very challenging to pair with Alexa but finally got it to work. After listening for 20 minutes, the Airpods quit totally. Charged them to 100% and even after charging, would start listening and they would quit playing.  Very frustrating so I returned both pair for a refund. This is what you get when you buy an AirPod Pro for $194.00.  Probably 2nd's or returns so they tried to send them to another sucker! Done with Airpods Pro!\", \"Sound quality was fine, but they would NOT stay in my ear. I tried a few solutions but ultimately one fell out into a public toilet and it became dead to me. Do NOT spend money on this, it is far better to buy the older version just so it won't go to waste. Completely disappointed in Apple over this product, I NEVER felt comfortable with them in my ear because I thought they'd fall out, even AFTER I tried putting on some attachment that helped keep them in (but which was a pain to take on and off of the airpods).\", 'So I have one headset for calls, one headset for airplanes, one headset for music. Now I use these for all. They do noise canceling almost as good as my over the ear ones, music sounds great, and my zoom and telephone calls sound good also. Plus I can recharge them a few times with the carry case. I usually recharge once throughout the day, as I am a heavy user. This has really simplified my life not having to use multiple headsets for different purposes, this does them all well, and so easy to use with an iphone.', 'Bought these for my wife, and she gave them to me, because they were falling out of her ears, and she tried all of the sizes/combinations of ear tips. The noise cancellation is almost non existent, my Bose do a MUCH  better job. With the Bose, I can cut the grass and not hear the mower. The “transparent “ mode just amplifies the background noise, which is super distracting.', 'I was surprised by many things with these headphones.  First, I was worried that they would fall out and be easy to lose.  They stay in very well when exercising or moving around in any way.  I love the on-ear controls. Simply put it out, and the sound pauses so you can talk to someone quickly.  The noise-canceling could be better, but it is good.  Honestly, when in the city probably better for safety that it is not perfect.  Also, great noise-canceling for the size.  Other better headphones are larger over the ear.  Great purchase.', 'Purchased product as upgrade from Airpods.  Wife has Airpod pros and they work well.  Got my set and went to charge them via my laptops USB in my office.  Oh, but wait I cannot do that with the cable provided.  Apple decided to pack a lightning to mini USB cable.  Ironic they call it a  mini USB.  USB stands for \"universal serial bus\"...now that we have two sizes the \"universal\" is not accurate!  With that Apple did not pack an adapter(USB to Mini USB), so the cable provided is useless unless I spend more money.  For $200 they should provide what is needed for the masses.  I am not ware of many systems that have mini USB standard.  How many wall adapter have mini USB ports.  Have not seen any at the hotels I stay at either.  Apple get real.', 'They work well I like them so far it’s been about a couple weeks. I charge the case with my phone charger since I spent almost all my money on these and couldn’t get the block… You should also consider buying the tiny in-ear hooks if you’re active or your ears get slippery. They have cheap ones on eBay free shipping and various colors. It took me a few days to get used to the transparency mode I kept thinking they were falling out cause I could hear everything crystal clear lol. But I love it cause the volume is the exact same it doesn’t sound any quieter or louder than when they’re on noise canceling. I like the convenience of the charging case and I can’t wait to buy a bunch of adorable and unnecessary covers to put on it. If you have the money and are thinking about getting them just go for it … Don’t buy them for the hype or the price tag or the brand but buy them because they’re convenient and fun. If you’re a music lover and picky about headphones you’ll love these.', 'Purchase these to replace my bulky Beats wired set that I’ve had for a few years now. Figured it was time for a new set of headphones. I was caught between this and the MPow X3 (huge price difference as Airpods are $200 (sale) and MPOW X3 are $60. I’m not a big sound guy but I wanted something that I could use while on the plane so noise cancellation was a big part of which I would buy. After watching a ton of reviews on both via YouTube, I ultimately I went with the AirPods Pro. Everything so far as met my expectations. Sound quality is great and noise cancellation was pretty sweet. Overall happy with my purchase. I do wish that you were able to control the volume on the airpods itself rather then getting on your phone to control it. I assume the next generation of airpod pros with allow that.', 'Love the fit.  They fit perfectly in your ear.  The old AirPods I had to do things to keep them in my ears.  These stay in my ears and are very comfortable. The sound quality is superb; much better than my old AirPods.  I can hear the nuances from the music much better. I like the fact that you can access Siri without tapping.  I can either listen to someone talking to me or block out ambient noises. I also love the fact that they can charge without a cord.  Love the upgrade.', 'I bought these for myself to block out noises at work and to be able to concentrate. I found that once my ears got used to having them in and no longer hurt,I loved my air pods pro. Sadly the right one quit working after only six months of use. They are in the shop under warranty but it’s been several days and no one has even looked at them yet. They warned me that I’ll be without my air pods for 2-4 weeks which seems like a really long time! I’m disappointed in their lifespan and the repair process through Apple.', 'The sound quality is good. They stay in my ears well. My ears are pretty sensitive to all ear buds. These ones hurt me less than most but more than my old school E2Cs. The integration with Apple products is really nice. They read my text messages to me ( most the time). I am able to control the AirPods from my Apple Watch. The charge lasts as expected. The AirPods will last one day of heavy use. The case charge will last for days.', \"At this price point, these earbuds needed to be perfect in order to get 5 stars from me.  Unfortunately, they were not perfect.  The noise cancellation feature did not meet my expectation.  I've had several Bose noise-canceling products before, so those were the baseline against which I judged these Airpods Pro.  And I can tell you that while the sound quality is actually perfect, these Apple Airpods Pro left quite a bit to be desired when it comes to noise cancellation.  Too much white noise when this feature is turned on. The battery life also needs to be a bit better if you are going to price your product like this.\", \"I absolutely love these,  the noise cancelation is instantaneous and with just a firm press you can turn it right back off, I used to have jabra elite 65t's and if you want a cheaper earbud with similar characteristics in noise cancelation and firm fit, and good battery life you can probably get for like fifty or sixty bucks, but I have had the pros for a couple months now and they are just amazing!!! After a few months I have noticed one thing though which is when I'm on whatsapp specifically, the audio is very choppy even with excellent internet.\", 'Apple AirPod Pro are great if desire external air pods that work seamlessly with your Apple devices, e.g., iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, etc.  These air pods fit better than regular air pods & work much better than non-Apple air pods.  Also this device is necessary if u use this device in conjunction with NOOPL, an external plug-in App for iPhone, that enhances audio using the AirPods as a directional microphone.', 'I love how these fit into my ear and I love how they sound!  Could the battery life be better, I think so, but I can get 3 hrs +/- of contiuous use out of these.  I only charge the case about once per week.  You get three different size silicone ear pieces to fit over the buds so you can get the right fit for your ears.  And the fact that they have actually built a sound test in to help you determine if you have the correct size on the air buds, is just fantastic!!  Definitely would buy again, and in fact, I liked them so much  I bought a pair for my wife to have as well!!', 'Though sound stage and sonic performance doesn\\'t come close to my Around Ear Sennheiser PXC-550 (for airline use) & BTNC 4.50 (rougher gym use). The Active Noise Cancellation of the open back Air Pod Pro compares quite well to these two BT Sennheisers\\' I own.  Granted, I would not use nor recommend this on a flight vs my PXC-550 (as one needs a full-on, Around Ear headphones, with passive noise isolation design of the ear cups and pads, to supplement the electronic ANC). Around Ear Headphones with ANC WINS EVERY TIME for flight use. No contest!) But as a \"daily driver\" and around town set of ANC ear buds, plus Apple\\'s seamless operation with my Product Red iPhone 8 Plus, it suites me quite well.', 'I had a couple of issues with these… Firstly for some reason they never really fit my ears right. They would’ve fall out or be uncomfortable. I never really had that problem with a pair of in ear headphones before.  The sound quality was great and I think that they would be worth having if they had just fit my ears. But between that and the short battery life, I did end up returning the product. But if they had fit my ears fine I would’ve kept them. I was kind of bummed to have to send them back.', \"Have had these for about 3 months now.  I find them to be lite and  fit nice and comfortably in my ears.  If I didn't listen to my music I wouldn't know they're in.  Very comfortable.  Easy to use and can select which pod you want to be the lead or both can operate the same way for changing tracks, pause or answering calls.  Or if you don't want to touch your pods once they're in your ears you can just ask SIRI to do the action you'd like.  Love that feature use it all the time in the gym.  I have an Apple Iphone X and it works seamlessly with it.  I recommend buying these.\", 'I like that it is compact but the top keeps flipping open. They do not stay in my ear and fall out when talking. I had problems trying to find the right size for my ears and none of them fit right. The sound quality is okay and does block out noise. After having them in for awhile they become very uncomfortable. I can’t say if I recommend or not since they have some things about them are good and others not so good.', 'Received yesterday. Didn’t open until this morning. Sweet mother of god, why weren’t these cleaned first??!!?!? Also were not reset. I know they are renewed or whatever but I thought they at least go thru a quality assurance process. They still had someone else’s name attached to them. I hate I got these horrible pictures but I was rushing. I disinfected them & cleaned them but I shouldn’t have had to do that myself. Other than that, these came across Amazon Prime Day Deals & I got for a decent price. Almost wish I bought them new instead just for the sake of my mental. They work fine. No issues there but 3 stars because I received them like this.', \"I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed that these don't stay put enough for me to go for a run with them.  Even after doing the fit test (a pretty cool feature), they come loose and have even fallen out a couple of times when I was walking around.  Despite that drawback, they sound really good.  I am not an overly critical audiophile, but I can sure tell how effective the ANC works.  You can hear some background noise, but I didn't realize how much noise was filtered out until I turned off noise canceling.  In comparison, it was MUCH louder without the ANC enabled; I was very impressed how much peripheral noise is filtered!  Not cheap, I can't get them to pair with my brand new Garmin Forerunner 245 Music, but they work seamlessly with other Apple products.\", 'I love the AirPods Pro. Battery life is good, noise canceling is good, and sound quality is great. The only complaint I have is that they are no where near as comfortable as the original AirPods. I can only wear them for a short while (30 minutes), then they start hurting my ears. It is the larger plastic case that is the problem and not the soft adapters.', \"What can I say? They're airpods. They look great, but in terms of overall quality I'm not super impressed. Definitely not the worst, but also not the best of its class. Price is pretty high but is worth it when you consider the status and prestige surrounding this audio equipment and brand.. lol only complaint is that ANC can cause headaches or bother your ears after a while, and the individual airpods can slip out of your ear during exercise. Other than that, good quality, good sound, and good looks!\", \"My wife is an Apple addict.  I am a Windows 10 user and was skeptical about using this on my Desktop PC.  The setup was instantaneous and after a bit of time, I went downstairs into our garage and was still getting the PC sounds!  Since I'm 79 I always worry about new tech.  My iPad pro instantly picked up the earpods which I now can see the battery life on the pods & the case.  I also was able to charge these with my ipad pro lightning cable.\", 'In all actually, the sound quality and battery life are quite good. The noise cancellation isn’t great. The main reason for the 1 star review across the board is that these are the most expensive pieces of garbage I have ever purchased. They do not stay in whatsoever. I’ve bought extra padded inserts, they still fall out within a few minutes. I have tried every trick suggested to keep them in, but they never stay. When trying to use them for my guided meditations, my head is perfectly still and they finally stay put, but infuriatingly enough, they don’t play even though they are connected and my device shows that headphones are connected. I realize that not everyone has this problem, but if you do, Apple and AppleCare won’t do anything to help you. There are so many good options out there for a lot cheaper, so you’re better off steering clear of these.', 'Things I love: the noise cancellation and transparency settings. The noise cancellation makes listening to music while mowing the lawn (on a ride on mower) possible and the transparency setting allows for me to run and still be able to hear traffic and other noises. Things I disliked: the silicone ear tips would not stay in my ears. Fell out while jogging several times and I nearly returned these. Was able to find memory foam tips for sale from other retailers on Amazon that saved these headphones for me. I use these all the time now!', \"I've been the owner of these Airpods Pro for a few months now. When I first bought them, I was wondering (as most people probably are) is it worth the price? The answer is yes and no. They have good sound quality, and the noise cancelling works well. I haven't had any problems with the sound quality so far. As a young teen girl I use the middle-size fitting, and I don't have an issue with them falling out. Some problems I've had with these Airpods  however is that they can disconnect randomly. This never happens when I use my Chromebook, but sometimes if I close an app while on my phone they can disconnect. I have a Motorola 7, which is an android, but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the issue. Whatever the reason is, it can get frustrating when I have to turn my Bluetooth on and off again to get reconnected. Also, the battery life on the Airpod Pros is not very good. It only lasts a few hours before needing to be charged again. This is frustrating if you're like me and use your Airpods for school. Overall, I think these are handy and easy to use. But the price is a bit extreme. Though I enjoy using them and use them almost everyday, I think a more reasonable price for them is $150. However, I have no regrets buying these and will continue to use them.\", 'Sound quality, these headphones are really nice. They are clear and pretty crisp. They are not too bass heavy, which I really don’t listen to too much bass heavy music anyway. The headphones connect SEAMLESSLY. Charge SEAMLESSLY.  The noise cancellation is honestly not as great as apple tries to portray it to be. Like if you are in a constant sound environment, sure things go silent(mostly ac), but when I’m at the gym I still hear a bunch of outside noise. (Nothing horrible). Then surprisingly I find my self using the passive hearing quite often. Also when I first got them it felt pretty weird because I was so used to wearing the regular skull candy earbuds with that plastic tip going into my ear with the silicone cover. Then with these it’s different, it feels weird at first, but you get used to it and not sure if it’s just habit or what but I want to continuously like push in the the ear bud, but no need they stay in.... I have had only like two times maybe where things disconnected from sound. I just put them in the case and bada bing things were back to normal. Also I sweat a lot at the gym and these are pretty great with it. When I say a lot I mean like I look like I jumped into a pool after the gym, but they don’t get affected from it. Also I had bought these after buying Powerbeats pro, which sucked so bad, (May have just been my experience) but yeah I returned those for these... also let me add a great charging system stupid fast. I don’t have a wireless charging pad so I haven’t used that functionality yet, but I’m sure it works great.', \"I wouldn't have been tempted by the AirPods [my teen requested those and loves them] but the 'bud' piece on the AirPod Pros intrigued me - I hate having to adjust mid-run...tried on the treadmill without a sweat wicking headband and they kept slipping [with the medium bud/whatever - will try again with the large]...switched to the large and used them in a race - they were GREAT...for ten miles.  No wind, could barely hear people [and cars which may not be the safest] around me...the sound quality is great...well done Apple! Con - I feel they should come with the plug and cable vice just the cable...\", 'Sound quality and noise canceling are great - when the air pods are firmly seated - which is only for the first few minutes of wear. Unfortunately, they do not stay in my ears, even during the slightest movement or exercise. Tried all the adapters with little success. Looking at third-party foam adapter, but not very confident they will help. I expected better from Apple.', 'I bought these in the summer and by the fall I was getting feedback in both sides. I brought them to apple to get fixed and was told the serial number was from over a year ago and they were out of warranty. So I have old, non working AirPods now.', 'Choosing Apple is like making all choices during the pandemic...it’s the best bad option. The sound quality and noise cancellation seem like they will be great once.... I buy something else so they actually stay in my ears and I buy something else to actually charge them Tech is only innovative when it isn’t also adding to the destruction of the planet...how many old iPhone headphones do I have that Apple made obsolete? How many old usb outlet chargers do I have that Apple made obsolete? How long will it be before this obnoxious mini usb/wireless getup is also destined for the landfill? I’m losing my patience with Apple.', 'Got it for my boyfriend. I mean, he ain’t my boyfriend yet but he about to be 👀 ANYWAYS, we both tried them on and love it. It’s comfortable and wish my AirPods was this newer version. I was afraid these would hurt my ears but I read the reviews before I bought and they’re pretty nice. I love that it comes with three different ear piece sizes though. Noise cancellation is good. Doesn’t cancel out everything but when you have music playing, yes. It does. As if my man doesn’t already not listen well. Hahaha jk. But nah for real. Definitely recommend. It is a high price but if you just want to splurge or spoil yourself or your significant other then get these.', \"As others have stated, they sound pretty good. The integration with your iPhone is pretty awesome too. Those pluses do not make up for their cons... First, the fit is terrible. I have never been able to use any headphones from apple -- neither wired nor the pods. They just don't stay in my ears. These latest pods are no different. The silicone tips are too short to catch on my earholes for a good fit. Because of the fit, they don't seal well and so ANC works at well at all. That said ANC isn't that great even if I could get a good fit (if I push them into my ears and hold them there, I do get a good fit). I've got Sennheiser PCX-550-II phones with ANC and the noise reduction is far superior. I also have B&O E8s and their passive noise reduction is superior too. The ANC provided by these buds is better than nothing. If you want good ANC, go with another brand. All in all, for $250, I would expect a better fit and function.\", \"No, I'm not talking about my babies. I'm talking about my airpods. I have a newborn baby who is a NOISY sleeper. I'm talking grunts, coos, snores, you name it. Sticking one airpod in my ear and playing a podcast is literally the only way I can sleep with her in the bassinet next to the bed, but still be able to hear her when she's actually crying to eat. They are super comfortable because of the squishy ear piece and the noise cancellation when both are in is amazing. If you're in a position to splurge on something for yourself, there is no better way to spend your money.\", 'I’ve had the first generation AirPods for almost 3 years. I’ve always had trouble with them staying in my ear — especially the left bud. Over the last year, the sound has decreased in the right bud & the battery life has declined as well. But THESE??? These little babies are sooooooo good! The sound quality (to me) is comparable to my solo beats. Now I may or may not be exaggerating lolll but they sound amazing, honestly! I can wear both comfortably for hours & so far the battery life has been close to 5 hours with 2 hours of being on the phone. & I love the fact that my messages get read while they are in my ear! 10/10 recommend! If you’re reading this & they are still $199...GRAB THEM NEOWWW! ;)', 'I was very excited to actually get these. Once I received them, they fell out of my ears 5 times in 2 days; once in my car and fell under my gas pedal and one time as I was getting out of my car and went under the car and a few times in my house as I was trying to get used to them. Also, the left earbud actually quit working after two days.  I had just taken it off the charger and it was fully charged.  I was required to put it back in the charger for it to start working again.  Again, it quit working. I would not recommend buying these ever.', 'Easily one of the best purchases I have ever made. My new favorite thing to do is go from transparency mode to noise cancellation. It’s so soothing for some reason, like you have literally just blocked the rest of the world out by holding a button. The only downside is that I know I cannot do that without the AirPods in and I really wish I could 🤣. If you have gotten this far, and can afford these, go ahead and get them and thank me later. PS also get a protective case for over the charging case.', 'I\\'m rating these on a limited basis as someone who doesn\\'t use them a lot. The sound is great. I don\\'t use them a lot, but intermittently so I can\\'t really say how they stand up in loud environments or how long the batteries last, but for someone who uses them occasionally and in \"ordinary\" environments for an hour or so at a time, I am very satisfied with these. I especially like how easy it is to drop them in the recharge pod.', 'These are great and worth the price. The sound cancellation is great but the feature to amplify surrounding sounds is even more useful. Just tap them to turn from cancellation to amplification to speak to someone or hear around you. Great sound except for base (which is normal for any ear buds). Unfortunately for me personally I couldn’t get a good fit and they would slip out unlike the cheaper AirPods which never fall out. So I prefer the regular AirPods even though they don’t have the useful features of these because they stay put and don’t slip out.', 'Pros - Fairly good sound - Noise cancelling surprisingly good - Lightweight, compact form factor - Pressure relieving valve eliminates the claustrophobic feeling typical in ear canal buds cause Cons - Not good for using while laying in bed on your side (the back side of the driver presses against ear).  Stand AirPods fit better for this. - Stethoscope effect ruins the experience: in ear canal design means you can hear your pulse, jaw, swallowing, and breathing when listening at lower volumes.  Not good for movies or classical music because of this.  Also lower frequencies from the outside environment are still heard with noise cancelling on and they actually stand out an seem louder since higher frequencies are suppressed more. - Slightly muddy sound that requires setting the sound accessibility in iOS to flat moderate level to balance them out - No battery replacement service: expect them to run 1-2 hours max in about 2 years and not have an option to replace the battery.', \"I'm a medical student who spends lots of time listening to lectures, or listening to music while reading. I have used the Bose QuietComfort for years and really do love them and they are better than these because they are over the ear. The down side that they are bulky, very obviously off putting (everyone knows you when you wear them) and not practical for casual every day use. I have tried the regular Airpods and I took them back after a few days because I felt like I had music in my ears but not a single thing was blocked out by them (even though they're in ear) and they HURT. These have a great and customizable fit that is comfortable for the entire time of wear. I will wear them down to 0% everyday. The noise cancelling is really good for in ear buds, though the Bose is slightly better but that is expected. The sound quality is maintained through loud volume and has a good range of frequency. The transparency mode feature is SO nice when studying with other people as I can quickly switch over instead of taking them out. I still use and love my Bose and switch back and forth between the two, but if I'm studying on an errand, these are so much more convenient.\", \"So I have been using this product for about 1 month now and I do think this item is a great product : Noise Cancellation : The main reason I bought these headphones was for the noise cancellation , and I am not disappointed. This is not your 100% top tier noise cancellation but it gets the job done for almost all situations. It does best getting rid of constant background noise such as an air conditioners , fans , rain , small chit chat. It does not sadly work to well when the noise is  sharp or too loud . This includes people yelling , screaming , loud creeks and cracks . Other than that I will reiterate these do get the job done in most situations , and as a bonus the ability to go from listening to all these sounds around you to a near complete silence is fun to do and just mess around with. Active Movement : I will say it could be much worse , they stay on strong during , decent on jog's but not so well on sprints and full speed runs (this is all considering you have the right size tips) . During most weight training sessions and body workouts sessions they stay on fairly well but sometimes will need readjusting . I will say there are much better headphones for working out . Battery Life : Honestly battery life has not been a problem for me , I work retail and I whenever I have an opportunity I put one of the earbuds in the ear and if that one gets low I just to the other ear. With this method I really don't ever have a problem . Even having both air pods in at the same time they really do last a good amount of time and I  am happy with their battery life. Noise Quality : I will say the noise quality is a solid 4/5 , you can hear noises clearly, smooth bass that you hear can clearly hear (can't feel it sadly , but that is expected since these are earbuds) , I have asked multiple people about the microphone and 6/7 said I sounded much better when I had them on vs when I had them off (the 7th person said they did not hear a difference). Opinion : All in all I give these headphones a strong 4/5 , the price does hurt the pockets but an Apple product will almost always do that to you . My whole opinion comes from someone who did not have Airpods 2 so I am not 100% sure on if these are that much better than the generations before it . I will say the Air Pod Pro's are a nice investment and if you do have some left over cash they do their job great and being able to cycle between the three modes these headphones have is not only very useful but also entertaining. Extra : So I will say be careful when trying to change the rubber tips, I ripped my first pair of medium rubber tips because I was pulling them incorrectly, I recommend you unwind the tip and grab as close as you can to the base and then pull . This well help you NOT rip them . I will also add, while I was changing my rubber tips a little piece of white paper got stuck inside the base of one of the tips , this made the sound coming from that earbud really quite and I got scared I had broken one. After I found out the problem I got some tweezers and pulled out the little piece of paper.\", \"These air pods pro work great.  The noise cancelling is convenient and yet inconvenient at times.  Shutting out noise makes my listening better, but it's a bummer when someone wants to talk to me!  They are adjustable, though -- if one remembers to make that switch!\", 'This is one of the best products apple had created. I was confused on buying between the AirPods 2 and the AirPods Pro. I just went by my instinct since it had rubber tips on them and also had a pro tag to it that matches with my phone and voila, I didn’t go wrong. The sound quality is amazing and the built quality is top notch. The options within the AirPods are awesome with the transparency mode and spatial audio that blows your mind. Also, kudos to Amazon for a super fast delivery as usual and also since I faced a small packaging issue I had to replace my pair of AirPods which was also done in a jiffy as promised by the team of experts. I also love the fact that they prioritise a lot of benefits for the prime users which makes you feels a little special. Overall it’s a 5 star product which you can never go wrong with full value for every dollar.', 'I own several Apple products which I enjoy, a lot. These AirPod Pros have been the only and worst Apple product I’ve ever own. I literally pulled of my AirPod bud tip and the actual tip came off. When I contacted Amazon support, I was instructed to contact the manufacturer. I contact Apple (the manufacturer) and they stated I had a limited warranty, but, since it’s physical damage, I’d have to pay full pop for a new right AirPod for the cost of $97 dollars.. and I haven’t even had it for a year. Worst investment of headphones I’ve ever purchased and will not be purchasing Apple Earphones or Headphones ever again. I will however continue purchasing their other devices because those have been reliable. But as for headphones, never again. As for the quality experience, they were enjoyable, Bluetooth did not always connect well with all my new Apple devices, and, sometimes they would make a shrinking noise. But they definitely rocked. But the framing is cheap and not reliable and Apple charges you for their failures. Is this a decline in Apples commitment to delivering a great product for headphones. I legitimately now wish I would have gotten the Sony’s or something else for the $300 dollar price range that ranked high in quality and experience. I’ve been an advocate for Apple products since probably 2007. They lost a really good customer that shares there great experience. And, I’m well aware that they could care less about my small voice..', \"For noise cancellation to work you MUST have both buds in your ears. I don't like this feature when in the car. If both buds are in and you are driving, as the air pressure changes in the car, especially on windy days, there is a noticeable flutter and pressure fluctuation in the center ear. This is uncomfortable. For music quality they are good but again, cannot really be used in the car because of the pressure fluctuations.\", 'Like the simplicity of the AirPods. But I think Apple has either lots it’s touch on design or became too cocky to recognize that this design takes sometime to get used to. Switching from gen1, miss my tap, and the stems are too short to interact with, and case is too cumbersome to take out of the pods from the case especially, if you have fat fingers.Ear  Fit is mediocre at best and still could not get over with the fear that they might fall out of my ear and I will loose them in the cracks, while on the sidewalks. Now the bad things out of my chest, these are the best functioning airpods with great integration into Apple devices. It switches great between my Apple TV and iPhone and MBP. Flawless in functionality mediocre in design and little uncomfortable in usage. Overall if you can live with the flaws for about a week, you will love them.', 'Upon receiving these, I experienced poor sound quality and minimal noise cancellation which indicates a poor seal. I never could pass the Ear Tip Fit Test with any of the 3 sizes included with the AirPods Pro. After changing tips for maybe the fifth time, the right mount (black plastic piece) came out of the bud, making it useless.  Due to difficulty getting a decent fit and apparent flimsy build quality, I am returning these defective ear buds.', 'the airpod pro does not block out noise.  I used them for cycling and there was always a lot of outside noise. Since the right Pod stopped working a few weeks ago I went back to using my Echo buds and am much happier since they actually noise cancellation that works and the sound quality is far superior than the airpod pro.', 'I bought these on advice of my Son who is quite technical.  He said his friends at work (sales) use them all day.  My wife hinted for a \"cheap\" pair for her birthday.  I\\'m the only child in the family and bought her these.  I got the usual \"you didnt need to but top of the line \" stuff from her.  After a couple of days at her office, she started telling me how great they worked.  Noise cancelled the chatter.  She said the range was good enough she left her office for the bathroom next door and they worked the entire time.  Pay a little more and your wife will love them.', \"This review is just for the small number of people who keep using their Apple products until they wear out, and have not desire to upgrade for the sake of upgrading.  Unless you have upgraded in the past few years, you won't have any plug for recharging the batteries for the airpods.  So for a couple of hundred dollars, Apple expects you to use a plug you got for a newer ipad or iphone - or for you to buy a plug just for this product . Always looking for a way to make another buck, Apple.\", \"Some of the features offered by these airpods are pretty good but these silicone tips are VERY uncomfortable. I cannot get a good fit. They slide out very easily. I can't even turn my head to hard because they'll slip out of my ear. I had the 2nd Generation Pods for almost 2 years & was hoping to upgrade but these are not it. The last ones were so comfortable that I'd forget I had them on & actually would even fall asleep with them in. I'm sad that I didn't return them in time for a refund but was hoping I could get used to them but I can't.\", 'Maybe the problem is with expectations. When you pay a premium price for a product such as Apple the expectation is fairly high. However, the AirPods continually fall out of my ears regardless of adjustments. The battery life is surprisingly short although this again might be more of an issue with expectations than actual battery life. The Bluetooth connectability is very good between apple products. The noise-cancelling is reasonable. All in all the price is high for what the product provides in my opinion', 'The ear tips that came with them did not provide a tight seal at any size.  Had to buy the Comfy foam tips to get the seal.  Otherwise, the sound is great and now they stay in.  I use them mostly for making phone calls because I unexpectedly bought the Airpods Maxes when they were on sale.  Those I use for music now.  Portability is also a plus as the Maxes will never leave the house.', 'ive always been an over the ear kind of headphone person-- the in-ear type usually dont sound that good and fall out of my ears-- these are such an improvement over the original air pods.  they stay in my ears and sound amazing- im even getting warnings from my phone that ive exceeded the normal LOUDNESS USEAGE and that is just fine by me-  Listened to old PINK FLOYD digital lps (Medlle and Atom Hear Mother & DSOTM)  and the louder the better- sound is clean, crisp and no ear discomfort worth every cent', \"Everybody's ear canals are a little different and the size and shape affects the sound in ear monitors will deliver.  For my ears, and while using the noise cancellation (important for best sound) the AirPod Pros deliver a sound character that is very similar to my highly expensive full range monitors.  It's so nice to have something that sounds this good that I can take wherever I need to go.  I will repeat: the best sound is with the noise cancellation on.\", \"As a heavy user of good quality Bluetooth headphones, I am happy with the Airpods but I wouldn't personally use it over Jabra Elite 85t or the Samusug Buds Pro. Both are superior in quality, functionality and noise cancelation. I would say it's over rated and hyped. Try these ones and you will never use the Airpods Pro again. I bought this for my cousin and my wife because they have apple products but I would never use it now that I have better options.\", 'Nowhere in the description did I see refurbished or renewed. When I opened it came with a weird plastic around it. Obviously it had be used. When I tried it connect it said \"Luis\\' Airpods\". Bro. That\\'s ain\\'t right.', 'I was very skeptical at first , buying AirPod pros on Amazon especially because there so pricey but I’m very impressed, Amazon is very professional they were safely delivered to me and they function very well no scratches brand new! Working well it’s like I bought them right from apple if your skeptical due to functionalities I’d say don’t be go for it! If your hesitant due to having an older generation of air pods seeking to get the new ones I’d say mehh stick with the ones you have no need to upgrade!', 'Noise canceling works really good, as long as it’s not industrial noise. Then use ear plugs. Transparency works really well. Sound quality is really good, better than any other bud type ear devices I’ve used. Battery life is better than expected. Portability is excellent. Integration with Apple devices including Apple TV is flawless. Overall I’ve been extremely pleased with the Apple Airpod Pro.', 'My original order of AirPods are returned due to some defect as the switching noise cancelling and transparent wasn’t working. I got my replacement, and it’s working amazingly. I can’t express how much that improved my work from home meeting, as well as the music experience. I also jog everyday with it on, the size is perfect fit, no sign of slipping at all. Especially with the spatial audio that just got turned on with IOS14, which brought me to write the review. It worth every penny I spend.', \"I’ve had these for a few months now and have held off on reviewing ‘til now in an effort to wait out  the honeymoon phase of the purchase. My initial reaction to popping these bad boys into my ears was a strong and knee-jerk response of positivity and that opinion has mostly held firm over the last few months. The noise canceling feature is seriously impressive, the audio transparency's good as well, but all-in-all I’d say the most impressive thing about these earbuds is their sound quality. The sound is good! It’s worth the hype! The seal on the AirPod Pros makes a difference! They’re also incredibly comfortable. I forget I have them in at times and go about my day oblivious to the world around me. Not everything is perfect, of course. I’ve come from the Gear Icon-x and Galaxy Buds, and while the AirPod Pros are significantly better across the board, they’re also priced significantly higher. In fact, I’d say the biggest drawback to these is the price for me. Now don’t get me wrong, I feel like I’ve gotten my money’s worth as I’ve used these things everyday, which is surprising for me as my prior wireless and wired earbuds got significantly less use. Like, I’ve found myself looking for reasons and excuses to use these, whether it be by going out of my way to place calls or listen to music — or even trying out podcasts for the first time (I wasn’t really about podcasts before, but having something comfortable and convenient opened a gate.) The price is just a difficult pill to swallow. I haven’t use anything better, but that doesn’t mean something better doesn’t exist at a more reasonable price point. The reason I’m harping on price here is because the features on display (the noise cancellation, the audio pass through, the comfort, etc) have all been offered by different earbuds for less cost but I guess just not nearly as polished — and maybe that polished, well-rounded experience is what you’re paying a premium for. That perceived value is difficult to gauge. Anyway, all things said, the AirPod Pros are great and are a 100% a must buy (especially if on sale sub $200).\", 'I use these almost everyday and they are great. The transparency mode on these are amazing. I can hear my music and hear what others are saying at the same time.  The noise cancellation puts pressure on my ears over a long period of time so I tend to not use it as much, but noise cancellation is pretty good. The only problem I have with these is when I am running or eating they tend to get loose and want to fall out. Overall a great pair of earphones and an upgraded version of the regular AirPods.', 'The handoff functionality is excellent. Worth more than all the other features or lack thereof. My only complaint are 1) it picks up ambient noise too much, making phone calls while on the road unpleasant for the people I’m talking with and 2)  when I DON’T want the headphones to grab a call and they are on, they will keep grabbing the audio until I turn off Bluetooth for my phone entirely.', 'I’m disappointed with this product. I am hard of hearing and was looking forward to ear phones that would be loud and clear, better than my Bluetooth hearing aids. Not so. The loudest setting is very low. I needed ear phones for online conferencing. Not happy with volume, both on my iPhone and my Mac.  Apple should consider that they have large population of users that are hard of hearing. Please! Make them louder!!!', 'These are some great headphones,From immersive sound quality to clear crystal noise cancellation. My personal favorite is how portable it is.These earbuds slip in and out very effectively with amazing quality. There is only one problem I have with these headphones. Apple is a known brand with great products but the prices are steep. $245 earbuds are a very high price. it is worth it 100% but I would personally try to see if there are better deals out.', 'I was hesitant to treat myself to these; I\\'ve bought cheaper ones but until I purchased the airpods pro, did not realize how \"good\" music could sound from ear-buds :0  the noise cancellation and spatial audio is incredible, charge time is very long, and they fit really well. **The only problem I have ever had is when I\\'m working in the yard and get a bit sweaty; they will tend to fall out if you are not careful under these conditions. Other than that, Apple has got it going on..', 'I hesitated moving from my v2 AirPods to the AirPods Pro because I’m cheap and I had not had them very long. But, I was tired of the classics falling out of my ears all of the time & switching to wired was not an option for me. Best.Decision.Ever. to upgrade. Not only do they fit perfectly in my ear & stay put, the sound quality is just so much better. Love the ability to switch noise cancelling on and off depending on what is going on around me. Fantastic little beasts! (And the nice thing, I was able to easily sell my v2 to someone else!)', \"I am so happy I got these! I am a college student and it's safe to say that I use these every single day. I have never liked the feel of the traditional Apple earbuds/Airpods so this was a great solution. They come with different sized tips so you can have the best fit for you. The noise-canceling really works and it is incredible! I seriously cannot hear anything but what is playing through my Airpods Pro! They stay charged for what feels like forever! They sound awesome and have the best sound quality that I have ever experienced in an earbud. They are totally worth the money and I encourage you to spend the extra $100 if you want the best of the best!!\", 'These things have so much potential, but they are definitely not there yet! The fit is awful. They get painful after about an hour. They also trap moisture in your ear. The sound is incredibly good, but the functionality is trash. Every time you want to click the AirPod to advance a song or change a setting, they wiggle out of your ear, and, conversely, every time you want to adjust the AirPod, you will accidentally advance a song or change the noise cancellation settings. They are even hard to remove from the case. It is almost as though they didn’t go through a serious testing process before release. I returned them and am sticking with my AirPods classics!', \"I've had noise cancelling earphones before and i have airpod 2, didn't like these due to the pressure and that you can hear your own footsteps at low volume.  bought these because everyone gave great reviews online. They work fine when listening to music at high volume, pressure seems to go away and does pretty good job at noise cancelling. But, i do a lot of walking and i like to listen to music at relatively low volume, pressure is way too high for comfort and hate the thumping sound i hear in my ear with every step.  i hate to return stuff so gonna give it couple more tries but so far day 2 not good... (tried different size fit) Update: had them for few weeks now. Getting used to them.  They fit well.  Great on planes, trains, etc.  liking the fit of them, still don’t like the pressure too much.  Goes away at higher volumes.  Not bad.\", \"I have bought multiple ear buds, thought I would try the new airpods pro, so far they have been as good as advertised.  The noise cancellation has worked really good, but since I normally wear earbuds while mowing I will have to wait and see next year how they do.  Right now I believe they will work great.  I did buy the cord that connects each airpod so I won't lose them when mowing.  I mow with a kubota tractor, so I don't want to lose them.  Will review later on to provide an update.\", 'What I like: You can toggle between ambient mode or noise cancellation. If you have soft spoken friends this is a must. If your walking around and there’s a lot of noise, you can easily cancel out that and focus on what you are listening too. Battery life is great! The AirPods, one of my buds would constantly keep draining battery (very annoying) this doesn’t happen with the pro. What I don’t like: They can get very uncomfortable after wearing for a long period. If going for a run, they make a Subtle (thud) sound with every step that gives me a head ache.', \"I love these air pods.  To me the best feature is the transparency mode so that ambient conversations can still be heard. Works well for driving to hear traffic sounds. Call quality is perfect and people can't tell that I am talking to air pods.  My favorite feature is listening to tv without blowing the rest of the family out of the house.  I really have not found any feature that does not work really well.  This is my first attempt at Air Pods and I am very very happy that i went with Apple Air Pods Pro.\", \"Much better sound and fit than AirPods. Yet, not two months after purchase, the right AirPod has failed. Apple sent a replacement--with a $98 hold on my card to ensure the original one is returned--but the the replacement doesn't work either. Now Apple wants to send another replacement for another $98. Nope. Obviously Apple is trying to minimize its costs, but when its stores are closed and the replacement fails, it should just make the product right without extra hassle. 6/9 update: the second replacement AirPods unit failed to work. apple's solution is to send another one or wait until a store opens to take it in. Apple does not want to replace a $250 device so the customer receives the full benefit of the purchase.\", \"I have been eyeing these for quite a while. I was hesitant to purchase them do to the price, but I'm so glad I did. The noise canceling feature is by far my favorite. From blocking out the awful music played of my gym to the noises at the grocery store, these isolate your hearing to only what you want to listen to. I even use them at home when my washing machine, dryer, or dishwasher is running so that I don't have the listen to the obnoxious noises of those machines. These are extremely comfortable and stay in when doing vigorous cardio. I love that they are light too; I can barely feel them in my ears.\", \"I am very happy with the Airpods pro. They are more comfortable than the normal airpods because of the silicone tip. That in itself offers a good seal to reduce some of the outside noise.  They are a little better in sound quality than the normal airpods, but not as good as some of the better headphones out there. The noise cancelation is good, not great, as they are not as good as say Bose quiet comfort headphones. They do a great job on phone calls and reduce a lot of noise in your surroundings. I think these are the best combination of small earbuds with active noise cancellation available. So if you don't want big bulky over the ear headphones, these are a very good option.\", 'Between AirPods/2, PowerBeats 3, AirPods Pro, I like the sound of PowerBeats the best since they actual sound like they have some bass.  Apart from that preference, the AirPods Pro is my favored all around earbud/headphone.  The noise cancellation you get in such a small package, with the convenience of the charging case for easy carrying, makes it a fantastic overall package.  Very happy with the noise cancellation, but also like the easy toggling of transparency mode by squeezing the stalk which pipes in outside sound from the world around you so that you can have a quick conversation (and then go back to blissfully tuning the noise out!).', 'As an early adopter of the original Airpods, I was skeptical whether spending $200 on ANOTHER pair would net me any tangible benefits. I went with it and I do not regret it. These things are magical. They fit, they do not fall out, they cancel noise like magic, you can turn off the cancellation for \"pass through mode\" with a squeeze, and the noise cancellation effect doesn\\'t produce that \"head pressure\" sensation (for me, at least) that other noise cancellation devices produce. Also wireless charging. So here you go, Apple. My $200/month subscription to social status & relevance in public spaces.', 'I didn’t think I would need or use these and couldn’t justify the expense but after buying a pair for my daughter for her bday she convinced me to get them. Boy I’m glad I did. They are so convenient and easy to use and the battery lasts forever and charges while in the case. Can’t ask for more! Love these. If you are on the fence about getting them you should do it. WELL with the expense!', 'Did not give a 5 star for the simple fact these are not made for people with really small ears. They \"fit\" but will easily start to slide out after a few minutes of moving around (note that to mean after walking maybe 100 yards, and constantly have to adjust them to keep them in. If you get any sweat/water in your ear, forget about trying to keep them in, as it will be a losing battle from that point forward. Hoping a pair of smaller foam tips will help, but shall see.', 'First of all they were \"Like New- Item will come in original packaging.\"  AirPods sold and shipped from Amazon (189$).  Okay, so obviously the box came opened as I expected to be, they came with a sealed charger and the other size of ear tips.  When I open the AirPods case they were dirty, they looked like they had earwax on them...  (which is kind of weird since Amazon is supposed to \"professionally\" clean them) the case has a lot of noticeable scratches so they looked really used; and if I wanted scratched AirPods cases I would have bought the ones that where like 130$. Another important thing to notice is that the battery of the case has been running out really fast, I have been using them on their \"Off\" mode most of the time and just heard some music with the \"Transparency\" mode and I already need to charge them and I got them less than 24hs ago.  In conclusion, I\\'m kind of disappointed they\\'re not exactly what I expected, I needed to buy another pair of earphones because my other AirPods G1 battery life was trash and now that I got these ones they\\'re basically the same...', 'What a waste of money! 1- Battery dies very soon.   2-when I placed inside the the charger “box”  it won’t charge at all.   3- Battery box lasts for a very short time.   4- they do not connect easily.   5- they fall out of the ear.   I have the generation 2 and those the box lasts for almost a week or more, depends on how much I use them. 1- se descargan muy pronto. 2- los metes en la caja y no se cargan. 3- a la caja le dura muy poco tiempo la carga. 4- no se conectan fácilmente. 5- se caen del oído. Yo tengo los generation 2 y esos la caja les dura por casi una semana o más  la carga depende cuanto los use.', \"After losing my wired earbuds, I was looking for a good wireless earbuds to use for my phone. After reading all the reviews and watching videos of reviews, I decided these were the best option for me. They work great together with Siri, giving me a hands free experience of listening to my music and the noise cancellation works great to drown out the sounds of the outside world. Would definitely recommend it even though they are pricey, in the long run, they're worth it.\", \"There isn't much to be said that hasn't been said about the Pros. I find it way better than my fake ones as I had some really cheap fake ones that died after charging in 20 minutes. These last literal hours as I bus two hours one way and don't need a charge at all. I charge them when I get home like 6+ hours later. They auto stop playing when removed which is nice if I say meet a friend and pull them out for 10 or so minutes but bad if you need to adjust them as I forgot to mess around with them after I got them settings wise. Great out of the box. Would buy again.\", 'For reference, I have the iPhone 11 Pro, iMac (Big Sur), and have had these airpods for 2 months. 1. Rubber earbud ripped.

My environment is Apple but not for music.', 'Item is legit, came with original package. I was a bit worried since amazon sells it at a discounted price compare to Apples website. But it is the original. No problem so far, love the noise canceling part. Really blocks the low ends noise such as street cars, gardening, TV etc. high pitch sound will be reduced, but still could still hear it slightly. Great for studying or just want to have some quietness.  Definitely worth the price. However, I can  only wear it on my right ear long time, but not the left ear. Both fits well, but just one side can wear longtime. Could be my own reason, and my own ear structure. Don’t get how some people can wear it for whole days.', 'After about a year of use, only one earbud connects at time and there is a lot of static.  80% of the time, just the right earbud connects and 20% just the left one.  Now both earbuds never connect at the same time.  I reached out to Apple, through the website chat function, for support; my two options are to either drive two hours (round trip) to an Apple Store or pay $250 to mail it in for service. I was shocked that I had to pay $250 for warranty service or waste two hours of my time.  I pointed out that for less than $250 I could buy new ones.  This is horrible customer service and was not what I expected from Apple.', 'These things have been out for a long time and there are a ton of high quality reviews.  The in the ear fit doesn’t bother me a bit.  Noise cancellation is amazing.  Seriously.  Stop second guessing your self.  Buy the things (if they are on sale - $180 or less - if not wait until the next sale)', \"Bought a pair from Verizon and the box came empty. Still no call back. Bought a pair from Amazon and loved them. Lost that one. I’m now on my third pair and still love them. My only complaint however is that I have developed an allergy to the silicon tips and have had to buy a different pair of tips. Hopefully I won’t lose these before the new tips arrive. Update, after buying at least ten different ear tips, I've had to give all these air Pod pros to my husband and revert back to the original air Pods.  I liked the tips because the pods stayed in the ear better, and the noise cancelling was awesome.  After three trips to the doctor to get my ears cleared up from the horrible blisters I got from the silicone, I'll stick with the oldies but goodies.\", \"My wife and I loved out AirPod Pro earbuds when  we first received them but basically can not wear them now because our ear canals break out with something like a rash. I looked on Apple's Support Page and MANY people have had this same issue. Washing and sanitizing the rubber tips have not helped.\", \"After testing several sets of earbuds I decided to give airpods a try. I hate the fit and feel of in-ear canal earbuds, but the airpod pro's don't go inside tha ear canal, instead, they form a seal on the outside. It's like a hybrid of in-ear and semi-in ear. These fit great! I'm an android user and have never owned an apple phone. They connect seamlessly with my Note 10. I also downloaded assistant trigger from the play store and can now take advantage of the same features available with iOS products for the airpods. If you're an android user airpods will work for you.\", \"I was super careful with my airpods and kept them in a case.  They were never affected by moisture either. After having them for about 6 months, the left airpod started to get staticky sounding. I tried everything the website suggested to fix this issue, and they still didn't work. Last week, they were low on battery, so I plugged them in.  They died and haven't turned back on. I've tried several charges with no luck and can't figure out what the problem is.\", \"These are the authentic Apple AirPods Pro. New in box, everything in order and working as it should. No complaint, I got them cheaper than the Apple official website.

Fully recommend buying them here since you won't get a better offer. The only downsize is that the battery doesn't last very long.\", \"I didn't keep this item but I did like it. It is amazing at noise cancellation options, great sound quality, and fantastic battery life. However, I did not like the fit in my ear. No matter what ear piece I used it was too tight or so loose it fell out. I do have quite small ears but I couldn't find a good fit. I also didn't like the headaches this caused me. I would listen to music and then immediately get a headache. If you struggle with headphones fitting I would go for the regular airpods instead.\", 'Seems like the battery life could be better. I get about 3 or 4 hours on a charge. They fit like old fashioned ear buds with the rubber caps - which after a while start to hurt the ears. The gen 1 earbuds that are hard plastic wear much better and seem to hold a charge better, but the gen 2 have much better sound quality and the noise cancellation is awesome where it come to wearing when cutting the grass or in a noisy place.', 'Not worth the money. In my opinion, Galaxy buds plus are better. The battery life of the airpods suck compared the the Galaxy buds plus. Not just by a couple of hours, but they can go 3 times longer (12hrs vs 4hrs).

Im returning these and getting the galaxy buds plus.', 'The noise cancellation on these is amazing. I can vacuum or run a blender or do all sorts of loud things with these in and I literally can’t hear anything but my music. I went ahead with the pros because the regular AirPods shape hurt my ears. I’m glad I went with the pros, they fit in my ears and I can wear them for hours at a time, way longer than I could wear the original shaped AirPods. They connect quick and simple to my iPhone.  The charging case is super handy and all the actions you can do from the AirPods themselves is super great.  Honestly I don’t have a complaint about them.', \"These are great sounding earbuds. I have apple products like an iPhone and MacBook Pro and they pair perfectly, and have great technology. Unfortunately, they don't fit my ears and fall out all the time, even with the biggest size tips in them. I also got some third party memory foam tips and they don't work either. I never get a good fit with the iPhone test, so I'm sure I'm not even hearing the best sound they can offer. Totally frustrating because I really wanted to like them, but I can't get them to work for me. It's now too late to return them, so I'm stuck with them i guess. I've seen lots of people with this problem, and unfortunately I have it too. It seems there is no solution offered from Apple. Very disappointed and frustrated.\", 'So while everything said about it is true from noise cancellation to quality of sound. But I hated how they get placed in my air.

It only cancel out the surrounding sounding in which your caller could still hear.  Battery life does not last long; however, with the wireless charger it doesn’t take long for them to charge back up.

That made ZERO difference.', 'I’ve always resisted paying this much for ear pods or headphones, but I finally bit the bullet. I’m so glad I did. They fit perfectly, sound really great and the noise cancellation is excellent. Plus, the wireless charging case always keeps them topped off. Wish I had gotten them sooner.

Given you were in a quiet public office, it is really wired to call out \"SIRI\" simply for get volumn down...', 'I love my AirPods but I will say I think they are a little over priced. I was pleasantly surprised with the comfort level of these. The regular ones hurt my ears but these do not. I can wear them for several hours for work with no problems. I have been a bit disappointed by the battery level compared to more generic brands I’ve used, but they charge pretty quick in their case. Overall, I’m glad I made the purchase.', \"The quality and integration are what you would expect from Apple. However, I was expecting to be blown-away with the sound quality which I wasn't. No doubt it's very good. But I did side-by-side comparisons with my $35 Boltune BLE earbuds that I bought last year, and they sound almost identical. I'm also disappointed that I can't change the volume with the AirPods Pro... Seriously? You have to change the volume on your source or by asking siri to change the volume. All you can do is skip tracks, pause, play, and change between noise cancelation mode and transparency mode by squeezing the stem of the AirPods Pro.  I was also disappointed that they don't respond to taps on the side like the original AirPods. Super cheap bluetooth earbuds can both change volume and respond to taps.\", \"I wanted to love these and keep them, but even with all the ear-piece options included in the box, these just were not comfortable for me. I know many people who have them and love them, but they didn't stay in my ears. If you can get to an Apple Store someday, see if you can try them first before making the plunge. Ultimately, I bought another pair of first-generation AirPods and am very pleased.\", 'I wanted to buy a set of bluetooth headphones that sounded similar to the original wired headphones that came with my IPhone XR.  I started at the >$100 range by reading many reviews, after choosing a well known brand I was very surprised on how horrible the sound quality was, I spent close to $100 and the sound quality was like a wired $4.99 pair of headphones, simply atrocious. I returned them and decided to go up to the $150 range. Once again, the sound quality was nothing like the wired headphones that come with the IPhone, I would say that they barely sounded like a $20 pair of regular wired headphones, if that at all. I then was almost convinced that I would never have the same sound with a pair of bluetooth. Before giving up, I added another $100 bucks and got myself the Airpods Pro. I have to say I was blown away to hear the amazing depth and detail in the sound quality. And on top of that, every other aspect of the headphones is incredible: incredibly comfortable (i.e. you forget you have them on), yet they will never fall out of your ears, amazing battery like and the case charges very fast, they sound great on phone calls (both incoming and outgoing audio quality), fantastic noise cancellation (I can mow the lawn and barely hear the lawn mower) and the transparency mode is great too, I can listen to tunes and also hear my wife blabbing away without annoying her... Sure, these are pretty expensive compared to others, but they are by far the best bang for your buck you will get. Your ears are important, spend a little more now and be extremely happy, you deserve it!', 'These worked great, until they stopped working. They stopped working (they won’t turn on and the charging case isn’t working) 47 days after I received them, which is conveniently after the Amazon 30 day return window. Amazon customer service was not helpful and would not do anything to rectify the issue. I’m not sure if Amazon is selling defective products or what the issue is. It’s truly disappointing because I really loved these, but cannot afford to buy a new pair every 47 days.', 'Yes, the noice cancellation on the PRO is excellent.  It stops there.  would connect seamlessly with whatever Apple product I wanted it to.  If I change iPhones with the PRO, I have to “forget” and re-pair every time!.  Battery life is worse than old ones.  Hangs up if you slightly touch it.  Even with the different sized ear buds, still not a good fit, and comes out easier than the old ones.  This is the first Apple product I have ever hated.  AirPod PRO is a swing and a miss.', 'I despise these. Bought them for work on my HP laptop but also to use when using my IPhone or Apple laptop. In one week I have reset these daily. They won’t stay connected to anything. In addition, I have tried multiple ear sizes and they don’t seem to stay put. I honestly don’t have a clue how these can be used for any activity. I love every Apple product I’ve had going back at least twenty years now but these are going back', 'Purchased these in preparation of having to WFH due to COVID-19 and they have not disappointed.  Easily worked out of box...comfortable...exceedingly functional and the noise cancelling is phenomenal.  In fact noise canceling feature works so well my wife was initially upset thinking I was ignoring her when I simply never heard her.  The only regret I have is not purchasing them earlier. Suggestion:  Buy some AHASTYLE Ear Hooks to prevent the airpod’s from falling out randomly.', 'Good headphones. Pros- noice cancellation is great. Sound is pretty good. Fit and feel is great, Cons- wish they were louder. Main issue is that the left headphone frequently doesn’t charge. Separate issue: the left headphone very frequently doesn’t connect when it’s fully charged. I have to put both back into the case, close the lid put them back on and that seems to do the trick. Overall- 4/5. If these were 50-100 bucks they would be 5/5 but for the price, they should be near flawless.', 'Battery lasts the same as the 2nd gen AirPods when your listening to music constantly but they’re wireless so I guess 🤷🏽\\u200d♀️ noise cancellation is awesome and they stay in my ears and don’t hurt my ears unlike the 2nd generation AirPods. quite pricey compared to previous model and also doesn’t say crap about needing a new block to even use the charger 😑😑😑😑😑 but I like them better so again I guess 🤷🏽\\u200d♀️🤷🏽\\u200d♀️🤷🏽\\u200d♀️', \"I tried out a few different bluetooth wireless earbuds before going for the AirPod Pros. I had the regular AirPods before, until they were stolen. They were good quality and as an Apple user, they're very easy when connecting to the devices. That was my biggest issue when trying out different earbuds, they would disconnect so often where I'd constantly have to reset them and I have yet to have this issue with these earbuds. With other earbuds, I did have excellent fit which I expected to have with the Pros as that's one of the claimed improvements compared to the regular AirPods. For my ears, they are still too big and slip out all the time. I had to buy replacement attachments for them to stay in my ears finally. Another benefit is that you can use either earbud at a time. Some bluetooth earbuds, I've only been able to use the Left one if I wanted to use a single one. But the battery isn't very impressive which is why I tend to use a single AirPod at a time. The case does have a long battery life too though! Overall, if you're not an Apple user or have multiple Apple products then you can surely find other options!\", \"I bought these to replace my standard Airpods, which I lost. They work fine for music but I work from home and primarily use them for meetings all day every day. The sound quality during videoconferences is horrible. They emit a horrible static and crackling sound that gets worse the more people that are in a meeting.  I've used them for Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings and they are equally bad in both. I took them to the Apple store and the audio diagnostic test said they were fine, but they definitely are not. I tried turning off the noise cancellation, transparency, adjusting noise and sound settings in the VC apps, turning off all other bluetooth devices - nothing worked. I bought another pair of standard Airpods and I'm returning the Pro's.\", 'I had the AirPods for couple of years, and when the AirPods pro came out there were lots of hype about this new model. I was reluctant to spend another $250 for something I thought will just have the same sound quality and performance as the AirPods. Contrary to my believe, this is the best noise canceling earbuds comparing to all the others I had, such as the Bose on ears and in ears,etc. and the sound quality has improved due to the better noise canceling feature. I’m sold the minute I put these on. I travel quite frequently and these are very comfortable to wear during the long hours trip. Two thumbs up !', 'I’ve the pros for a month and as a conservative spender/shopper these earbuds were a great investment. Pros: Comfortable Performs as instructed (great sound quality, transparency,etc.) Lightweight Easy to carry/store around Fast charge time Cons: Earbud fitting (when doing HIT workouts i.e jump roping the earbuds will fall out) Insides of earbuds get dirty easily I have to clean them out daily Battery life (4 hours is not enough for the price of the product.  6 hours or more would have done the trick) Price (realistically I think the retail price should be $150 but it’s apple so they inflate the price) Wear and tear will definitely show (so treat them with care) All in all good purchase, would recommend to a friend also I’ve never owned the original airpods so I wouldn’t know the sound difference.', \"There are many options when it comes to truly wireless earphones but the airpods might be the most known and for good reason. Apple added noice cancellation to the pro which pushed me to buy it even as an Android user. I am impressed with the sound quality and the noice cancellation, the noice cancellation isn't over ear headphone quality but for an in ear headphone it's phenomenal. I would recommend these earphones to anyone even non apple users.\", \"I had a previous version of airpods and they were lost pretty quickly since they get loose within seconds while you are in a store picking something. Airpods pro will stay within your ear very well, it's expensive and definitely not worth 250 ( apple obviously knows how to price their products : ) but with not many alternatives I prefer them compared to other non-apple named options.  Noise-canceling option just OK, but the transparency option is a key not to get full ear sensation.\", 'Loving it. I like how I can switch between noise cancellation and not, so I can still hear everything around me especially when I’m using it at work. I can converse with people while listening to music.  The sound is great when noise cancellation is on. The battery life is excellent, if I only use one ear piece at a time I could use it all day for two days on one charge. I’m very happy with this purchase.', 'I did not realize how often I would use wireless earbuds that work well. These have all the features I wanted to be able to wear them to work all day without issues. The battery lasts a long time. The transparency mode is a lifesaver so I can hear the office phone ring or people coming up the stairs to the main office. I am not in my own, silent world. I can hear my music or audiobooks as well as everything around me!', 'What can I say?  Sure they sound great.  Noise cancellation is really cool, too.  I’ve owned a lot of regular airPODS  and they give you a reasonable 2-3 hour battery life, but this PRO model is totally unsatisfactory as I can’t get through a single 45 minute phone call without getting the low battery warning.  It loses 15% battery life in just a 5-minute call!  And it takes WAY longer to charge than the basic air pods.  And all of that was with the noise cancellation feature OFF!', \"Airpod Pro 2's come with a wireless charging case included. Normal non-Pro Airpods do not include wireless charging and to purchase one you will be paying about $70. When you add that price to the price of regular Airpods, you are shorting yourself the far more superior Airpod Pro 2's with the sickest new audio technology around - SPATIAL AUDIO !!! Coupled with active noise cancellation and that charger, you are getting so many more miles out of this purchase than regular Aipods. BOOM! Thank me after you make the purchase because of this review and experience Spatial Audio for the first time. Learning to take them out of the case is the only slight learning curve which is super easy once you figure it out - everything else, flawless. PRICE / VALUE = AMAZING.\", 'When the original AirPods came out, I bought them, and returned them three weeks later. No matter what I did, they just kept falling out of my ear. And as I recall, the sound was OK but nothing great. These are a different story. Still not a perfect fit--maybe I have wierd ears--but good enough that I am very happy with them. Great sound, comfortable. Easy to forget you are wearing them. My only complaint is the relatively short battery life. But I can get used to that.', 'Got the, on sale and to be honest, I thought they could be knock offs.  But these are the originals, and I just lucked into one of Amazon’s best temporary deals ever at about 40% of regular price.  These ear buds are just awesome.  They are very comfortable to wear, and produce amazing sound.  They pair automatically with whatever iOS device I’m holding and produce phenomenal sound.  From telephone conversations, the microphone on these is also very capable.  Highly recommend these', 'I didn’t like the original AirPods mainly because it wouldn’t stay in my ears and the annoyingly long stem. With the Pro, not only did Apple fix both of these issues by using adjustable ear tip sizes and shrinking the stem, but added noise cancellation as well. I found the small ear tips to fit me perfectly and haven’t had an issue with them falling out. Audio quality has also improved from the original, most notably was that I could actually hear and feel the bass very well. Noise cancellation makes your music sound feel more immersive. However, you have to really secure these things for noise cancellation to work at it’s best. This has become a bit of an inconvenience as they occasionally loosen up while I’m exercising. There are also sweat resistant which makes them more ideal to bring to the gym. And of course, automatically pair and turn on/off with your iOS device. Overall, AirPods Pro is worth the extra cost mainly for the noise cancellation and adjustable tips. One complaint is that these don’t come with a power brick so you’ll have to take turns on who gets the charger. Thankfully they have a long battery life and charge much quicker than an iPhone so you can easily work these in between phone charges', 'While they do occasionally need to be shoved back into place, they stay in better than any ear bud I’ve encountered to date. This has been personally tested under active workouts, construction, and on a commercial zero turn mower. As for every day use, they last with their charge and the range amazes me. Going grocery shopping? Goodbye other customers. I highly recommend these.', 'I was so excited to get these but ended up massively disappointed.  (1) they are uncomfortable.  I can wear the cheap, standard, wired iPhone earbuds for much much longer before they bother me. (2) sound quality for talking on phone is poor. I can hear just fine, but the volume and clarity constantly changes for the person on the other end (how they hear me).  (3) noise cancelling does not work well.  On a  recent flight, I had a super loud talker two seats away from me.  The noise cancelling muted the loud din of the plane itself and amplified the loud talker- so it was even worse with them on!', 'All right, this is my honest review. Basically, when I first receive them, I was a little on expecting at this sheer size of these. They are smaller, but have a far greater width, they’re pretty white, but they have a nice comfortable your pieces that way you can customize it, these work very well, I love how you could change it to playing music, and you being able to hear yourself. Also the white noise, noise cancellation are amazing features, you could honestly fall asleep in these, we just have silent noise cancellation feature is. Although these headphones are clunky, they are fairly worth it, especially in the music department, because it sounds like they’re playing live, we’re honest review, as I gave these around 4-4.5 stars these headphones do very well in sound quality, and noise cancellation department, however they don’t have the best battery life... Thank you for reading my (first day) review.', 'For how much these things cost, the battery life on them is totally disruptive to any prolonged or planned activity; I wish I could return them. They’re stated I believe to last 4 hours but it’s definitely shorter than that. Want to keep them charged when not in use? Have fun carrying around the case everywhere like a pack of gum. Now you have three tiny objects that are all easy to lose. Want to charge them while you use them? Doesn’t work that way. The case needs to be charged up, then the airpods must be inside it to in turn get charged. To add, the noise cancellation isn’t as good as the ads claim. You can hear a ton of stuff happening around you. If strong cancellation is your goal, even these in-ear options leave a lot to be desired.', 'I’ve been hesitant about getting the AirPods Pro even after my AirPods stopped working. But I decided to give them a try and right out the box I was wondering why I waited this long. The noice cancellation is amazing especially once you find the right ear tips. Transparency mode really sound as if you don’t have anything in your ears. Apple hasn’t disappointed me yet and once again I’m very satisfied with my purchase.', 'There isn’t really anything to write other than it’s an apple product and they always are top notch. I love the noise cancellation, it works really well. And when we have it off, Instead of feeling like you have ear plugs in and still kinda hard to hear people, it’s almost like it has a mic on it that projects in to your ear so you can hear people. It’s pretty neat. Also, I wear mine for at least 4-5 hours a day and I only charge them like once every 3-4 days. Love them.', \"Let's get this straight. For $250, you expect good sound quality and overall battery life. Definite check on battery life but sound quality is only okay. If you're spending $250, you might as well shell out an additional $50 to get a pair of **Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2**. They're worth it for the price unlike these AirPods Pro. I'm not saying it's a terrible purchase but the price tag for this quality isn't right. As some of you have taken Economics, you'd know that any product's price is determined by how much people are willing to pay for such item. This goes true for almost everything. Apple in general sells products at extremely marked up price nearly 2-5x more than the production cost. Of course majority of this profit doesn't go back into the company for R&D, it's mainly goes into their pockets. The noise cancellation is great, I've even tested this while riding at certain speeds with from 25mph to 85mph. The wind becomes audible around 60-65mph. Of course going faster, the wind gets louder but it's actually not bad at all. Aesthetically, they're smaller than the 1st gen which is good as I can keep it hidden and safely wear it with my full face helmet. Overall, for $250 these are overly priced, if it somehow was marketed around $160-$200, the price would definitely be worth but not for $250. You're better off with lesser known brands that have the same quality for a cheaper price or if money was no issue, those Sennheisers are definitely the go-to.\", 'These are great! The sound quality is really good and I’m very shocked at how well the noise cancellation is. It’s not 100% but it really cuts it down. Sometimes I just use them as earplugs.. The battery could last a bit longer but it’s not bad. Also. I wish there was a way to just have one in your ear and not both.. but if you take one eat out then it automatically shuts off. The range on these is pretty good too. Overall 5 stars.', 'I am a critical listener and was pretty disappointed by these. I also have Sony and Samsung wireless in-ear\\'s, and both have better audio quality. The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ don\\'t even have active noise cancelling, but they tend to isolate me better while sounding better. I also enjoy their fit and comfort more. The Sony\\'s noise cancellation and audio quality is in a different class altogether, but they are bulky and uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. The only saving grace for the Airpods Pro is that they fit the Apple aesthetic/ecosystem and you can feel like you\\'re part of the \"in crowd.\" Oh, and my girlfriend loves them. ;)', 'The AirPods Pro are definitely not the best when it comes to sound quality, but they are not terrible either. The different ear tips may help you find a more comfortable able fit, but if you are unlucky the seams on the AirPods may poke your ears. On average, they will last around 3 to 4 consecutive hours if you do not return them to the charging case. I was however very surprised on how quickly the AirPods charge when they are in the case. About 10 minutes in the case will get you to about 30-50% battery.', \"I debated a long time about getting these. My other (wired) Apple ear buds would tend to slip out of my ears but I thought, what the heck, I'm worth it so I bought them. The silicone tips make them much more secure and I'm sure add to the noise cancellation though I rarely am in a position where I would wear them in a noisy situation. I can listen to music or watch a movie on my laptop while my wife watches a tv show in the same room and have no trouble hearing.\", 'I would not say these are noise cancelling at all! I go to Bose for that. Apple pisses me off. You have to use a special charger and cannot use a regular iPhone charger. Great job Apple making people buy more products. Somebody has to sync all charger wires.  It’s getting ridiculous and is bad for the environment when disposing of multiple wires.', 'These things have changed my daily life! Talk about making it SO much easier to answer the phone now when at work, or while doing things around the house! Pop one or both of these babies in and away you go - hands free life! Its SSSOOO worth the investment! My ONLY complaint would be the battery life could be longer. I love using these while mowing the lawn, vacuuming the home - turn on the noise cancellation and jam out while getting housework done!', \"I was skeptical, but these really are amazing. Working perfectly with my Pixel 3a. I think I'm missing some iPhone-specific minor features, but the ANC, controls, and transparent mode all work well still on Android. The noise cancellation is a game changer that I didn't expect. I can listen to music comfortably at low volume even when in a noisy environment. Transparent mode is super useful. $200 is steep for headphones, but after being skeptical and trying them, I'm a big fan.\", \"The sound quality is pretty good.  I use them primarily when I exercise, so I was a little nervous about keeping them in my ears.  However, they seem to fit pretty well.  I do have to adjust from time to time.  But, the major problem . . . only 6 weeks after purchasing them, I had to get a replacement case because the one I purchased stopped working.  That's outrageous.  If I'm going to throw down that much money on this device, they should outlast the cheapo Walmart stuff.\", 'I was very skeptical about airpods since they came out. When I saw the commercial for airpods pro, I thought it was an even bigger waste of money to buy them for noise canceling versus Bose or Sony headphones. As a Sony headphone owner and airpod pro owner, I am beyond happy with the airpods pro. Headphones give you a headache after long wear, but the airpods do not. I am unsure if it is because of my daith piercings but the inside of my ears do become uncomfortable after about 4 hours of having the airpods in without breaks. I do not get headaches though and love this purchase.', 'As per usual with Apple, the cost leaves you feeling frustrated. The company doesn\\'t appeal to the masses, it appeals to those with sizable disposable incomes. Which is disappointing. As far as the Air Pod Pros, they are good, but far from \"all that.\" The noise cancellation isn\\'t comparable to what over-the-head earphones will provide, so don\\'t buy the Pods for that feature. Sound quality is good and battery life is decent - not exceptional. They also transition easily to other Apple devices conveniently.', 'Pros: Small, easy to sync between devices, great sound quality, able to say \"Hey Siri...\" and change songs, like the noise cancel option, and being able to use only 1 pod at a time Cons: -Falls out of ears constantly: HAD TO BUY something to hold them in place, and the hard plastic is still uncomfortable after a while where it rests in the ear canal -Did not come with a wall plug, only a USB 3.0 cable, HAD TO BUY that extra adapter -Not intuitive and the directions are not comprehensive, had to google to figure out how to charge them', 'When I hooked these up to my Iphone they came up as \"Emily\\'s AirPods Pro\" right out of the box, meaning they had to have been paired and had the name changed while hooked up to another phone at some time in the past. The packaging was shrink wrapped and appeared to be new at first, but couldn\\'t possibly be new. They do appear to be actual Apple products based on the serial number and function, just used.', 'These are a game changer. I have had the gen 1 AirPods for a little over a year now and haven’t used them much bc of the fact I felt they didn’t fit my ear well. It always felt loose and that they were going to fall out (and they were slipping out all the time), so I ordered these hoping it would fix my problem. And they did. I’ve been wearing them nonstop since I got them and I can say they hold their “seal” very well. They feel a lot more lightweight then the gen 1/2 AirPods, and the new transparency and noise cancellation modes are neat. Hearing the difference is pretty cool, and I’d say it is worth the investment. Tl;dr — better fit then gen 1/2 if you find them sliding out over time. Transparency mode/noise cancellation mode is pretty dope. Authentic Apple AirPod Pros.', \"Honestly, these are the best earbuds I've ever had. I've been trying to find a quality pair for a long time and, after about two weeks, I can say I am extremely pleased with the Apple AirPods Pro. The sound quality is great, noise cancellation pretty close to perfect, and comfort is good. I'm a runner and have used these now both outdoors (in chilly cold New Jersey and sunny hot Florida), as well as on the treadmill and THEY STAYED IN MY EARS THE WHOLE TIME! Also, they stayed in my ear without me constantly having to adjust during my runs. I did buy the additional ear hooks, just to play safe, but truth be told, I don't need them. I've also used them for work/personal phone calls and virtual meetings (Zoom, Microsoft Teams) and they were perfect. Very easy to sync with my laptop. Also easy to sync with my other technology. Very highly recommend.\", 'I have had several pair of ear buds . From skull candy to iPods . My favorite was skull candy until these AirPod  pros. I absolutely love these. The regular air pods hurt my ears. These air pod pros have the soft tips for your ears. The sound canceling is the bomb. You can have them in your ears and set them to hear everything around Nd audio from the phone or what ever your listening to. Or fix it so you hear nothing around you but the music or book .... what ever your into . These are well worth the money.', 'I am sorry to have to write a bad review on these, but they never worked correctly.  We received them and the left pod charged up, but the right one never charged correctly, only to less than 10% battery life, and was hot as an iron all of the time.  I needed to get a replacement ordered, and unfortunately, Amazon send me the wrong item as the replacement instead of new airpods (multiple items on the order I had placed), so that delayed us getting these even longer.  This was just a bad luck order that is unfortunate.', \"I have had many headphones, wired and wireless, over the years and none have served me better than the AirPods series. I bought the Gen. 1 AirPods and used them until they gave out and invested in a pair of AirPods Pros. I love the way the sound and the noise cancellation is amazing too. I think the noise cancellation could be slightly better, but I still gave it a 5/5 since it is great for what it is. I take these everywhere I can. The battery life is also great, I can't officially say the run time, but I've gotten about 5+ hours depending on volume and noise setting.\", 'Bought these and immediately heard crackling noise from the left one. Had to go to Apple Store for support. Apple tested it and said it was bad, replaced the left one, left me to pair it all back up myself. Tried to connect to my MacBook Pro (current OS 11.5.1), says they connect, but then drops off and never connects again. Tired of this, my old Beats worked better than these. Also, the smooth plastic makes it hard to get them out of the charging box.', 'Ok, so I really really wanted to love these. I tried everything. I turned them upside down. I changed the tips. I did the ear fit test. I bought new tips from Comply. But none of that helps when it’s the plastic part rubbing against my cartilage!  I just couldn’t wear them. But- I LOVED the controls, the sound quality was great, and pretty much everything else about them was perfect. If they hadn’t rubbed my ears sore I’d still have them!', \"I absolutely LOVE these earbuds. I was scared getting them because Apple's normal wired earbuds do not fit my ears and keep falling out but I decided to try these out. Once I found the correct tip, everything was golden. My only complaint is that they are very easy to misplace and the Apple Find My Product app only registers the location of the last time they were activated which really is not a lot of help. It would be great if they were somewhere in my house and my iPhone would be able to send out a signal to them to make a sound so I could locate them.\", 'Obsessed. I used to be on my soapbox against AirPods but these so quickly became one of my favorite things. Doing chores (even noisy ones) and listening to podcasts just got 100% easier. I also love being able to go for bike rides and walks with these on transparency mode, it makes it easy to listen to what you want and be aware of your surroundings. I’m obsessed. Battery life is meh but they charge quick and it’s great that the case keeps a charge', 'I was very skeptical with this purchase but am so happy I took the risk. The sound is great. The noise canceling feature works wonders. They are PERFECT for small ears! I have a pair of noise canceling Bose ear pods and I love the sound but the do not stay in my ears! I hated that. Always having to shove them as far in as possible only to have them fall right out. So frustrating. These stay in without any problem! I am so happy with these. I haven’t had any issues so far they are pretty perfect.', \"I had the original Airpods but I couldn't run any outdoor equipment like a mower and still hear them. The active noise cancelling feature is simply outstanding. It eerily silences everything around you. The mower can still be heard but barely. Other reviews say the audio quality isn't the best available but I think it's excellent, although I'm no expert either. One feature I miss is the tap controls of the original pods. It's beyond me why they got rid of it but the squeeze controls are nowhere near as convenient. Overall, I would highly recommend these.\", 'What I love is how easy they are to use, and that  they immediately connect to the phone. I also love the noise cancellation feature!! I  wish there was a way to raise or lower the volume without touching the phone, it’s not a huge deal as the phone is often nearby but it would be convenient if they had the option. The battery doesn’t seem to hold all that long but all I do is place them back in the little container and they will recharge rather quickly..I just simply plug the whole thing in at night and the container easily holds the charge the next day. But I’ve been on flights and noticed the buds themselves needed recharging after watching a long movie Or a couple of hours .', \"They work GREAT for road cycling!!! The noise cancellation cuts down wind noise by A LOT. With other earbuds, even with ANC, wind noise was a big problem. I had to crank up the volume, and with a strong headwind, I couldn't hear anything. With the apple buds and ANC on, even strong headwinds noise is cut down significantly. Music comes through and podcasts sound great. I'm sure not having to crank up the volume must be good for ear health and preventing hearing damage. They are snug and even going over road bumps is not a problem. The only caveat - be careful if you ride on roads with a lot of traffic. The ANC is so good, you won't hear pedestrians, other cyclists, and car motor noise is basically gone (all cars sound electric!!!). In this situation, turn ANC off for safety.\", 'I’m on my second pair of these because I love them. But they malfunction way too fast. I’m pretty tech savvy and tried everything I could think of and look up but nothing worked. The first ones lasted maybe a week then had connection and charging issues. Luckily they replaced them with different ones. Those ones lasted a month and now only one will play music. The other one charges and the touch And noise canceling works, just no sound. I’ve heard about this happening to many other people. You would think with how expensive they are that they would last at least a year. Apple failed big on this one.', 'What I enjoy most about these is the sound quality, while they may not get as loud as I would like them to I appreciate that they maintain the same stellar quality rather than just creating a bunch of noise. The noise canceling feature works great and tunes most everything out but I can still hear when people are talking or trying to get my attention. I don’t like that the case is typically dirty due to the fact that I work with metal and the shavings stick to the magnets inside the case but it’s not hard to wipe off. Would recommend to others', \"Pro: Fast bluetooth pairing speed.   Super easy to setup. (of course, it has the homecourt advantage)   Excellent interface with IPhone.   Noise cancellation is magical.   Great battery life.   Very Light weight.   Sound quality is great.   Mic is great. Con: It fell out of my ear couple times already during my workout. I'd tried all the sizes of adapters it provided.   Make sure you push them hard into your ears to get a tight snug so they won't fall out easily.\", 'These fit my tiny ears with the smallest size. Thank you Apple. I would not say the sound quality Of these is great especially at this price point. There are much better options under 200.  I like the integrate with all my Apple devices and Easy to find. I did experience status but maybe it’s a range thing in not sure. Apple needs to improve the quality of their products at this price point because once Apple is not trendy anymore they will lose market share. Make a better product at these prices.', \"I had a difficult time understanding how to recharge the battery case. There wasnt one power adapter I owned that connected to the female end of the lightening cable that came with the air pod pros. The battery case will recharge will a Q1 wireless charge pad. This information came from my sister, not Apple. My battery case was down to 8% power left. You'll need to purchase a 20W USB-C power adapter to recharge the battery case. I was upset when this item was not included. Be aware...otherwise I Love Love Love these!!!!!\", \"Kept disconnecting from my non Apple phone and I kept having to reset them. Apparently this isn't a new thing to occur with Apple ear buds. Also, no app to download for other feature except on an Apple phone. So like Apple products. Ridiculous. Also wouldn't connect with my non Apple laptop. Everything else was great. Ended up returning due to connection issues and the fact that they make it difficult for you to use them without their sister products. This is why I hate Apple.\", 'Absolutely amazing! I was hesitant spending $250 on AirPods Pro but well worth it. I loved the original  AirPods. Then when these came out I saw that they had noise cancellation, ear tips, and a shorter stem I really wanted to buy these. Very comfortable in the ear. The original AirPods were always ok to me, but these take it to a whole other level. When putting them in I almost forget that they are in my ear. Very comfortable and will not fall out. Sound quality is way better compared to the originals. Way more base and sound much better. Noise cancelation and transparency mode make such a big difference. Noise cancelation work amazing. Almost as good as the noise cancellation on the beats studio 3’s. And transparency mode is super convenient. Battery life is amazing. Only been charging them every 2-3 days. And it’s so nice to just drop them onto a wireless charger. Overall such an amazing upgrade. Highly highly recommend these if you like AirPods or looking into buying some AirPods. AirPods Pro is the way to go.', 'I love everything about these AirPods Pro. They have great sound and they are compact They charge wirelessly. I can’t recommend these enough. I mean they don’t have the best ip rating at 4 but that’s better than the galaxy buds and buds plus with a rating of 2.And they certainly don’t have the longest battery life. But I have galaxy buds+ as well if I need longer battery life. And they charge really fast. So it doesn’t really matter all that much.  Anyway I’m happy with them.', \"There's not much I can say that others have not. These are simply amazing headphones. The noise cancellation is simply sublime, especially considering it is being done by 2 tiny beans in your ears! The fit is perfect in  my ears, and it often feels like they aren't even there. The only gripe i have with them is that I find myself charging the case about every 1 week. This might not be bad, but I have some cheaper TWS earbuds that I only charge about every 2 weeks. That's it though. These are fantastic for sound quality, and all of the iOS features make them even better. Must buy!\", 'I have been searching for good headphones and I found incredible ones! After over a year of not being in the office, the noise cancelling function of these headphones is outstanding! Not to mention that you can pair them with multiple devices (two phones and a laptop) and switch back and forth between them seamlessly. I am incredibly impressed. The sound quality is spectacular for music and phone calls. Incredibly impressive!!!', \"This looks like an apple product and the sound is decent.  But I had issues when making calls.  People said they could not hear me well and I was cutting out.  So I called apple to see if they had any advice.  They asked for the serial number, and I gave it to them.  With the serial number they were able to determine this was not an apple product. It's hard to believe given they used apple packaging, but this is not an apple product.  I will be purchasing another set directly from apple this time.  Don't waste your time on this product just to save a few bucks, go to apple.\", 'Best ones I have had yet. Had the Bose, and the Klipsch, and a cheap and dirty generic brand but these are the bomb! The sound quality is as good and pairing is easy. Most in ear headphones fall out on me due to ear infections as a kid but these stay put! The noise cancellation is awesome. Kinda weird at first but very useful and you get used to it. If you’re looking for a good set of pods, look no further. Don’t waste your time or money on the others like I did. There worth the money.', 'Best ear buds I’ve ever used. I’ve used several different brands thinking the AirPods weren’t worth the price, but I was wrong. Extremely good sound quality for such a small package. You can truly hear the high and low end and not just the mid range like a lot of the other brands. The noise canceling is insanely good. A coworker was talking to me and I only noticed because I looked up and saw his mouth moving. The noise canceling is also great for people on the other end of the line if you use them while driving. No road noise or air conditioning hiss. Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Only warning is that many of the non Apple charging mats or stands are not compatible with these. Use the provided cable (USB C so you might need to get a new adapter which isn’t included) to charge them until the companies catch up. Spending $200 on a set of ear buds seems pretty crazy, but you’ll never go back.', 'Best gym headphones I\\'ve ever had. Great battery life.  Fits and STAYS in ear! The click to skip features are a thousand times then the regular airpod tap function. The noise cancelling is such a cool feature, especially once you turn transparent mode on. I\\'ve heard people complaining about the bass not being adequate. I\\'ll tell you this, if you want skull rattling bass, get big studio headphones. Not tiny in ear wirelessly buds. The \"sweat proof\" claim is kinda weird though... Like, was there a big issue with ear sweat that was plaguing the wireless headphone market?? Am I being insensitive to the apparently vast comunity of sweaty ear sufferers?? All in all, I have the regular pods and the pros. The pros are the way to go for sure', 'I literally hate these. They fall out of my ears constantly when running/working out. It doesn’t matter what size tip you put on them. The noise cancellation worked well in the early days but has gotten terrible over last several months. Not impressed for the price and the poor fit. I literally never leave reviews but after the 1000th time these things have fallen out of my ears I was done. As I work out in my basement at 10:45 at night I decided to pause and write this as a warning. Wait for the next iteration of AirPods. Apple, please do something about this. There are forums all over the Internet of people talking about how horrible of a fit these are for most peoples ears. Please find a solution. Thank you.', 'I have very sensitive hearing and hate noise. Music always sounds too loud and too may high pitch tones, until I got these. Wow! I love them. Can play music on my iPad and go upstairs or outside and they still work. Sounds so good. Plug and play, no set up for Apple users. Now I guess I’ll be upgrading my phone so they will work with that too. Very comfortable for someone who is very picky.', 'Love these headphones. They help cancel out the noise when I’m at the gym and even when riding a motorcycle which can be extra loud. I love the ability to turn the sound cancelling off so I can actually hear what’s around me too. Makes me feel a lot safer while walking around at night or in areas I don’t know. The microphone quality is already very nice. With other headphones, people said my voice sounded muffled but with these I haven’t had a problem.', 'Like every Apple Watch I have ever bought, these Airpod Pros are nothing special compared to the competition and are way WAY overpriced. Apple over-promises, under-delivers and over charges. I blame myself. It is hard to break the faith of a long time Apple fan such as myself but Apple has finally accomplished turning itself sour green. Leave it for the worms to devour.', 'Compared to the regular AirPods, these seem to lack bass but have more high pitch tones. The caps aren’t also all that great and I had to buy additional silicone covers to better fit my ears. The battery life also seems shorter. The noise cancellation is great and very useful, the stems are shorter and the pods easier to handle and put in as a result. I’d say probably not worth the full price but getting them at a substantial discount makes sense for the noise canceling features.', 'My biggest issues... 1) Needs more passive noise canceling, another words it needs to go in the ear further. Its hard to get a good fit, and I feel like I constantly have to keep trying to shove it in further. 2) Give the user more options on controls! Like a \"power boost\" mode that allows for higher volume but at lower battery life. I always have these on full volume, and it needs about 25-50% more! Also a simple equalizer would be nice to adjust to what you like. What I like the most... 1) It connects flawlessly to my iphone, every time! No cut outs, no static like other brands, it works well and is very reliable!! This is my main reason I stuck with these over other brands. 2) Voice on phone calls works really well. Bottom line, get these, its worth the price! I\\'m hoping for improvements though... maybe some ear attachments that are a bit longer, and maybe some better user controls for increasing volume, and button customization.', 'I purchased a these directly from the Apple store on Amazon and only lately have I noticed that I have to continuously reconnect my AirPods to my phone. It is quite annoying as sometimes it doesn’t always work and I have to try multiple times. However this is an issue I can take up with Apple Support. The product itself is extremely satisfactory and I am very happy with my purchase.', 'Honestly these are the bomb. If you really value music over anything and you own a iPhone device then this is definitely worth it. They sound amazing, but nothing to crazy, and the noise canceling does surprisingly well. If you don’t own an apple device or don’t plan on owning one then there’s obviously better options but the H1 chip in these provide seamless connection and from my old Bluetooth buds having to turn it on, wait five seconds for it to connect, than play music and to turn it off I have to hold down the power....I going off a tangent but you get the idea, using the pros is easy, sound great, and feel amazing. (P.S. if you’re worried if these will fall out easy or not used to silicone tips, I would invest in foam tips in my opinion, they feel and sound even better!)', \"I purchased these over the thanksgiving sale and already got them replaced twice. The connection breaks very often and it's such a pain to work with them. The sound quality is good but you can get the same from a lot of other available products in the market for a much cheaper price. Would not recommend these.\", \"right out of the box they worked great, just placed them near my phone and showed they had close to 1/2 a charge. sound was exceptional, I bought these because the ones I had previously got a slightly perceptible hum. the AirPods worked fine but after I paused the music to go into a store, I started music again and only one worked. the AirPods symbol didn't show upon when I placed the case near. I thought maybe they weren't charged enough so I put my phone on the charge and put the case near and nothing. I went to settings and even though the airpod showed as a bluetooth speaker along with my others when I pressed the circled I, it wasn't connected. I'm really disappointed and I need to go to ups store and need to wait for a replacement and anxious about whether $200 buys quality that lasts.\", 'After our heavy Sennheiser headset, with full surround, hard bass and crisp trebles, these air Pod Pro buds are brilliant. The headset gave me a neck and head ache. But these Air Pod Pro, are so light you forget they are there. The noise cancellation is superb, and yet the Full Bass and Bright highs are there too. They are an amazing technology and well crafted.', \"The noise canceling capabilities of the AirPods Pro really enhances the already excellent sound quality. I work out with these  and even when I'm drenched in sweat, they don't start to come loose in my ears. The interface with the iPhone is seamless. Once you open the case the phone detects the AirPods and gives you a popup screen with the battery life remaining for both the earpieces as well as the case. Nice. Over all a very nicely designed product and worth the expense.\", 'I didn’t think the sound quality or noise cancellation was satisfactory with these. My husband’s $40 Tozo earbuds do a better job of noise canceling. The sound quality for phone calls is better with my basic wired apple headphones. These hurt my ears even with the smallest size. I had them in for two hours and my ears hurt and I got a headache. Terrible product and way overpriced. Not for me.', 'The airpods are great but there’s a learning curve to using them.  The one for my right ear doesn’t fit great but I think it’s how my ear is and not necessarily the airpod itself because I’ve had this issue with similar products.  Love them when listening to a video or podcast and I’m on the move.  I wear a headband to help secure them when I’m out for a walk or run because I’m afraid of losing them 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ That’s just me.....I paid a lot of money for these.', \"I had a friend suggest I get a pair to help me with my hearing. I did so and read the description. When they arrived there was no way to charge them. I called Apple Tech support. The guy really was no help, he said I could buy and iPad or an Apple product and I could probably get them charged. I asked if there was anyway to charge them other than buying another Apple product, he said he didn't think so. So I returned the items since I didn't want to purchase an iPad.\", 'Not much to say, they’re great. If you’re an audiophile you will probably not be happy with any form of earbuds, they just don’t have the space for components that create the sound you want. But these are great. The price is high, but the functionality IS good. I have tried many cheap alternatives and while some may come close in terms of quality, they are gigantic or heavy or have poor battery life. If you can afford these, they are the best you can get. You won’t even feel them in your ears.', \"I don't understand the love for this product.  The battery life is mediocre and the sound quality isn't that much better than you'd find in earbuds half the price. The AirPods stay in my ear perhaps 99% of the time, but that's not good enough.  I can buy earbuds for $25 that stay in my ears 100% of the time. And to boot -- the noise cancellation feature just hurt my ears.\", \"Overall, it's quite a good product. The battery life is way better than my old AirPods 1st gen. But I don't particularly need the noise cancellation feature. It's also not that comfortable compared to normal AirPods. One main reason for me to buy this is because only the newer version AirPods (2nd gen and AirPods Pro) can seamlessly switch between iPhone, Macbook, and iPad.\", 'These were a gift for my husband. He had bought me a pair of AirPods a couple years ago and had occasionally made comments about maybe wanting some. (He has beats headphones) I got the AirPod pros for his birthday and he loves them! He uses them constantly and says the sound quality is great. The beats will probably still be his gym headphones but definitely gets more daily use out of the AirPods.', 'The pair I bought from Amazon was used-mint when in fact I paid for brand new. They were a pair of the older recalled models that Apple has been exchanging for people. The original owner must have noticed the issues and returned them because there are obvious audio issues. The sound quality for music is great but it can be staticky or distorted. At certain times one or the other will not detect being in my ear and just shut off cutting out the audio until I readjust it. Furthermore since Amazon sold me a previously owned product, the original owner’s Apple ID was still connected to it. Therefore I could not link mine. So if I lost any part of them I would be out of luck for the location feature. Why Amazon did not ensure that it was disconnected from the previous owners ID, I do not know. I’m returning for a full refund and buying another pair labeled brand new. Let’s see if Amazon gets it right this time.', 'The new Spacial Audio Feature brings out the bass in the music. It has all the other parts of the song playing in different places around you but the bass has this filling sound to it as if it is completely filling the area around you. The bass is GREAT with Spacial audio enabled and bass boost in your Music settings Better than the Studio Beats Pro 3 sound cancellation. In the end it is the easiest thing to use and take care of. Just remember to buy a cheap case to keep scratches off the nice white one :)', 'I’m not kidding when I say this. I was walking to my morning class and we have train tracks next too our housing so typical me had my airpods in and walked out to like a normal day. So I was halfway in between the rails when I looked to my right and there was a train less than 10 yards from me going full speed that I had not even heard until it blared its horn AFTER I saw it. I almost shit my pants and pissed myself and I have never backed up out of the way faster in my entire life. To make a long story short the noise cancellation on these headphones is so great I almost got hit by a train. I would highly recommend these headphones unless you work in the railroad industry. 10/10', 'I bought these specifically for a dental appointment, so I can drown out the noises. I can’t believe HOW much noise really get cancelled out! I was a little hesitant because of the little plastic pieces on the ends. But I like that they come with different sizes. Comes with what I believe is size medium, I switched to small & it’s so comfortable. Will be purchasing a second pair for my husband!', 'These are incredible. I was a little hesitant but then a friend recommended them to me and I have no regrets. Plus buying them through amazon gets you $50 off. -The sound quality is incredible -the noise cancellation is awesome -the transparency mode blows my mind I can hear everybody talking perfectly as well as my music playing. -I love that when you take one of them out your music stops -the charging case is so convenient. -Siri reads your texts.', \"These are def an upgrade over the regular AirPods.  Only con I have is the ear bud covers and trying to find the correct fit.  Tried all 3 sizes, the mid size works best for me but not ideal. I even tried purchasing new ear tips, found a pair that work better from a fit standpoint but then the noise cancellation feature didn't work as well as the OEM ear tips.  It's not huge turn off and I'm def happy to have these over the regular AidPods...sounds quality is great, the noise cancellation feature works well too.  I'll keep looking for some new ear tips though!\", 'I had all the previous versions, they all work well.  I wanted noise cancelation for while mowing the lawn, so-so for that, better than nothing.  I will use other ones I bought that covers the ear as those work exceptional and can listen to phone and talk on them.  But these are good for lying down, better bluetooth connection, and can tell better than past generation.  Noise cancelation is not bad, just not enough for loud equipment, maybe to drown out partner snoring.', 'I purchased the Sony WH100xm3 and these AirPods pro and compared them . I kept the AirPods pro. These aipods had a hissing sound when I play them out of the box, this later went away. The noise cancelation is not as great as Sony and Bose the cancelation is different and less powerful. But it is good and will block mist sound , the Sony tare also bulkier and huge on your head and they don’t fit in your pocket and come with a charging case and Apple ecosystem. The bass is still weak and sound similar close to regular AirPods but you can adjust it but still the s I be is better in the Sony but the portability in that small sound difference is still worth it in my book just look at how small they are. I like the controls in the ear it makes it easier than stopping your music by grabbing your phone or watch, Sony also has this feature but it’s only in one ear and you have to use your whole hand to change or pause I didn’t think that was as cool as the AirPods. These AirPods did make my ear hurt as they are heavier than regular pods the Sony and Bose make your ears hurt and sweaty.', 'Saw this product on sale I decided to get it of course only for the noise cancellation which works impeccable I also bought this product because I didn’t lose my EarPods and I didn’t want to rebuy the normal ones so I bought these of course it’s perfect sound quality Even though you have noise cancellation you could still hear a bit of the outside sound well it’s not too bad', 'I was very disappointed when they kept falling out of my ears. This is a problem with these AirPod Pro and the tips they provide. One fell out went down the decorative airduct in the floor. I had to get down on hands & knees and pull the grate out of the floor. I stuck my hand in and had to feel around years of stuff, but found it. Get the foam tips and they will stay in your ears.  This was poorly designed by Apple. After the fix, they work well with all my phone, computer and TV.', 'I was very excited to get these and they worked perfectly for the first few weeks. Then the left one stopped charging all the time. It would say they were both charging when I put them in the case and walked away but in the morning, one is 100% the other is still at 10%. So I have to sit there and manually fiddle with it until I can get it to charge (and yes, I confirmed the case was clean like apple said to). Annoying, but could deal with. The real issue is a few weeks after that, they started having issues connecting to iPhone 11 and MacBook pro on Catalina. Would factory reset: nothing. Reset again: nothing. Often took 3-5 resets to get them to start pairing until they finally worked. Since this multi-reset process would take up to 15 minutes, this made them unusable some of the time. The final straw is when one ear will consistently connect but the other will not to MacBook Catalina. Will often take dozens of resets to sometimes get to work, but still often not. It makes them totally unusable. For how much money these cost, I expect much better quality. Extremely disappointed and will be attempting to get a refund from apple.', 'I love these better than the first generation. I love how small they look while I’m wearing them. I also use the small ear tips so they fit better. The noise cancellation makes me think I can’t hear anything, so it really blocks out and minimizes any outside noise. Battery life is great. I don’t use them all day and I give them a break when I’m at home and I alternate use between these and the regular plugged in earphones. They also connect instantly when your Bluetooth is on. I recommend.', 'I bought the Pro version of the Airpods because the regular ones wold not fit securely in my ear.  I had to buy attachments that would have to be taken on and off every time I wanted to wear the Airpods.  After dealing with that for 16 months, I just wanted a pair of wireless headphones that I cold put on and take off without a minute or two of fumbling with aftermarket covers.  These Airpods fit great high tout of the box.  The noise cancelling works really well (I can barely hear my children!).  I would highly recommend anyone that had trouble wearing the original Airpods give these a try.', \"Some reviews say these were not real Apple products, but cheap junk. The ones I got had the serial number printed on the box. I entered that number into Apple's site, and sure enough it came up with these Airpods. My wife loves them. Raves about the clarity of sound and when talking on the phone, I can't tell that she is using them. She is very happy with them so far. I deducted one start since Apple doesn't provide the charger wall plug with them. For $250, they should provide everything you need to use the products. Low class on Apple's part.\", 'Sound quality is good, better than most competitors like TZO’s or Jabras, however, it lacks in fitting, at least for me (the tips of all sizes still slip out if I move too much). Noise cancellation is good too but compared to Bose Quiet Comfort, it’s like comparing DisneyLand with Joe’s Crab Shack. And Bose quiet comfort is only about $100 more, I bought the AirPods to compare and make this review. (Have had Bose for 1 1/2 years now, still going strong). AirPods do have better battery life per charge, but the actual case battery isn’t that good.', 'AirPods were great when they first came out, and then became one of top brands for \"wireless earphones\". AirPods Pro are beyond what I expected. Noise cancellatiion and transparency mode are perfect. And adding the soft rubber tips make it fit perfectly inside my ear, whereas the original airpods always fell out. These are so comfortable that I forget they are in my ear. Using the touch sensors to pause music is phenomenal. And if you are on the edge about getting these, go ahead and get it. You won\\'t regret it at all. All that i think they could improve is tjhe price. Now, it is apple so your kinda stuck.', 'since there are fake airpros out there, just in case you were wondering. 5 hours battery life, max, be aware.  The sound quality is inferior headphones, naturally but again you be aware.  There is a ton of functionality in these that took me some sit-down to learn.', 'Wow.. Calidad de sonido 5/5 Cancelación de sonido externo 5/5 Mega feliz con mi Airpod Pro Excelente volumen tanto para música, videos o película. En pocas palabras vas a disfrutar al 100% el valor que tienen estos audífonos. A por cierto no son falsificados como alguien dijo en un comentario. Son 100% originales de apple ya lo comfirme por unos codigos que tiene la caja afuera. Escanealos con tú celular y te mandara a Apple so si son Originales. Rápido envio. Thanks Apple and Amazon😉', 'These were not as easy to connect to Bluetooth as described, it took quite awhile for my phone to finally recognize them and connect to my phone,  and when I finally did get them connected they show up on my Bluetooth list as a bunch of Chinese letters as the name of them,  which leads me to believe these may not be authentic.', 'Where to begin- I consider myself an audio (and fitness)-phile since I work out and jog/run almost on a daily basis so of course, having a good pair of Bluetooth earbuds are essential to me. I’m thrilled apple released this so I’m going to state the pros and cons: Pros: the noise cancellation DOES work. I was shocked and of course it may not block out loud traffic outdoors etc. (in my case) but I was able to test them indoors and I was impressed how well it blocked out most noises. I haven’t tested in the planes or during travel however. Also, the charge time is super quick, they fit comfortably (with ear gels), and they do NOT fall off when running. The case is compact and I just like the size of the earbuds. Never had an issue with Bluetooth pairing or connectivity (so far). Charge time is quick however, which leads me to my next complaint (please see below)... Cons: for the insane price point, I would expect much better battery life. The battery life is trash. I owned a pair of Skullcandy earbuds that had much better battery life and were 1/3 of the price. I’d assume that one would have to charge these on a daily basis in order to use them everyday (for me may be every other day), which to me doesn’t seem all that practical. Another slight irritation or annoyance is that in order to turn the volume up or down, you have to “ask” Siri to do so. I don’t ever use Siri on my phone so this was a slight inconvenience to have to rely on her for something so simple when it could be done via touch or tap. But I’ve also never had any problems with Siri when adjusting the volume so I suppose these earbuds work the way they should.', 'Finally! I ordered wireless headphones three different times and had to send them all back. They just didn’t have that sound quality  I was looking for. Especially since I been using the studio beats for so long. I just didn’t want to spend a lot money this time. Even one of them were the solo beats which was surprisingly low. But my AirPods Pro came 30min I was testing them out so far exactly what I was listening for. The sound is GREAT! Loudness, Bass, Noise Cancellation, & Clarity what more can I ask for.', \"I like the quality of sound but they are always getting tangled in my hair or simply falling out of my ears no matter what shape ear form I use. I was not able to easily change from the earbuds to these. I was also hanging up on people when trying to adjust them to hear better on a telephone call. It's too bad Apple has not invested in earbuds that are comfortable with the wire. I love the Roku designed inner earpiece for comfort or the Bose brand with the inner ear wedge to keep them in place.\", 'I truly love my AirPods for many reasons, including the noise cancellation and ease of use. But the body of the AirPod pros is just way too big for my ears. The slip and sit comfortably into my ears but then start feeling painful after a short amount of time...to the point where I have to take breaks in between wearing them. I have tried the different ear piece sizes but those don’t make a difference as I stated that it’s the AirPod Body itself that’s too big. It’s pushing hard against my ears', 'You have to experience this for yourself words cannot explain how awesome this tech is the noise cancellation Yes unbelievable I thought I was going deaf but the noise cancellation cancels out all noise oh the noise if you want a good tech this is the product for you remember you pay for what you get and when you get this text is worth every single penny you spend on it trust me you will not be disappointed.', 'We all know how seamless Apple is with the software integration of their products. This isn\\'t even worth mentioning. If you want something that \"just works\" and money isn\\'t an issue, get these. However I was unlucky enough to be one of the few whose ears just don\\'t agree with the airpod shape. Which is a shame. They caused my ears quite the amount of pain after only half an hour of listening so I had to return them.', 'When I first got these, I was elated to finally have a pair of great True Wireless Earbuds. I mean, they were $220 at the time, and so many good reviews, it had to be good. And yeah, it was good, at first. Everything worked fine, until about 1 week in. Then, the noise cancelling started to turn on and off. It was very rare at first, and would only last for a few seconds, so I put it off. About a month of use later, it got a little worse. Still, I didn\\'t believe it warranted a contact to apple support. But today, it got to the point where I HAD to contact support. I did, and they told me that they could service them for \"free\", as Apple started a service program for Airpod Pros with \\'Sound Issues\\'. But it wasn\\'t free, and actually $197.50. That money was an \"Authorization hold\", which I didn\\'t even have. Luckily I contacted Amazon support, and the person I talked to was able to get me a replacement Update: Same thing happened again. Never buying Apple again. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else. International Version (No Seller Warranty) of the Sony WH1000XM3 is $230, if I recall correctly.', 'Great sound quality. Took a few weeks of wearing them for them to not hurt my ears anymore. I usually wear them for about 4-5 hours until they die. However, it’s been 5 months since I’ve purchased these and the right one is dying significantly faster than the left. Like I take it out of the charging case and the right one immediately starts going down in battery life. Really bummed because I saved up for these.', \"I caught the deal where they were $15 off. Good deal! Shipping took exactly 13 days from when I ordered them to when I greedily tore open the package to get my hands on these. I love them, they are very comfortable, the noise cancelling is unexpectedly amazing and I have not run into any issues with battery life. I can't compare these to the older generation Airpods because these are my first pair but man, they check every single box for me.\", \"These sound great for listening to music and the noise cancellation is pretty good for earbuds. But the main reason I bought these was for making phone calls. For making calls these things are TERRIBLE! When on a call the person on the other end will always complain that they cannot hear you clearly and that you sound distant. This is a common issue and is well documented on the Apple support pages. I have a replacement pair on the way, but from what I have read, this is an issue for all Pro's. If this second pair fixes the issue I will update this review, but to be honest I am not very hopeful and will probably have to return the second pair for a refund. So, if you just want listen music and have noise cancelling ability these are for you. If you are looking to make any phone calls with these, don't bother and look for something else.\", 'The sound quality is amazing. I love the noise cancellation, and I also like that I can adjust it if I need to. I video chat several hours a day and I only have to charge the case every few days. These feel so much better and fit better in the ears than the first AirPods.', 'These sound quite good and are excellent about pairing with whichever Apple device I’m using. They switch seamlessly between my phone, iPad and MacBook. These are the first pair of wireless earphones I’ve owned that do so. The bad part is that I can’t get them to stay in my ears. They seem to fall out anytime I’m exercising or even just moving around. They haven’t gotten lost or broken test when they fall to the ground but they fall out often enough that I suspect that’s how they will meet their eventual demise.', 'The sound quality was wonderful. However the first pair was defective in that the right earbud would discharge on its own even in the charger, often to zero voltage. I returned it for another set and that was even more damaged. Only one earbud would work at a time, never both. Then It would get static and cut out. Even when a single earbud was working the sound was awful. And these were both clearly defective and I would not even try to purchase it again. Hope you have better luck than I did.', 'The fit takes some getting used to (as they go in your ear canal vs the regular airpods that just sit in your ear), but once you get used to that, these are pretty amazing. The noise cancellation is unreal (honestly, it’s a game changer) and the sound quality is MUCH improved over the regular airpods. If you have the means, I’d chose the airpod pro over airpods for sure', 'Absolute trash!!! Bought on May 15th.. My right ear bud has already stopped working!! I disconnected them from my phone thinking that would help.. Well now I cant even get the left ear bud to reconnect!!', 'These are the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE devices ever. As I type, my right ear and entire right side of my face is in pain. With the Corona pandemic, I can’t see how I am going to have these returned. I suspect I may need to visit an ENT! I don’t know if I’m an anomaly or if these reviews are hidden. I searched extensively before purchasing and only WISH I had seen a review like this to guide me. DO NOT BUY! Let me add, the noise cancellation feature is amazing. I bought it for this feature based on my work. So disappointed! In soooo much pain. Can’t explain anymore.', 'The price made me hesitant about buying these, but I work in a noisy office and my upstairs neighbors have a two year old. I needed some peace. The sound cancellation isn’t 100%, but it’s surprising good at providing relief in both situations. In addition, at home, I can listen to music or watch movies without worrying that I’m the one who’s disturbing others. They’re an investment, so I have a rule that they’re either in my ears or safely stored in the case. They’re not going to mysteriously disappear at work or be eaten by my dog at home.', 'One of the big functions I was looking for in this item was to use it with my iPhone, really no better than a cheaper $30 earphone. I had problems getting a refund for the service warranty that was $30. Other people had also complained here. I called Amazon using an app on my phone, talked to a really great service person in Mississippi--got an instant refund! I called and left word to return my call and the minute I hung up they called back right away.', 'Okay, at first I fussed and fussed about the price tag. I like Apple products but the prices...smh. Other ear buds were good at first and then went bad pretty quick. Pairing poorly and sound not too great. I broke down and paid the price for these.  Now, I freaking love these things. The noise cancellation is on point and the sound quality is great. I also love the ease in pairing and the pause-pickup when taking in and out of ear. I can use one, then the other if I need them for a long timespan. You got me good.', \"The best $300 I've spent! Sound is crisp and clear. The one con I'll give it is that it slips out of my ear as I am running. That could be that I need to change the size of the ear bud. Overall, this is a great technology. With the noice cancellation, It blocks out everything and I am on cloud nine enjoy my music. The mic is also very clear. In fact much clearer than when I use my iPhone 11's speaker. People hear me better and clearer when I use this item. Highly recommended!!\", 'These work really well.  It was important for me to be able to \"hear through\" the earpiece (regular AirPods don\\'t have that feature).  Noise blocking is effective, and of course music and phone sounds great.  Wish the battery lasted longer though.', \"I dislike they way they fall out and I am not moving around that much.  Apple knows better than to release a defective product to it's followers.  This is insulting.  It's evidently a good tech product but it doesn't stay in the ear and to make us purchase another item to make it work is awful and says the company is suffering in its integrity on some level.  Generally this comes from management down to it seller.\", 'I was hesitant at first to spend the money because I had no way of knowing I’d the noise cancelling feature was that good but I’m sold!  These block ambient noise even with nothing playing. It takes a bit to adjust to at first but it’s amazing. Blocks office conversations, car noise, the hubby’s tv cranked to wow, you name it. Very pleased with how long the battery charge lasts for the earbuds and the case. I can go days without using them and they are still ready to go when I need them. Fast charging on both too. Very much worth the price!', 'I wish I could say I love them but they kept falling out of my ears when I would house clean. The noise cancellation and sound quality is so nice that I don’t even hear the vacuum running when I clean however it was really annoying when it kept falling out of my ears. 251$ for earphones to fall out was not worth it. I’m sad to say that I had to return them because of my small ears. I wish Apple made these for small ears. The regular was better.', \"Had no idea apple could pull out so many stops with the noise cancellation. honestly, night and day difference when it's activated or not. I have Bose QCII's as well, and they kinda compress my eardrum with their noise cancellation. these dont do that at all, and are much more discreet. im no audiophile tho, and find the sound quality on these more than adequate for my needs of primarily podcasts and audiobooks. the music is def nice as well, but not really my forte.\", \"Great sound quality and fantastic noise cancellation. The Bluetooth range is great too - I've been able to leave my phone in my house, walk out a (metal) door, around a building to take out the trash with minimal interference. If you lose an airpod in your apartment, however, don't expect the Find My feature to work. Allegedly, it will have your airpod make a sound. This is moot because it will only work if connected via Bluetooth, and it will only connect if the airpod is on, and your airpod only turns on when in your ear. Extremely frustrating when this happens. Apple should not even advertise this.\", \"These are great wireless headphones.  I have Powerbeats by Dre and the AirPods Pro sound quality is really close to it (the really low end isn't quite there).  I definitely use them more than I expected I would (intended for just running as the Powerbeats wire kept pulling earpiece out of a snug fit while running). Two annoyances - but not enough to make me hate them or return them: no volume control from the earpiece itself (just pause/skip and noise cancellation settings), which I knew before buying.  And, if you are laying on your back, the AirPods Pro could fall out - but only if you are moving around or its hot or your ears are super waxy as gravity is pulling in the one direction they don't have great support.\", 'First time going with wireless ear pods as my current iPhone does not have an earphone jack.  AirPods work seamlessly with my cell phone, lap top and smartwatch which is nice.  Most of my music listening in the car does not require AirPods, so I bought these for the few occasions when I need to listen quietly (eg, airplane) and/or enjoy the noise cancellation feature.', 'Works better than expected, but regardless still hard to justify $250. Definitely could get better sound from competitors at even half the price, but having multiple iOS devices makes this item worth seriously considering. The seamless connection with iOS makes it very appealing being an iPhone/Apple Watch user, but as before mentioned, you’re compromising potentially better sound at a cheaper price for convenience for considerably more money.', 'The noise cancellation affects not just the sound going into your ears but what the microphone “hears” as well. The ears parts works pretty well, and if that was all I needed I would have given 4’s and 5’s However I also need the microphone to work, and here is where I run into trouble. It doesn’t. Every so often it decides the signal (my voice) is noise and needs to dialed down. People on the other end of the call report intermittent poor sound quality and low volume. Never has that with the basic AirPods. There are reams of web pages describing this problem and no acknowledgement by Apple that I could find. Turning Bluetooth off and on may have helped, not sure yet. Re-pairing did not. Apple demands premium prices but usually delivers premium quality. This seems like an experiment in keeping prices high while delivering poor engineering. I hope they get the message that this is not the way to win over customers.', 'Brand new product straight out of the box plugged in overnight. Next morning case charges 100% but AirPods only 46%. After that uneven charging for next hour where one was at 95% amd the other at 53%. None of the tips fit snug. The sounds keeps coming on and off as rips are adjusted in the ear. Could not tell the difference between off mode abs transparent mode. No app to control anything. Confusing to figure out settings through the Bluetooth connection. The overall experience is definitely not worth the high price.', 'I am a huge fan of Apple, but I was not happy with the purchase. The extension looks a bit weird. I have added the pros and cons below. Maybe for other people it will be a perfect fit. Pros: 1. Amazing call quality 2. good battery life 3. Bluetooth connection was amazing Cons: 1. switching between devices is painful 2. I expected better sound quality 3. Fit; did not fit in ears perfectly After using for few days, I decided to return it as it was not up to my expectation. Thanks to Amazon’s amazing return policy.', 'Listen, we all know that Apple is awesome, they are the best, nothing compares. These headphones however are somewhat difficult because there is a hang up button on them that is extremely sensitive so when you gently touch it it hangs up on people meaning if the AirPod needs to be adjusted you likely will hang up on the person you’re speaking with, it’s extremely frustrating, but other than that they’re awesome!', \"I am connecting these to an iPhone 7. Not sure if these work better with later models. These earphones are super buggy - often people can't hear me when I answer calls - however when I pull them off my ear to answer calls - the calls still keep switching between them and the iphone which is super annoying. The older model just worked - this one I am only keeping because the noise cancellation is good and I travel by bus for my commute. I hate everything else about them including the staying inside the ear - they fall off every few minutes so I have to keep adjusting them\", \"I regret not returning these in time.  I love my original airpods, although their battery life seems to be getting shorter and shorter.  These new noise canceling airpods have lots of issues.  First, the ear pieces are uncomfortable.  I've tried small, medium and large and they all are uncomfortable.  Second, because they don't fit well, they fall out.  unlike my original airpods, which fit nicely, these will fall out when I walk.  Lastly, they don't seem to connect well to my iPhone, and will quickly disconnect - especially when i touch them (which I do often since they fall out!).  I mainly use my old airpods and wish I could trade in the airpods pro for another set of the originals\", 'I bought these for my wife for her birthday and she could not be happier with them. She had been using a cheap, crappy brand and was perfectly happy with those, but as soon as she put these in and started her music she was like \"OMG!\" I also tried them out and could not believe the richness of sound coming from them. Miles above the other brand. They\\'re pricey, yes, but it\\'s Apple. With them comes Apple quality and it\\'s worth it!', \"I've had this AirPods Pro for a while now. It is a great product. But I will say that because of the recent update apple has RUINED the noise cancellation. It does not block low frequency sound like is used to be since the recent update and apple needs to fix this. The sound quality is acceptable, slightly more bass than the regular AirPods but don't expect audiophile quality. Battery life is as expected, with about 4.5 hours with ANC on. This is a good product, but until apple fixes the ANC I will hold back my recommendation.\", 'La calidad de productos apple y la estética de los mismos es insuperable, buena calidad de sonido y de cancelación de ruido, pero me hubiera gustado poder administrar otras funciones desde los earbuds  como subir y bajar el volumen o adelantar y retroceder sin tener que hacerlo desde mi iPhone.', 'I have had these for a few months now and i regret spending the amount of money these are priced it for the quality. I have always used LG Tone ultras for years and wish i bought me a new pair of Tobe ultras over these. They never connect easily to my android and are always really buggy where there are times they will go ibto isolation mode but not reverae back to allowing the sound of your surroundings in. The battery life sucks sometimes i get 2 hours of life out of them and have to charge again. For only having them for a couple months this is horrible. Also the hurt my ears, the length of the inner ear rubbers are not long enough to reach the depth of them staying in my ears with out backing themselves out unless i push them to where the hard plastic housing is pressing into my outer ear. After a hour i have pain where they are pressing. So disappointed i spent so much for this product. I highly recommend against buying this product. Quality and price just dont add up.', \"They slipped out of my ear from sweating while doing work around the house.  That's a bit disappointing.  For an in-ear product they are very nice but expensive.  I engaged the noise canceling option but people tell me it does a poor job.  I knew I could control the volume only from my iPhone but hopefully Apple will find a way around that on future versions.  I also have an over-the-ear Plantronics with controls on the unit itself and it's only about $70.00 with GREAT noise canceling and a mute button.\", 'We got em last Sunday. I hear a noise on the right AirPod. Like you are smashing plastic paper. With my preciosas AirPods I was able to displace to a pretty good distance from the phone, not with this one. I was so used to move around my house with the aiprods not with this one. What it bother me the most is the fact that the case charger is fully charged and so the AirPod, 100% full and the battery runs fast. Today I got em at 9am am I went to a meeting for 1.5 hour. I put em in the charger that is fully charged. By 215pm it has 15% battery. I spoke over the phone for a full hour counting or adding all the calls, I’m very disappointed that I have to charge em every 3 hours. I’m wondering if I can send em back.', 'The AirPods Pro are the top of the line AirPods from Apple in my opinion. The noise canceling works great, blocks out everything around you except for the music or Podcasts you were listening to which makes it very immersive. New software features give the AirPods Pro more bang for your buck. The spatial audio is amazing, and now they added a head tracking feature. When you move your head it sounds as if whatever you’re listening to is always in front of you. Highly recommend the AirPods Pro, only bad side is the battery life. The AirPods Pro only last about 4 1/2 hours of playtime but you can put them back in the case for about 10 minutes and have another hour of listening.', 'Very difficult to stop in the ear and the noise cancelation is not as good as that of bose in addition to stop working from time to time without any explanation. Another negative factor is that in this new generation they removed the sensitive touch and have to press it hard with two fingers which makes it difficult to do what they want to do besides leaving the ear all the time. It really is a bad product.', 'I received the the shipment quickly.  I was excited to try these as I have been struggling with trying to find a good set  of wireless earbuds for working out.  I run so I was concerned that they would not stay in place.  If I wear these out or around the house they are great.  However when I wear them on a run they loosen, which impacts sound quality and I am afraid that I will lose one.  I am continuously pressing them back into place.  I have swapped the tips from the smaller to the medium size to try and get a better fit.  I even used the mobile app tool for ensuring that you are using the right tips. Overall I would recommend these for anyone who just wants wireless earbuds for everything but vigorous workouts.', 'The sound quality for music is awesome. You can also get that out of a pair of mifo ones (which I have ) for a fraction of the price. Main reason I bought these was for call quality and it’s just not there people complain about background noise on calls with me which is really frustrating. The batter life on them is trash 4 hours or less mifos get 8 per pod and the case has over 100 hrs of charge time on it. Overall wish I would have saved the 170 and just kept my mifos', 'Don’t be thinking this is apple therefore everything is just great.  Owned for a year and a half and two big issues.  Number one, the right bud is dead.  No sound.  Second, regardless of rubber earpiece, I can’t get these things to stay in my ear, even during a walk.  Always adjusting, a lot of times, picking off the ground.  Better to look for a better quality, better designed earbud set.', 'I researched many Bluetooth earbud headphones and settled on the AirPod Pro’s. The AirPods connect very easily with my iPhone, MacBook, and even my work PC. The sound quality is superb considering how small they are, and I really like the different “noise” modes. The battery has not been a major issue - I predict they would last 3 to 4 hrs of constant usage (ie. watching a movie). My only concern was with the comfort of the earbuds since they hurt my ears when I initially wore them. However, my ears got used to them after a few days of normal usage. Currently, I barely notice that I have them on. I would definitely recommend these if noise cancelling is a desired feature, among the other normal features of AirPods.', 'I like them a lot but they won’t stay in my ears. I’ve tried the three provided tip sizes and that didn’t help at all. I had to purchase a modified ear tip to keep them securely in my ears! Other family members had no problems with them- go figure. For me they kept loosening and eventually falling right out of my ears. This is a design problem that Apple must correct, luckily there is a workAround.', 'It took me a while before I spent the extra cash on these ear buds, but the price difference is so great. I’ve bought 4 different brands from $20-50 each none of which were great and each had its own issue: sound quality, battery life, or connectivity. I’ve had none of those issues with the earbud pro’s and the noise cancellation is a bonus. They work with ease and automatically connect. I highly recommend spending the money upfront- I would have saved $200 not being so cheap.', \"Many will complain saying that the airpods pro are not good, and will start counting the cons instead the pros, however today got mine and after testing it, I highly recommend the airpods pro, I loved them. I already used them since December and been great, my complain is thar after the latest firmware update, the noice cancellation is not being so effective as the first firmware and is something that we can't avoid it updates automatically\", \"I've read about some people having problems with AirPods falling out. Maybe the default rubber earpiece is just my size, but I've had no such problem. I'm still working out everything I can do with them (iPhone, Mac, etc.), but I'm happy. The only problem I had was figuring out how to get them out of the charging case, but a little online research gave me the trick.\", 'I never owned AirPods before buying these AirPods Pro. I am very active in fitness and have used the Beats Powerbeats for over 5 years. I was in the market for ear buds, not for just the gym, but also for use at my desk to listen to podcasts and music. Wasn\\'t looking for any spectacular sound quality, but wanted the convenience of the typical Apple EarPods, but without the wires and also the ability to use for phone calls, seamless Bluetooth connection with my iPhone, and decent to good battery life. I can say these AirPods Pro check all the boxes. The only critique I have is the inability to adjust the volume (unless using my iPhone to do so). I miss the feature on my Powerbeats to have something to \"click\" to adjust the volume. This is mostly an inconvenience at the gym, but not a big deal at my desk when my phone is nearby. I haven\\'t used the noise cancellation features much in public, but can attest they are effective. I got these on Prime Day on sale for $199 (and then used other Amazon points to get them at around $175). I know the retail price of $250 is steep, but I probably would have bought them at that price eventually if necessary. As long as I get a good 3-4 years out of them I will be satisfied.', 'These airpods are incredible. The sound quality is crisp and clear and the noise cancelling is exceptional. I recently took them on a trip and was amazed at how they cancel the ambient noise to create an environment in which I could just focus on my movie or music. The ability to quickly turn on/off the noise cancellation is fantastic as well. When listening to music, you can remove the airpods and the music will pause, then when placing them back in your ears the music will resume - perfect for quick conversations with people. The battery life is sufficient for the purposes of my use. I made it about a 4+ hour flight before having to dock them in the case for a quick recharge - but that is it - a very quick recharge. In all, Apple outdid themselves with these airpods. 10/10 would recommend!', \"They seamlessly connected to my iPhone (11 Pro) right out of the box. I like how they fit, don't fall out, sound great, have noise-cancellation, and are water-resistant. Great for workouts or being in the rain. You can easily switch from noise-cancellation to transparent mode so others can hear you (without having to take one out of your ear). They are a bit pricey, but worth it at $234. Plus, you can add Apple Care for $29 (for two years of coverage). I normally use my Bose QC-35 Series II's but these are a great alternative for “in ear” portability. If they  came in black that would be ultimate.\", \"Long story, short... I wasn't that excited to get these. It just wasn't at the top of the list of things I wanted to buy. I saw that everyone had them and assumed it was just a trend because it's an Apple product. I bought them because one night I was running and my head phones with the cord kept tangling and falling out. I had enough. So, I bought them. I absolutely don't regret it. I personally believe the hype is worth it. I'm a runner and enjoy doing HIIT workouts. I was worried they wouldn't stay in. They stay in about 95% of the time when I'm running and about 85-90% of the time when I'm doing HIIT (for the most part, they stay in when I'm doing burpees). To me, that's impressive. I am including those percentages with sweat as well. I am a sweater and they have maintained. They are sweat resistant and I have been putting that to the test. It is simple when you're running to switch to noise cancellation or the transparency mode. I thin the sound quality is pretty high too. I'm someone who likes to tune out when they're running and I feel it lets me do that. So, as a runner, I would recommend these if you want to ditch the cord. I really have not had any issue with them. Overall, I've used them just past running. I use them with my laptop (which is not Apple but a Dell) and they work well. I also really, really enjoy using them to multitask with things around the house and talk/listen to something else. . Con: you'll want to invest in Qtips (you should probably have these already) to keep them clean. It does get gross when you pull them out of your ear and there is hair or earwax on it.\", 'When you put them in the case to charge they don’t always charge And the case Is Fully Charged', \"They are a clear upgrade from the original design but the noise cancelling isn't great. You can hear it kick in but i can have it on and the volume up but can still hear the weights clanging in the gym and I can barely hear them over my motorcycle with  a full face helmet and a head wrap. I used to wear $40 wired headphones bought off of Amazon that did better in that category. I still like the comfort and the sound up to 75% max volume but they get tinney after that. The moister wicking is still great and as expected they work seamlessly with my IPhone and Apple Watch.  Also they stay put when I run. I was worried that was going to be a problem, but isn't.\", \"These are really good. Sound quality is pretty good, noise cancelling is phenomenal, design is clean, size is good. Battery life is too short imo. Unfortunately no matter what I tried, these hurt the top of my ears. I've swapped different sized eartips, used aftermarket tips, and added memory foam. Nothing removes the pain.\", 'They come with a charging cable, but no wall plug adapter.  I have tried 2 different Apple wall outlet adapters. Although the charging cable fits, they don’t charge the AirPods. You can only charge the AirPods by plugging the cable into your computer or using a wireless adapter.  Apple literally could not make it more difficult to charge these AirPods.  I’m sending them back.', 'Simply get them!! I promise they will over deliver in every aspect of your decisions to purchase!! I wish I would have pulled the trigger earlier after using. Excellent sound quality and I have spent lots of money on UltimateEars earbuds in the past. These aren’t as good but close! Checks the box for sound quality and listening to music.  Functionality with Siri and noise cancellation is remarkable, nothing like it. I was worried about these falling out of my ears bc the wired earbuds that came with my iPhone both hurt my ears over long use and they are not secure at all. These AirPod Pros aren’t going anywhere, locked in! Just get them.', 'I preordered them before they came out and it was a great decision. This is an amazing product right here. The customizable fit, the noise cancellation, transparency mode, a shorter stem, a fast charging case, and overall a wonderful invention. The only criticism I have is the battery life isn’t longer than the gen 2s. It is either the same, or shorter when in transparency mode. Also, it is great to buy it now because it is 14 dollars off. I don’t recommend getting it from amazon because when it arrived (it took 9 days) the package was damaged and there was nothing protecting the AirPods.', \"The auto pause is horrible.  When both buds are in ear and one is removed, it will pause - which is great.  But then it will immediately start playing again and then pause again, sometimes 3 or 4 times.  When the bud is put back in the ear it will sometimes play, sometimes not.  The pause button on the actual airpod works sometimes, but often requires pressing play on the phone.  This inconsistency of function is horribly annoying.  I handle a lot of incoming calls for work so I need headphones that will reliably pause when I answer the phone and not start playing again while I'm trying to talk to a customer.  If they functioned correctly they would be great.  The noise cancellation and transparency functions are both great.\", 'I’ve never been a fan of in-ear buds but these made me change my mind. Great sound quality. Love how I can interact with what I’m listening to without needed my phone in hand. Honestly, these did hurt my ears at first, as I hadn’t used any sort of ear buds In a long time. Counterintuitively, the large size hurt my ears less and they don’t hurt at all now that I’ve gotten used to them.', \"Def will not buy again.  These airpod's broke in about 18 months.  I am now out $250.  Something like this just shouldn't break that quickly.  They were great for a bout 6 months.  Then, slowly, the Bluetooth would start to get sketchy, sometimes the pods would start turning into static, building and swelling until all you heard was static and they had to be disconnected nd reset, noise cancellation was spotty until finally one of the microphones quit working all together.  Now, every time I move, one pod has consistent crackling with said movement.  I'm not a huge Apple guy and this def made me even less of one.\", \"I really really really wanted the pros to be better than the original AirPods I used to have put sold when they kept falling out of my ear. These are better, but still have some of the same issues. I will say that I've never experienced such great noise cancellation — but these are also the most expensive headphones that I have ever bought. I loved that everything synced so well with my other apple stuff — that's why we keep buying Apple, isn't it? But the kicker for me was that still, even though they tested all these ears, even though these headphones cost more than my car payment — they STILL FELL OUT MY EAR. And that's all I can say because it's really emotional. I was upset. I returned them. And now I'm back to the bootleg headphone life.\", 'I loved this product from the day it was announced. Super portable, easy connectivity and very good battery. My primary purpose is to use this for my laptop and workouts. As much as I loved the way it worked in my laptop when I am idle, I wish it gave same experience for workout. First 2 days it was great for workout. Then one side started moving due to sweat and moved up a size from medium to large earbuds even if I have to give up noise cancelling. Few days that also started slipping and I can’t even use it when I am idle. I would recommend this only for non work out purposes. It does not qualify as a workout earbud.', 'I would like their option to \"locate\" them when you lose them would be better, to see their location you have to be close to them and to activate the sound to look for them the case has to be open ... so if you are a little far away or the case  is closed it will be impossible to locate them ... which seems silly if they are close to you then they are not lost (I lost some before and there was no way to know what happened to them) and trust me these headphones are so easy to lose', 'These pro’s would be fairly good given a few basic design changes. I hate the small stem and the force touch buttons. My sausage fingers can’t hold them as well as I should. The sound quality is not up to par with other headphones in this price range. I did prefer the sound profile and calibration than my Sony’s. The deal killer for me is the silicone tips!!! They fell out at the slightest movement. I tried all 3 tips and none of them fit well enough. I’m returning these and going back to my original AirPods.', 'A solid upgrade over the originals, these iPods, while pricey, are worth it imo.  The fitting tool works well and battery life is on par with what they suggest (much better than the originals from what I can tell but perhaps only bc they’re new). However, the case is larger and not as pocket friendly.  And the shape or design of the AirPods are easier to drop since the stems are shorter and angled.  First time around I put them in the wrong ears.  Noise canceling is impressive and comfort is exceptional as I often feel pain in my ears after extended use of other ear buds. Connectivity to my iPhone XR is automatic 95% time where as the remainder I have to manually prompt.', 'Was excited to buy these, and finally got them at a decent price, but after receiving them and updating the firmware I noticed the noise cancelling feature does not work right, they refuse stay activated when turned on, reverts back to off on their own. Tried repairing, nothing has worked so I have returned them. Very disappointed for the price Apple charges for them. Sound quality could be better also, especially for the price.', 'this is the second head set i order. the volume does not work you can’t hear sound when volume is below 60% the left headphone stopped. really disappointed in apple support and amazon. i don’t understand why the send a defective product. there no controls for lowering the volume you  have to ask to Siri for permission lol siri sucks and is always freezing. the battery only last 3 hours so you  to carry the case with you. don’t lose it!! does someone know how to turn of the airpods bc i don’t the instructions are not very clear', 'So, I love music and listening to audio books, but I hate earbuds because, much like Warren in \"there\\'s something about Mary\", I despise things in or around my ears.  The airpod pro are a different story.  They\\'re comfortable all day, the battery lasts at least 8 hours on one charge, and the sound is amazing.  I don\\'t understand how they have so much bass?!!!!  The mic quality also is great.  Just buy them.', 'A jillion reviews have been written about these. I didn’t care about most of the features; however I now appreciate them. No need to turn them on and off, the case makes it easy to carry around in my pocket, the ANC and transparency mode, the oval shaped earbuds - all great features.  Well worth the upgrade from my BeatsX.', \"Not having the greatest experience with other earbuds, I didn't have much expectation from these. However, I found that they fit great, and stay in while doing most any activity, including weight lifting and workouts. Sound - I was super impressed with the sound. They are a bit bass heavy if sealed properly, but it's not horrible. Really gets you feeling the music. Most all other frequencies are decently reproduced. You can't expect perfection from earbuds, so these are pleasantly surprising and rich sounding for how small they are. Fit - No problems at all. They stay in place with everything I've thrown at them. I like the fit test to let you know they're sealed good too. Noise cancellation and transparency mode - This is what sold me! The noise cancelling is great in environments that have continuous droning sounds. Airplane? Awesome! Mowing? Incredible! I can actually listen to music while mowing and not have to have it so loud it may damage my hearing. Transparency is great for me at work. I can edit video, but still hear coworkers that need me. They charge fast, and have a good long life. I'm so happy to have ditched corded earbuds that get nasty and in your way at the gym. I did have to go through Apple for a repair. The left pod started crackling when I'd talk in both transparency and noise cancellation mode. Apple was quick to send replacements, and they're still going strong. Good product, and fast service when a problem arose. Even with that, I'm satisfied with them, and have had three friends buy some base on trying mine.\", 'I have the original AirPods and boy are these a STEP UP!  While I love my new Raycon E55 earbuds (very easy to pair & connect), but the PRO is the 👑!  I never have to unpair to use with my other Apple devices—just have to  select Connect and that’s because  I have a number of Apple devices (Pads, TV, MAC, iPhone) and I love that feature and the noise cancellation works!  Now I don’t have to wear Bose headphones to get that feature which makes me really hot (that age of hot flashes) even in air conditioning🙄', 'These are pretty nice earbuds They fit well, the sound pretty good, could use more bass. The noise cancelling is really good. The biggest con is the battery life. I got 4 hours off of one charge. Not the charge pretty quickly in the charging case but if you have to do it every 4 hours it gets rather old. That is my biggest con on these though. Great pair of earbuds regardless', 'These sound good but I am unable to get fit test to pass.  I also tried some third-party foam tips but still do not pass fit test.  This is key for noise cancellation so for that reason noise cancellation rating is low. By now Apple should have gotten these to be fool proof for this kind of price, but they are not. If I had known this much fuss for proper fit, I would not buy them.  I don’t recommend buying unless you can get to an Apple store to test fit a pair.', 'These are so awesome!  I have had various versions of noise cancelling headphones. These are the best I’ve found. I work in my woodworking shop a lot and have never been able to listen to music while dust collectors and various saws and tools are running. It’s like having ear plugs in that play music.  With these new Air Pod Pro’s I can clearly hear my music without cranking the volume to 11 even while using my table saw and very loud dust collector.  I’m in heaven.', 'I ordered the AirPod pros after I had the AirPods for over a year and a half. I wore out the AirPods! The air pods were awesome. I thought the pros would be even better! Wrong! Big rip off! They suck! You cannot tap on them and answer the phone. They don’t stay in your ears. The rubber irritates your ears extremely bad. What was Apple thinking. About the AirPod pros 12 days ago and I am giving them away. I just purchased another set of the airpods! If you were thinking of buying a set of AirPod pros don’t do it!', \"You'd think that $250 would get you headphones that work.  I loved my original air pods - had no issues pairing, worked automatically when I popped them in my ear, sound quality was good, and everyone could hear me when I talked. These, on the other hand, are certifiable pieces of garbage. - Pairing is clunky and doesn't work half the time - Noise cancellation flips on and off randomly - People on calls can't hear me half the time, and say I sound muffled - Buds don't automatically connect when I put them in my ears (even though that option is switched on in settings) I've had iphones for the last several years (with very few issues)... but good god this product is a galactically disappointing hunk of junk.\", \"Don't buy these if you aren't on the Apple ecosystem. These are a massive pain and do not work properly with Android devices or PCs. When connected to my phone (Google Pixel), the volume is so low that it's almost inaudible outdoors or in a non-silent room -- I was able to fix this for a while using some online troubleshooting steps, but can no longer get it to work after an update. Bluetooth pairing sporadically doesn't work with my computer. I'm using some old wired headphones for phone calls, Zoom calls, etc. now, and they work much better than this $250 paperweight (though honestly, the case is nice and light so it's not a great paperweight). The one Pro: the noise canceling functionality is awesome, so they serve as great earplugs. Don't believe the articles online that say these work with non-Apple devices.\", 'These are by far the best ear phones I\\'ve used.  I grew up with the fancy over the ear type but they weighed a lot and were hot.  The AirPods Pro are light and cool., But the sound is amazingly clear and precise.  Very good frequency range with rich bass sound for such a small device.  With the noise cancelation on, nearly blocks out all surrounding sounds, TV, talking, etc.  But click the \"transparency\" button on your device, and you can instantly hear all surrounding sounds such as when flight attendant speaking to you.', 'While expensive, these earbuds are just far, far better than anything else in the market. They’re small and very comfortable, with plenty of tip options. The noise canceling is second to none. It’s amazing to wear these while vacuuming or mowing the land and I can barely hear the machinery. The sound quality is excellent and it holds a charge for a very long time. After being disappointed sith cheaper earbuds, I finally I just bit the bullet and forked over $240 for these and I’m so glad I did.', 'What a waste! I purchased these November 2019.  December of 2020 one pod started to crackle, the other wouldn’t charge, and when it did start charging now the two pods won’t link together. Called customer support and I’m no longer under warranty. To buy ONE new AirPods will cost $90. DONT waste your money on these. Oh yeah, my AirPods 2 sucked too. Apple has gone down hill quickly!', \"Positives: I received my Pros earlier then anticipated Picks up sounds from the other room pretty well Options to customize the buds that work for my ears Purchased the Pros w the cheapest price of $234 vs $249+ from competitors for the “new” pros Negatives: The customize buds were a little hard to take off from Pros and I wonder how long they will hold up before ripping (if I want to switch them out again) The smell from the pro case is pretty intense. I would say a chemical smell perhaps. I didn't notice this w the 2nd generation Pods I didnt realize the USB cord supplied w the Pros was different & I don’t understand why they changed it to work only with the USB C power adapter. Note: The old version USB adapter (XR/XS models for example) will still work to charge the Pros\", 'Very disappointed, great tech pack inside, faulty design, for an individual like myself who workouts on a regular basis, having a dependable headphones is crucial, AirPods pro are exceptional when it comes to noise cancellation & sound but the problem exist when your ear canal starts to become sweaty, earphones because of having lack of either ear hook and butterfly who rely only on poor silicone tips that only come in three sizes the earphones will start to pop out and felt down out of your ears or you gonna spend time adjusting them in your ear canal which is preposterous for something you pay $249. Very disappointed, hope that helps', 'They malfunctioned after two days. ANC flipped on and off randomly very quickly, right transport controls were gone after one day. Could only control from left. I returned them. I probably would have kept them if they never got messed up, and then they were out of stock when I needed a replacement. Apple wanted me to pay full price to repair them.', 'These were expensive. Less than the Apple store but still expensive.  However, having had multiple other ear pods over the years these are easily the best quality and best working that I have owned.  They sync with my phone instantly.  It’s easy to check the remaining battery level and the recharging case is excellent.  A great feature.  Won’t buy anything else again.', \"In 2019 it was all about getting the new Apple Airpods Pro's but it was a challenge to find them as they were sold-out  in many areas. I decided to purchase them via Amazon as I couldn't wait for my local Apple store to get them back into stock. Last week, which was almost 1 year later they went dead on me which is very odd for a quality Apple product.  Yesterday, I took them to my local Apple store for repairs and it was communicated by their customer service team that the device was counterfeit and not truly made by Apple.  It was definitely a lesson learned and my recommendation is not buying anything from Apple on Amazon.  The Apple service representative shared that this is happening often as customers are coming in daily with the same issue.\", 'I\\'m typically an Apple product fan. I swear by the AirPods, and even loved the wired EarPods. But I had to return these AirPods Pro. No matter which size ear piece I tried, even buying highly-rated after market memory foam ear pieces, the things just didn\\'t want to stay in. And when I tried keeping them in with, my ears end up hurting. They wanted to slip out just sitting on the couch, laying down, talking or eating. Hoping they\\'d stay in while walking, working out, running - no way that was happening. The sound quality was 4/5 (very rare, slight crackles on certain notes/sounds - most probably wouldn\\'t even notice). The noise cancellation actually blew my mind the first time I used it outside. And the transparency mode is nice when you want to hear what\\'s going on around you but don\\'t want to the AirPods Pro out of your ears. But the cumbersome ear feel, discomfort, constant \"slipping out\" sensation - this is a dealbreaker for me. Especially for $250. So it\\'s back to the 2nd gen AirPods for me. A few less \"extras\" but they stay in my ears (sometimes I forget I even have them in!) whether I\\'m sitting on my butt or running several miles. Hopefully Apple designs earpieces that fit like AirPods/EarPods - then I\\'ll give them another shot. Until then, I\\'m perfectly content with my 2nd-gen AirPods.', 'I put off buying AirPods for a long time until the pandemic happened. Quarantined, I wanted to be able to move around freely while listening to music or talking on the phone. These work so well. They charge quickly, they have long battery lives, they pair seamlessly with Apple products, and using Siri with them makes me feel like a character on Westworld. By far one of the best recent investments in my life.', 'I’m loving these earbuds! The sound is great, the noise cancellation is great and the functions I’ve used so far are exceptional. The phone call sound and function work very well and I LOVE that woman’s voice that comes on, without startling me, and tells me that I received a text and not only by who but will read me the text if it’s short and even tell me the emojis that were used! I highly recommend these since they also stay in my ears better than any other earbuds that I’ve gotten!', 'To me any headphones prices at $ 200plus is overpriced but I figured why not try since it would be my first pair of air pods.  So these headphones DO NOT stay in my ear while sweating or hard workout movement . While I walk I have to constantly adjust them into my ear even when not sweating.  Every time I would do planks they would fall out of my ear . Very annoying I guess these headphones are overpriced because of the name apple .', 'Well what can I say, I bought these apple AirPods Pro as a refurbish items.. kinda hard to give a review when you hear refurbish like..” what do you expect!” But ! I most definitely wouldn’t ever do that again. If your looking to buy AirPods or any electronic purchase buy it NEW, I had mines for less then 2 months now. Mm , welll It’s starting to act up as in cuts off noise, so times the other party doesn’t hear me well, vise versus they don’t hear me and I would have to restart to make it work, good thing the features work. Super comfortable but! If your looking for sound and want to hear clearly from the other party as well as talk stick with the 2nd Gens AirPods. Thank you for reading', 'Loving these!! I’ve never been the type of person to ever need headphones (don’t usually listen to music in my free time) but when I got my spin bike, the cords from the headphones that came with my iPhone kept getting caught on the handlebars and I decided to make the leap and get these. THEY ARE AWESOME. Was skeptical of the noise cancellation since they don’t cover your ear, but IT WORKS GREAT. So impressed. They are also very comfortable and do not slip out at all. THE ONLY DRAWBACK: They do not come with the brick to charge them. Not sure why the one end of the cable isn’t standard USB like everything else, but I just used my iPhone charger and it’s fine.. just real lame on apples part. Other than that, I highly recommend the pro AirPods!!!', \"These airpods are not all they claim to be.  Many of the features that are attractive on the original airpods are far superior to this model.  They are not optimum for ease of calling and or ending a call.  They seem to be designed for listening to music.  I received my shipment when I was leaving on vacation and did not take them with me.  When I returned in mid October I began trying to use them and after about 1.5 weeks wanted to return them, but found the return window was closed!  Now I am stuck with $200 worth of worthless product.  Don't buy these unless you just want to listen to music!\", \"Ear itch and need to slowly pull out one pod? Hopefully you aren't on phone call, airpod hangs up. Have an apple device nearby you don't want to connect your airpods to? Too bad, you will be connected anyways.

Otherwise just so f i n g annoying.\", 'My wife took my regular Apple Airpods so I was \"forced\" to buy new ones. The Airpods Pro are so much better. The music clarity is perfect. The Airpods Pro are so much more comfortable than the regular Airpods. I\\'ve worn them for 8 hours straight and forget they are in. The noise cancelling is fantastic. They eliminate all the background noise making the music pop. I hope my wife takes my old Apple watch. :)', 'I like the overall design and the noise cancellation is awesome. They sound very good and the press and hold menu options are great. The only reason I had to return these is because they would not stay in my ear for long periods of time. If I was actively exercising or just walking around for a period of time I would probably loose one. I have to admit this is a great product if you have the ears that will hold them in place. I gave it four stars because they just would stay in my ear with out trying to twist them or constantly trying to adjust them to seal. Hopefully the next new pair would have a longer nose to them so that they will create a better seal. Or just maybe an optional ear loop designed by Apple.', 'Honestly, i was sketch about these, and the main reason is that i am very particular to my skull candy head phones that have great quality. First i want to say this, the head phones are a little big for my ears so it took getting used to, like wearing for a few hours and pulling them out when they hurt and then putting them back in later to get my ears to adjust. However i want to say that because of this i almost returned the ear phones. It was until i was able to really see how seamless the process of getting them connected to was i keeping them for that, the noise cancellation is really cool. They even have an option in setting to get the right fit ear bud in it. The audio is ok, not the best but not bad. I still think my skull candys are better for quality but over all these will be kept for the convenience it gives to me.', \"I've had these for a little over a year and the volume has gone out!!!! This is not something I'm accustomed to with Apple products. Not only the volume, but the battery does not stay charged for a long time. I unpaired and repaired the airpods and now they randomly disconnect from my paired iPhone! I will need to return.\", 'I got these headsets for my wife. This was her first set of Bluetooth headsets. She just loves it. She uses this for all her calls and music. I have a pair of Bose Soundsport free and compared the music between the two. I must say that Bose sound output is much much better than these pair of headsets. I would say I was disappointed. For apple, at this price point, I was expecting the music quality to the level of audiophiles. That is why I gave it 4 stars.', \"There's not a whole lot to say about the AirPods Pro that hasn't already been said multiple times over.  They sound great and have been a true joy to use from the moment I took them out of the box.  They've performed flawlessly, the connection has been consistent, and the battery life is excellent.  In my experience they're well worth the price - I highly recommend them.\", 'I just got this fantastic piece of technological miracle packed with lots of newest features. However, it is not even close to the product description of LIKE NEW. The case has lots of scratches and the ear pieces do not give satisfactory noise cancellation at all. Please do not misunderstand me, I have another pair of airpods pro, which give me a very good noise block from outside world. When you buy something from Amazon Warehouse, please beware what you get might be something far from the description Amazon gives. I am a bit disappointed with this purchase.', 'I bought these for my husband to give me for Christmas. 😉 Consequently, I haven’t used this pair yet. However, I did wear my son’s. These pods do so well at cancelling noise. I’ll hesitate to wear both buds unless I’m stationary with my back to the wall. The sound quality is great. I haven’t tried the battery life, but my son has no complaints. So excited to use these in 79 days. 😁', \"I use them for conference calls and listening to music, doing chores, turning down the noise when I'm using the blender or coffee grinder or lawn mower or circular saw or when the kids are on a screaming bent. They're fantastic. Only issue is that the volume is really low when paired with ubuntu bt, and even that doesn't bring this below 5 stars they're so fantastic with iphone and apple laptop and apple tv. They switch between devices easily, sound great, comfortable (I installed some soft foam tips). I love 'em.\", \"Was a big fan of the 1st gen airpods..used them everyday. The Pro's are a great addition. Noise cancelling and transparency modes are quite good, they are more comfortable and also looks better in my opinion. Are they the best sounding wireless buds? No, but its practicality its beyond this world. Especially if you surround yourself in the apple ecosystem.  I used the 1st gen airpods everyday for 2 years with no issues and loving every minute, I'm expecting the same and more out of this. Definitely worth a buy, you can take these bad boys literally everywhere.\", 'The best ear buds I have ever used.  I have very small / tiny ears so most buds hurt me.  These come with smaller adapters you can put on and it works perfect for me.  The microphone sounds like it\\'s underwater in most situations, unfortunately. The nice cancellation is great, and being able to switch to \"transparent mode\" means you can leave them on when engaging with others.', 'Not impressed with the noise cancelling performance.  I am a huge fan of the AirPods (which I have had since they were initially released) and was hoping to use these to replace my over-the-ear headphones. UNfortunately the Apple AirPods Pro simply cannot match over-the-ear headphones. I tried these in the office and on a plane.  On a plane they were simply embarrassing and provide little to no noise cancelling performance. I have returned this product.', 'Amazing noise canceling technology.  For safety, you definitely need to be aware of how to switch between the three different listening modes when using outside.  These shut out a lot of ambient noise. Wife gets pretty annoyed when I wear these in full noise canceling mode when she’s feeling chatty.  (Translation = these are great!)', \"I have all generations of Airpods all excellent but the Airpods is just perfect !!  The design is really good, the gestures really comfortable, (1 click to play / pause, 2 clicks to the next track and 3 clicks to the previous track), the quality of the microphone in excellent phone calls as always.  And the most amazing thing: the Noise canceling, it just works well, I travel on a subway or in a plane and can't hear all the noise around!  It is important to note that the quality of the plastic in the charging box is cheaper than the previous models...\", 'I love the new Apple AirPods pro ! Connectivity with Apple devices could not be any easier. The sound quality is excellent as well as noise cancellations. The fit is also  excellent. You can hardly feel you have them on and they don’t fall off. I hated all prior Apple AirPods. But Apple got it right with the Pros’ ! I have also the Sony which has better sound quality but not by much but I prefer to use the Apple AirPods Pro !', \"Sound quality is good, but expected outstanding from Apple, and especially for this price (even tho I got them on Prime Day). Sound is comparable to the wired earbuds you get with your iPhone.  Finger controls are tricky to learn, and overall comfort is just so-so.  Don't regret my purchase and love using them, but maybe should have shopped around more.  Noise cancellation and battery life are excellent.\", 'I was hesitant to buy a pair of these just because they felt like the latest trend, but I am very happy I did.  They are easy to use, charge fast, and are the ideal headset for work. They also stay in your ear well for just about anything. The battery life is as advertised.  Use them all morning, slap them in the charger at lunch, and then use them all afternoon. That being said, they should only be sold for the $150 price tag they went for over Black Friday.  The audio is rather flat compared to other headphones that I own (Bose Soundsport) that are around the $150 range ($130).  If you are interested, I would wait to see if I could snag a pair for between $150-$200.', \"I really love the connectivity, the ability to change from noise cancelling to ambient sound, and just about everything else you could want in a sport wireless headphone. They have fallen out of my ear a couple of times while super sweaty on a long cycle but they held up to the fall just fine (not even a scuff). The battery life isn't bad but I do have to charge them more often than I thought; however, with a good charge they never run out during my long rides (2-3+ hours).\", \"These headphones are very sleek and of nice quality. I really wanted to be able to use them long term. However, even after minimal use with listening at normal to low volumes, these headphones hurt my ears! A little bit with the physical shape of the headphone, which could be alleviated by inserting them very lightly/minimally into my ear, but mostly with my hearing itself. My first few listens to music and podcasts, with noise cancellation but fairly low volume, my hearing felt strained and muffled afterwards. I didn't think much of it initially but the problem has persisted and gotten worse upon each additional use. I reached a breaking point a few days ago after talking and listening on the phone for about an hour. Right afterwards and ever since my head has been ringing and my hearing feels sensitive to even normal sounds. I fear long term damage to my hearing if I keep using these so I have returned them. I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled to because I'm young, listen to a lot of music and podcasts, and have never had hearing issues like this before.\", 'I tried an off brand which luckily were an off brand price because shortly after I realized I should’ve just gone with Apple. I am a huge Apple fan and own tons of their products. The Air Pods Pro do not disappoint. Fit so comfortably for different ear sizes, sound is excellent and noise cancellation is almost too good because you end up so immersed in whatever you’re listening to that it’s almost like being inside the music, movie, book, etc. Battery life seems good and charging is quick. Highly recommend!', \"connect very seamlessly to my bluetooth, charge super quickly, good sound quality i think (to be honest im not a very good judge of this). the charge lasts a while, and unlike other bluetooth headphones i dont have to bring a backup pair to the gym just to get through a 1.5 hour workout. they do fall out of my ears fairly easily (i will never wear them on an outdoor run, i'd be too scared to lose one for that) but this is an issue i have with nearly all in ear headphones so i won't dock any points for that.  These also don't hurt my inner ear which many other brands do, so i'm happy with them.\", 'These are a great pair of headphones to some degree. Certain areas perform really well such as the active noise cancellation “ANC” and the ambient mode feature. However, these are not a great pair of headphones for anyone who is active and sweats a lot. I play basketball/workout almost every morning and without fail, these AirPods Pro would fall out of my ears multiple times throughout my workout. With that being said, I wouldn’t recommend these for anyone looking to purchase a nice pair of headphones for workouts unless you are doing light cardio/exercise. At this price point especially, there are much better options to choose from. My biggest issue is that the left AirPod stopped working after just 3 days. I have since returned them and decided to go with the Powerbeats Pro by Dre. For workouts or anyone active, I definitely recommend the Powerbeats Pro!', 'Ive never had so many problems with charging wireless earbuds. Typically one will charge, not the other - despite cleaning, air, tapping the charge button, etc. It typically requires both AirPods be removed from the case & air blown into each one, perhaps additional cleaning. My original AirPods are far more reliable & I am so glad I kept them. These AirPod pros get occasional use because of how finicky they are to charge. It usually takes 4-5 charge cycles to even get them to respond. Super frustrating. Happy I still have my basic AirPods.', 'These sound great and really make music come alive.  I have two pair of Air Pods, I’ve been using for several years, and compared to those, these have much more bass response, due to the rubber seals.  The best bass response is with the tips of these pointing toward the top of the head.  I also like the convenience of being able to charge the case, wirelessly.  I highly recommend the AirPods Pro.  They will make your favorite music sound great.', \"I had the original air pods and they were good until my husband borrowed them and didn't return them. I'm really glad he did because these are AMAZING!!  the noise cancelling is like nothing I've ever experienced. I mow my lawn with them and hardly hear the mower. battery is great, very comfortable and great fit. also works great for phone calls. I'm very happy and would highly recommend.\", 'I use these for running. They are very comfortable and never fall out. So far they have been sweat proof and I sweat a lot in long runs. My friend and I often share music which is a great little feature. I also love the Siri read text feature so I dont have to pull out my phone while I run. The battery is perfect length. Four hours for the buds and I can get two full charges out of the case. Expensive but very worth the cost. I also own the regular AirPods. These are worth the extra money.', 'I upgraded from AirPods 2 to the AirPods Pro because I like earbuds that “plug the ears” (as opposed to just resting on the outside of the ear canal).  I’m so happy with the AirPods Pro!  I use them to take Zoom calls and to teach virtual fitness and yoga classes; they stay secure the entire time!  The sound quality is excellent (I love the noise cancelling feature), and they charge pretty quickly! I highly recommend them!', 'If you have more than one Apple device I do not recommend these.  Owned these for about 5 days.  I have iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch.  Instead Of automatically connecting to the device you unlock and intend to use they just randomly connect to whatever and constantly need to go And manage in settings.  Tried using them for running.  Had music playing through my phone and Nike Run Club app active on watch.  Once I hit 1 mile and NRC app announced my first mile time I can no longer get these to reconnect to anything.  They show connected to my phone and my watch but sound is GONE.  Had a cheap pair of knock offs before these And they did pose some connectivity issues as well , however I only paid $15 for them at a flea market.  Don’t waste your money if you are looking to seamlessly transition from one device to another.  For the price these things should be reasonably intuitive and maybe even Heat up your lunch for you.', 'I work in a server room doing IT work. These will cancel out the server fan noise and no one on the phone will hear the noise!! They have a surround sound effect while watching Movies/TV shows and works pretty well. You can toggle between serval hearing settings and one allows you to hear what’s around you while playing your music (perfect while running/jogging, as you will still be able to hear cars etc). Batteries drain at different speeds though with the earbuds, left side will be at 20% and right at 45%??', \"I've been using it for 5 weeks approximately and these airpods suddenly started to make a weird cracking sound. Like if there was connection failure. I paid the extra cash for the noise canceling benefit. It sucks that it's not working like it was designed to.\", 'Noise cancellation control a cool feature. You can tune out or tune into the world around you at your discretion without stopping your music , phone call, or audiobook. Had to return these because they wouldn’t stay in husband’s ears. They kept falling out all over the place. All three included ear bud pieces couldn’t secure the ‘pods’. For comparison, the original airpods stayed in his ears while riding a motorcycle helmet-free, exercising at the gym, mowing the lawn, etc. these are quite different that the original, and will work for most people', 'I’ve had the regular AirPods for 2 years now and decided to get the pro for who knows what reason. I got them, they are cool, the noise cancelation feature works well. The sound quality is not mind blowing and honestly I don’t feel like they sound much better than the regular pods. Also, I’m missing the tap feature, you have to “squeeze” instead of tap which is not good if you use these for working out for example. If you don’t have any pods, sure, go for the pro, but if you already have the regular AirPods, I’d say save yourself the $200.', 'Love the sound cancellation affect. Used that on a flight and was very impressed. Battery life for that flight (4hrs) wasn’t great but they lasted. I had gotten a message that the percent was 10% when we were beginning the decent so it ended up being pretty great. I also like how well they stay informed. I have used these on a few runs and was very impressed. I didn’t think they would stay as I’m used to actual sport headphones but they were perfect. And not using the noise cancellation was perfect to hear any approaching vehicles or general outside noises. Overall great headphones and I’m glad I bought them.', \"Nice sound quality, excellent noise cancellation, not great battery life unless you don't mind taking them out and waiting a few minutes to charge enough to keep using, but... After about 3 months I started hearing distortion from high volume sounds (both playback and my voice) in the right air pod. Now I can also hear clicking in the right pod if I move my head back and forth. Something came loose inside. I don't recall ever dropping one of these things. If I did, it should have survived without damage like any other $250 ear buds would. Update: A couple of months the left airpod did the same thing and had to be replaced. Lowered rating to 2 starts.\", 'Great earbuds! The integration with my iPhone and Apple Watch makes it well worth the investment. Super easy to use, and so far the battery life has been solid. Noise cancellation is top notch. Love the ability to change from transparent mode and noise cancellation with a touch and hold of either earbud, instead of having to take the earbuds out every time someone wants to chat. Audio quality is very good, but not “blow you away” spectacular. This is coming from someone who uses Shure 846 earphones every week, so maybe I’m a bit spoiled on audio quality.', 'I bought these to replace my 3rd pair of BeatsX which had a decent sound. These have an \"mkay\" sound. Almost every reviewer said their sound was fantastic or at least really good. It\\'s really not that great. It lacks mediums and trebles are way too muddy, especially for in ears. Noise cancelling is very average as the sound isolation is not really great with these very short ear plugs. One thing they\\'re good at though is convenience. They are just perfect to have around, just put them in and enjoy a video or music on the go. Plus noice cancelling and sound being what it is, it\\'s still pleasant being able to go out and maybe work with some noise cancelling on and a quite decent sound quality. So if you buy them for the convenience or just because you want to look rich or because you overly enjoy Apple, go ahead. If you seek sound quality and performance noise cancelling, these aren\\'t for you.', 'Seriously for the price send the whole damn charger or make the lighting cords all standard. I do not feel these are worth what amazon is charged. If apple would minimize their packaging they could cut out a lot of cost. They do fit nice with 3 tip selection. Not very noise cancelling like my over ear Bose and about the same price. The in ear are nice on a hot day though.', \"I cycle a lot. Sometimes more than 400 miles per month. I am finding that the charging contacts inside the case, and on the AirPods Pro themselves, will corrode. They corrode to the point where the AirPods Pro will not charge. I must frequently scrape off corrosion from the case's charging contacts with a needle, which is difficult. 6 months after purchasing the headphones, I regret getting rid of my Trekz wireless headphones for the AirPods. While they are great in every other aspect, the amount of care required to keep them serviceable during physical activity is more than I want.\", 'The AirPod Pros work great with my iPhone. I bought mainly for the noise canceling technology hoping they work well while mowing the lawn. I haven’t tried them mowing yet but they seem to work great just walking outside. The sound is much better than the phone that are included with my last iPhone and phone calls sound great.  Much better than Hilda phone to your ear or using the phone speaker.', 'I purchased these as a gift for my husband who absolutely loves them.  He keeps them nearby as he does not like phone conversations with the phone on his ear.  I will say though, with some consternation, that these are not for everyone.  I have a hard time keeping this type of device in my ear unless it is painfully shoved in, and even then it falls out after a few minutes.  So, a great device for those who can wear them.  I’m both happy for and jealous of those who I see wearing them.', 'Look, these are clearly the best wireless ear buds with their advanced noise cancellation and transparency. It’s actually absurd how well that technology works. Siri works great, the AirPods are fantastic. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because they arrived with a broken left ear bud. I had to take two trips to the Apple store, which ran diagnostics and replaced the left ear bud for free. Now they work fantastic but definitely just go to Apple instead of Amazon’s market. You don’t know what you’re getting when you get from their market and you could run into similar problems.', '', 'Good product and easy to connect.  I connect it to both of my iPad and iPhone.  The AirPods were working flawlessly until the past couple of months the sound would be off whenever I get a notification (email, tweets, and etc).  Every time when it happens I need to deselect and reselect AirPods.  Contacted Apple and they asked me to update IOS.  However, the problem still persists.', 'If they fit they work great if they don’t they are decent.  Would recommend trying before buying. Sound cancellation is great for cutting grass can barely hear mower. Pass through mode is okay but there is hissing if you are using this mode. Would recommend only if you wear earbuds for multiple hours a day or if you wear them for noise cancellation. Overpriced of course but I got them at a good deal.', 'I am highly impressed with the noise cancellation. I put them on and walked by my pool pump outside, and couldn’t hear it running. I actually had to GM take a double take and make sure all was well. It’s also worked well traveling with others that like to watch videos on their phones without earbuds. You can put these in and drown them out.', 'The AirPods Pro are everything I hoped for. They fit my ears and I haven’t had any problem with them falling out. The sound is better than any ear buds I’ve ever had and I like the noise cancellation feature.  I like to watch movies on my iPad when I fly and these filter out airplane noise better than any ear buds I’ve ever had. I imaging ear phones would do a better job of that, but they are too bulky to carry around.  Since it’s an Apple product, they work seamlessly with all my Apple devices.', 'Temporarily this is a great product...then it begins to develop tics...and the batteries begin to degrade...then the constant hum and occasional screech sets in.  I have tried all the fixes online to eliminate the hum to no avail.  At 6 months of use, I had to stop using them.  My previous non-noise-canceling Apple air pods also failed...but lasted longer...a year and a half.  They totally malfunctioned and will not pair with any device.  Again tried all the online fixes. These are expensive products for such a short functional life.', \"The sound quality is ok. Noise cancellation is great. They fit into my ears very well. Right, if your charger port is traditional type A USB, the included cable is useless because it's type C USB. I will buy a new charger when iPhone 12 is released. Edit: All kinds of issues came up recently: unstable connection, long beeping sound when I turn on or off the transparency mode. ... About to return it. Right, I changed the 4-star rating to 1-star.\", 'I am sorry I waited so long to get these. Worth every penny. I now listen to audio books in half the time it takes to sit and read them because I can clean and cook while I “read”. Listening to music is therapeutic and my husband and I can enjoy our favorites at the same time. Battery works well. I keep case charged and have had no issues.', 'I was very scared to purchase these on Amazon just because I wasn’t sure just how good they would be but I got them on sale it was so worth the buy! I love to wear them when I’m cleaning the house or go out for a run they fit into my ears perfect and they even came with extra ear pieces so they fit perfect for anyone’s ear! They hold a charge so great I don’t have to charge them for usually a week!', 'As an avid Apple fan, I am sorry to say the AirPod Pro did not work for me.  They always would slip out of my ears and when I would try to adjust them, whatever I was listening to would pause etc.  I also found that my hair touching them made them noisy in transparent mode.  I had to turn that feature off as it was quite distracting. If they had the same fit as my original Airpods, I would have kept them.  I returned them and replaced them with the latest AirpPods.', \"I've used all three ear cup sizes and none keep them in very well. No volume control, you have to control volume from the device that's sending the bluetooth signal. 5 billion transistors in my phone and sound varies widely from different sources. It's a hazard to someone like me with sensitive hearing.\", 'Great packaging that you would expect from Apple. Great quality sound.  The noise cancelation makes these great for trips or working in the yard.  I like the convenience of wireless charging.  I do find keeping them in over an hour starts to hurt my ears. The case is easily scratched and not built for durability which is to be expected.  The lid does have a little wiggle to it, not tight as I didn’t expect.  Battery last long.  Charge time quick.  Opt for a cheap carrying case and you’re good.', 'I really didn’t understand what the hype was around these AirPods (or AirPods in general) until I got these. I figured they were overpriced and probably similar to other Bluetooth headphones that I could get on Amazon. I was SO wrong. The transparency mode and noise cancellation is amazing. Far better than any other headphones/earbuds I’ve ever had. If you are on the fence about buying these….. do it!', \"Do not buy these to help you sleep.  This has been discussed on Apple support and Apple says the  LOUD low battery alarm cannot be turned off.  If you use these to fall asleep by playing something or using noise-canceling they will wake you up at 3 am with a LOUD alarm that cannot be controlled in any way.  Just to clarify, the alarm is LOUD and is not controlled by anything.  If playing music quietly or just using noise-canceling a very loud low battery alarm will sound and there is no way to use them and get even 5 hours of sleep without getting a startling loud alarm.  During the day the alarm wouldn't seem that loud but after hours of silence it's LOUD and can't be reduced or eliminated according to Apple Support.\", \"Airpods arrived barely charged and with no charger. There was a cable, but its different from other apple products and can't be plugged into a USB, or frankly any other type of port that a reasonable person would have. Classic apple forcing you to buy more stuff just to use their products. I get it, but a heads up would have been nice. I just spent $200+ on something and can't even use it.\", \"Everyone I talk to with these can't tell the difference compared to just my phone, the noise cancelling tec is way better than I expected but with it off I can hear ambient noise at a slightly quieter sound level than what I'm listening to, 5 hours on 1 charge is about right- I only use one ear piece at a time so I don't have to stop listening to music throughout the day, I thought I was gonna rip the rubber part when I changed it but it did pop straight off when I pulled hard, I even got a bluetooth adapter for my pc and I use these for gaming too(had to go with a PCIE card), *note the button on the back of the case for syncing is a actual button, I use these with a galaxy s8 plus - for voice assistant I had to go with google (have not used it enough to say much) and I use assistant trigger to see battery life\", 'Let me start by saying: I have never written a product review in my life.  So for me to do this;  I am IMPRESSED! I apologize in advance if this is all over the place. I tend to jump around. So. Keep up. I am mainly writing this review to touch on some of the questions I had prior to purchase that I could not find a sufficient answer to. First: The sound quality is fantastic. I had the AirPods V1 (until I lost them) and purchased these hoping to upgrade in every aspect. Sound quality is much much better then V1. Second: Noise cancellation, it works. Quite well I might add.  It’s not completely silent. You wolnt sit here and listen to the voices in your head only.  Prior to purchase the main question I had was about using them on a lawn mower. When noice cancelation is turned on and you start mowing, you can still hear whatever you are listening to.  I was listening to a podcast on almost 3/4 volume and had to turn it down at times.  You can still hear the mower bog down and Slight engine noise if you try. So you can mow without issue hearing what’s going on while listening to medium volume media. Third: “transparency mode” I have never had any device with this before so I am pleasantly surprised.  When turned on the outside world is slightly louder but you can function normally I life and hear everything perfect. Forth: the pods stay in your ears... very well.  The first test I did when I put these in was the shake test.  I did as much shaking of my head until my peanut between my ears had bounced off the walls of my skull enough to give me a headache.... and the AirPods did not move one bit.  That’s a successful test.. minus the headache. Fifth: they are quite comfy. Leave them in all day and not have any “tight” feeling in your ears. In summary: I cannot recommend these enough.  In every aspect they are worth the price.  If you are on the fence, do it. Buy them.', 'I was so excited to get the AirPods Pro! They came brand new in all the original packaging and clean, but there was a small dent on the box they were in. The AirPods themselves were in perfect condition. The sound quality is really nice, and I can definitely tell the difference when using the noise cancellation mode. Obviously all noise is not completely drowned out, but it makes it to where the outside noise will not interfere with whatever you’re listening to which is really convenient. The battery life is pretty good too! They were extremely easy to set up as well. It literally took me less than 5 minutes to set up to my iPhone and I’ve been using them with no issues ever since. The only downside is that the charger base/adapter is not included with the item. So if you do not already have a base that fits the USB-C end then that could be annoying. But the AirPods case can be charged with the regular Apple charger that you use for all the recent iPhones or on a wireless charging device. Overall super satisfied and happy with my purchase!', \"I am more than pleased with my purchase of the new Apple Airpods Pro.  I am a headphone junkie.  It would take me too long to list all of the models that I have used and owned over the past 2-3 years.  Also better that my wife doesn't know the truth.  I just sold off my Bose QC35 and bought the Airpods Pro.  I also have the Jabra Elite Active 65T. I have to say that the Airpods Pro were a great upgrade.  Music quality, while not as good as the Jabras is more than good enough for me.  The Noise Cancellation works very well and the Transparency mode works the best of any headphones I have used.  The new design fits tightly in my ear which is a big change from previous models.  If you don't mind the high price, these are clearly the way to go.\", 'My product box is empty.', 'They don’t fit my ears, hard to get in, fall out easily, sound quality not that great, volume is poor, you have to squeeze the stem to do any actions which cause them to fall out of your ears. I have the old version of AirPods and I like them. I like the tap feature to do actions. In my opinion the ‘pro’ version have failed me. I sent them back.', 'I purchased these after using apple products for years. Absolutely awful experience. Had to return earbud due to buzzing, which is apparently a known issue. Replacement would neither charge properly nor hold a charge. Went thru three “repairs” including having to drive to their “genius” bar. Each time the on-line and in store service was awful: repeatedly requiring me to re-enter information, waiting in line when I had a scheduled appointment, sending in airpods for “repair” and getting them returned indicating they were repaired, only to find the same issued upon return. A complete waste of time. One fourth try “advisor” asked again to “troubleshoot” or given option of a “callback” at 11pm. WTF? Gave 1 stars as zero wasn’t available option. Ordered new sony earbuds. Hoping for better experience.', 'They block out noise really good. They work with our Apple TV. They fall out of your ear easier. Also they changed the plug on the charging cord. Had to buy one separately. That was very annoying.', 'WOW, watching movies are non different with the regular airpods. I say you don’t need to upgrade unless you’re an apple junkee or need that noise cancellation. but I’m happy with the transparency feature. I say its good but I still keep using my amiron wireless. these airpods are good for walking or activities where you sweat but for audiophile listening I’ll stay away from it. spatial audio is just marketing gimmick. can’t hear the difference when watching movies.', \"I bought these at the beginning of the pandemic to block out my kids while I worked. I wanted to love them, but I can't. The microphone has never worked right--people constantly tell me it sounds like the noise around me is being amplified and my voice is too quiet. That lack of basic functionality is a deal breaker. Then, the noise cancellation started going. At first is was a little static noise when I started running that went away. Now it's a burst of loud static every time I talk, chew, or move. They drive me crazy and are useless for anything except sitting completely still at a desk. Needless to say, I will not be forking out the extra cash for a replacement set.\", 'These were fake airpods. Dead on arrival Christmas Day. Did not charge and would not pair. Gummy and blurred tags on box, loose packaging and missing cable and std docs. Returned immediately but now 22 days in and still no refund. New pair from Target worked like a charm.  Disappointed getting these fakes from Amazon.', 'I can’t stress enough how over priced and underwhelming apple products are. From AirPods to the 12 and across the board. I hate these products and miss my Samsung. Now low tones poor top end volume. They did get noise cancellation right. I like the fit as well. I’m just constantly disappointed in apple. Like a poor version of every other brand.', 'Better get and Tile tracker and attach to it, lost mine including the case in about 4 months... - - - Pros - portability - noise cancelling on such a compact size Cons - comfort   - not able to keep it on my ear for over an hour without feeling discomfort - microphone quality   - I had people complain about my microphone quality on crystal clear Signal calls - lack software customization, only a few toggles to adjust with (see screenshot)', 'When I first bought these, they worked great. Simple set and operation. Then the crackling noise started. I contacted Apple because they were fixing this problem. They had me reset them. It worked for a couple weeks and got me through their window of free repair. Now they sound worse than ever. The crackling is so annoying in both buds, I went back to jbl’s Apple’s quality is going down hill fast.', 'Recently purchased these over an also well know brand ….bottom line the sound quality surpassed the competitor!!!  The battery life suffers  sure Apple realizes this little flaw …..The recharge time is unbelievably fast to make up for its  down time !! Still Would recommend over Beats ……Cant wait for a new version with longer battery life and even color choices (black) preferably!!!!', \"I've been listening to a few friends rave about the Airpods Pro for many months, but after finally caving in and getting my own, I understand the raving. These things are GREAT! The Active Noise Cancellation is killer, the sound is great, and the integration with my iPhone is flawless. I recommend them to everyone! (NOTE ON FIT: If you think they don't fit, try EVERY ear tip size for BOTH ears. One of them will work and not necessarily the one you thought you'd need.)\", 'The good: 1) Easy to set up with your Apple devices or multiple in my case 2) Wireless charging 3) Helps block out the sound of the lawnmower when I am cutting the lawn. The bad: 1) They do hurt my ears after a few hours of use.  I have tried different silicon ear pieces which seem to help a little bit. 2) The noise cancellation is ok, but nowhere nearly as good as my over-the-ear Bose QC35s.', 'this is a game changer - I was in love with my Bang Olufsen (cabled) but decided to give this a chance - they are more than I expected! I normally have problems with earpods but these fit very well (perfect does not exist) - only problem is that they are so light and easy to carry that I already lost my first pair… apart from that, excellent product', 'I’ve been using the regular AirPods 2 for close to a year now. These are such a huge upgrade. The noise cancellation is amazing. Even when music isn’t playing, these make some great noise canceling earbuds. These are great for me, as I almost can’t hear audiobooks or podcast in my noisy work environment, that problem is solved now. The sound quality is overall better as well, with a little more bass. They fit so much better and don’t fall out. It’s worth the extra bit of money, especially if you grab them on sale. No other wireless air bud can compare.', 'The sound is good but cuts in and out. The pro comes with different attachments to fit your ear.  I used a medium for one ear and small for the other. They still don’t sit well.  They have dropped out of my ears several times while wearing. I bought these for airline travel but am afraid if I lay my head down they will be on the floor.  Disappointed!', \"I don't usually write review but I'm definitely not happy with the products. I purchased the AirPod Pros versus the AirPods to have the latest version that I didn't have to upgrade for awhile. I think that was a big mistake. These earphones do not stay in my ear. They often times fall out when I'm doing simple tasks like walking. I've switched out the little ear things and they all still just fall out. Sometimes I can just be talking and one will take the jump of its life. I ended up also buying the Samsung earbuds and those fit my ears so much better. I'm keeping these to have as a backup but definitely would recommend Apple make them for more ears or more like the curve of the instead of an ear. Also, my Pros seem to die rather quickly.\", 'I bought these on a whim and thought I would regret the purchase. I never did. I was living in NYC at the time, and noise was inevitable. With these bad boys I could attend online classes with zero issues: it drowned out the window AC, construction upstairs, and the incessant car honking outside.', \"Out of the box these were unable to connect to any of my devices. I tried first on an iPhone 10 to no avail, and then later to a MacBook Pro. The airpods will continuously flash the white, connecting light. It has taken a little over a month to get a replacement pair, but I am still waiting. First a genius bar appointment was cancelled, and the instore people couldn't find a receipt because it was purchased through amazon. Finally after calling amazon they connected me to apple support who had none of the details on the purchase and the phone conversation took longer than necessary having to explain 9 digit serial numbers over a shoddy phone connection which eventually disconnected. I ended up having to dispute the charge with my credit card company. I wasted hours of my time which are much more valuable than the product itself. 0/10 customer service.\", 'These are amazing!! I love how you can activate noise cancellation and how the sound is in the perfect quality. I wish that this product had better battery life. I use my earbuds almost 24/7 and it sometimes get aggravating to stop and charge them when they’re dead. Nevertheless, these are Apple products, so I was expecting the highest quality and it exceeded my expectations.', 'They don’t fit in my ear.  If I’m chewing or laughing they automatically pop out.  If my ears sweat... pop out.  Yoga, pop out.  I bought some ear lobe extra support, which helps but eventually if my ears sweat, they lose traction.  They also have issues connecting to my iPhone 12 Pro with latest software.  I’ve had to restart my phone a few times to recognize them.  They also automatically connect while in the case, requiring me to manually change to speaker or whatever.  And sometimes they won’t connect at all while in my ear.  Wait.  Don’t buy these.', 'I have been in several, long, and frustrating discussions with Apple customer service in my futile attempts to purchase Apple Care plans for these two gifts I purchased on Amazon on December 29, 2020 and I have gotten nowhere with Apple.  In the future, and I would recommend to others , I will purchase the Apple product and the care plan from Apple at the same time.  One problem is the serial number shown on the product detail receipt.  Both of my purchases start the serial number with an S, which is not really part of the serial number.  The best way to find the serial number is to take a picture of the barcodes and numbers on the box and then enlarge the picture until you can read it, because it might be different than what is on your receipt, which was just one of the problems I ran into.  The actual products are not with me but are where my children live.  Unless Amazon starts selling care plans, buy your product from Apple if you wish the care plan.  Amazon had overnight delivery, but it looks like, we are just shucks out of luck with puchasing the care plan', \"I would love to give these five stars. They sound pretty good. They're very comfortable. The noise cancellation and transparency modes work really well, and the convenience features are great. But there is a terrible smell. I don't smell it from the Airpods Pro themselves, but from the tips and the inside of the charging case. A strong sickly chemical smell. So I don't want to use them for fear they might be unsafe.\", 'I don’t how Apple does it but they keep producing market leading products like these earphones. These earphones are outstanding. Love the noise cancelling function at the press of a button. Who comes up with this technology?? Amazing. I buy / try a lot of different earphones - Bose, Jabra, Sony. These Apple earphones are, by far, the beet I have i have owned. Not cheap. But you get what you pay for.', 'This is a quality product and worth every penny, if... I needed good in-ear wireless Earbuds for the many conference calls I have. Come to find out that it is impossible to make them work with my windows laptop. And when you follow all guidelines and make it work, it’s only for a day. The next day you log on you have to spend the 30 minutes again To have it connect to Zoom, Skype or Teams. For pairing them with your iPhone and listening to music these are the best. NFC is really good and the sound quality is not bad either. Wish they would have worked with a Windows laptop.', 'I’m not an Apple fanboy but these are AMAZING! I cannot recommend them enough, seriously, I tell everyone how great these are. The sound cancelling is the best feature ever! For example, when I cut the lawn on my commercial lawn mower, I put these in with my music at half volume and it completely drowns out the lawn mower noise. The battery lasts days without charging the case and they are durable for I have dropped them countless times and not a scratch on them. Seriously buy these or gift them!', 'I have two sets of Bose noise cancelling headphones, both over the ear, one blue tooth and the other wired. These are just as good if not a bit better. Battery life lasts longer than I need. Being in the case they are always fully charged. Syncing is never an issue and they drown out the noise perfectly. I use the smallest cup for my ears and sometimes they loosen up especially when I am doing something very strenuous. Dropped one of them into a bucket of water when I first got them and figured it was ruined. Put it into a bag of rice and left it overnight and it worked the next day after putting it back into the case. Truly amazed with these....', 'Unfortunately, these are a bit too big for my small ears. I’m not talking about the silicone tip that goes towards the ear canal, I’m talking about the pod itself. I could barely fit the pod in my left ear (it kept popping out within minutes), the right was ok but only for short periods of time. They are wonderful quality, the sound is amazing, and I was hoping they would work for me (the original AirPods were way too big for me as well), but I’ll have to wait until Apple designs something for child size ears.', 'The AirPods were great for about 3 days. My right one is not connecting at all now. It is fully charged and will not connect to Bluetooth when I take it out of the charging case. I’m EXTREMELY disappointed because of the price of this product. Don’t waste your time with AirPods Pro, my 2nd generation have better sound quality, and didn’t stop working after 3 days.', \"now i really don't like apple products 99% of the time for being super over priced and usually worse than most things out there but these are the best truly wireless earbuds ive ever had the noise cancelling pleasure of owning. definitely worth the price tag. putting these in for the first time and witnessing all the ambient noise quickly fade away a few seconds later was an experience. the sound quality when listening to music or other media is as good if not better than anything else out there not specifically designed for audiophiles. the battery life is a bit short compaired to other headphones but can still reach five and a half hours easily with even more available when recharged from the case so most of the time i only need to charge them once every few days.\", 'I bought these for sound cancellation at night. They do not last through the night. Around 2 an, My husband’s snoring wakes me up and the AirPods are dead. Sound quality and noise cancellation are excellent, but battery life is poor. No more than 6 hours.', 'I like em, but my ears ring well after use.  EMF Radiation exposure to the brain with the short/long term effects are not worth having the pods anymore.', 'I was sceptical about buying them at first. Since I’ve heard reviews about the 1st and 2nd gen always loosing power and or sound going out within a month or a week. But these are great. They are very secure in my ear don’t have a problem with them falling out. Very light weight. Love the noice cancellation when you are a mom of 3 trying to make dr appointment it comes in handy lol. It’s worth it completely. Just buy the insurance which I highly recommend.', 'The best in the market. There may be variations for ear sizes n shapes (obvious given our human uniqueness) They the have option to adjust. It may not be for all though — but They fit me perfectly— I teach meditation, yoga movement, & strength and conditioning digitally. It’s the best money to Invest. I also had construction workers across the street near me. I CANT HEAR THEM. noise cancellation is insane! I wish the battery life was longer but I use them so much it makes sense - good thing they charge super fast—  Apple is the boss. I purchased this product with a ‘ pela case’ Case to Protect the box,  they are the best in the market when it comes to sustainability & saving the planet.', 'I love everything about these ear buds except they don’t stay in my ears and I’m afraid I’m going to lose them.  Noise cancellation and sound quality are amazing!  If I am sitting still and not moving, they’ll stay in.  I use these for work and connect them to my laptop.  I use them to watch movies, listen to music, and while talking  on my cell.  While talking on the phone they tend to wiggle their way out of I’m on too long.  There was one time I went to push an ear bud back into my ear tighter and I pushed a button that hung up on the caller...my supervisor.  I have had these ear buds for roughly three weeks and use them daily.  I am still debating on whether to keep them or not.  I really do like them but I’m not sure if I want to keep dealing with them falling out of my ears.', 'Amazing! Noise cancellation is pretty good the sony cancellation headphones are a bit better but I feel like that’s an unfair comparison since the Sony ones are the best on the market and this is apples first noise cancelling product. They charge very quickly I haven’t really noticed shorter battery life like everyone says, and I can work out with them and not worry about them falling out my ears or getting damaged by my sweat so that’s a bit nice. Would definitely buy again!', 'Amazon had lost my package. But they did send the replacement after investigation. Kudos to the service. I have used many wireless buds, this one has to be the best. Noise cancellation works fine, sound quality is also good. Battery life is not the best, but not to complain about. The only negative point should be the price. If price is not an issue. I would recommend this buds', 'I’ve only had it for a year and 2 months and the right AirPod won’t sync anymore after an update. Have the charging case in 2 separate protection cases and rarely ever drop them but after updating my phone, the right one stops syncing. It charges and pops up in the promo that shows you how much charge they have but the second I take it off the charge case, it’s like they disappear. They won’t even make that chime that indicates that they’ve connected. Tried calling Apple but they wanted to charge me 289$ to repair it!?!? They’re only 189$?!?! It’s hard to trust Apple with these over hundred dollar gambles like this. Especially with customer service this bad, it’s like they want them to break right after the warranty on purpose.', 'I tried a few of the cheaper ‘true wireless’ earbuds because $200 seemed a bit expensive, but in the end I wasted time and about $70 testing out other models that had weak bass, poor connectivity, and wonky battery life. I gave up and bought these, and man are they worth the extra $$! The first song I listened to was Mike Oldfield’s Five Miles Out and by the time I was three minutes into it I was beyond overjoyed and the sound quality and clarity. Bite the bullet because these are worth the money.', \"I love the Airpods Pro. Several Pros for the Airpods Pro. Sound quality is great. Phone calls are clear on both sides of the call. If you're looking for active noise canceling these are the headphones for you. My only Con is the headphones when I took out the headphones sevwral times  I had a liquid come out of my ear and then it became very itchy apparently I was allergic to something on the ear tips. I am not sure of the material of the ear tips but beware of allergies. I had to return the Airpods Pro.\", 'Bought these for my husband, who is a long distance runner.  I liked the feature that you can hear traffic while still listening to music.  Sound is great, noise cancelling is great...everything is great except that you cannot adjust the volume if you run with a Garmin watch and don’t want to carry your phone.  Everything syncs beautifully except volume!  The music comes on ***full blast*** in the earphones, and you cannot turn it down on the Garmin.  He googled and tried every work around, but nothing worked.  So disappointed!!', \"Love the noise cancellation.  Its pretty incredible.  I can go walking and can't hear the kids playing, cars passing or the highway noises, lawn mower noises or other city noises.  The sound quality is good and I've gone 4 days before having to charge them (and the case).  They provide a variety of ear coverings to choose from so they have a good fit.  You can choose a different covering for each ear if you need to.\", \"Battery life and fit were disappointing about this able product. unusual for an apple product really because I like the old buds better. longer life and better fit. new ones will drop out when you're moving if you aren't careful. good for one and a half movies and then you have to charge. maybe not even that long. Volume could be louder. It seems you almost have to take the volume to 90%.\", 'I just listened to my new AirPods 2 for the first time. I played my favorite music that I have been listening to for decades. I have played it on several audio file speakers and great studio headphones, but I have never heard it the way I did just now. My eyes were wide open while I heard the voices of my favorite artistS That sounds good better than I have ever heard them. I have never written a review anywhere remotely close to as good as this one. I would recommend that anyone who loves music like I do don’t even think about buying anything else.', \"I have never owned headphones that did not have an over the ear piece because I could never find headphones that fit my ears.  The earphones that used to come with a new iPhone never fit so I assumed AirPod Pro's would not as well.  Wrong!  The 3 different size ear pieces ensure they will fit your ears & then the ear test shows you which size is best for you.  They have incredible sound and stay in even in the Florida heat when I am exercising outside.  Highly recommend these, especially for people that are hesitant because wireless headphones do not typically fit their ears.\", 'Wouldn’t stay in my ear - tried the different size cups but they would slowly work their way out while I was working. The sound cancelling is pretty incredible but not perfect.  When I was around beeping sounds it would throw it off and you could hear it trying to work. I usually kept it turned off but it’s a nice feature. Sound quality is very nice with the noise cancelling. I ended up getting the updated first version. For me they just work better.', 'Couldn’t get these to pair..and was freezing my phone when trying to connect..sent them into Apple certified store who sent them to Apple for repair..Apple sent them back stating they were not authentic AirPods...never will purchase an Apple product through amazon Apple store ever again !!!', 'I am a big fan of Apple products and have been using iPhones for more than a decade now. I was waiting for the upgraded AirPods to replace my second-generation AirPods.  It is definitely worth the wait. Apple AirPods Pro is amazing and sound quality is outstanding with noise-cancellation. It fits perfectly on my ears. I will listen to music at least 2 to 3 hours a day at work and battery life is really good. I will buy two more AirPods Pro for my spouse and son.', \"I got these for studying and talking on the phone/Zoom meetings. For studying, they are fine. The noise cancelling leaves a soft static-y sound, but you can kind of ignore it (kind of). For talking, however, they're a nightmare. They won't stay in my ears. The motion of my jaw when I'm talking/eating wiggles them loose, and they're constantly falling out. I tried all sizes of the silicon tip, tried wiggling them in further, tried cleaning them and my ears before use... nothing. They just won't stay in. I have been using wired earbuds for years (the Apple buds, as well as several other brands), and have never had this issue before. If they were $20, I might be able to work past it, but for 10x that, I expect a product that doesn't fall out 5 minutes into every presentation I've given. I am returning them for this reason.\", \"I've been an android user and used the Samsung Galaxy buds plus. I then transferred to these. Obviously these are better since they have active nc rather than passive. Noise quality is a little better on this when it comes to the vocals. Bass is better on the buds plus. The quality is much better though and it's fluidity on iOS is great. It's overpriced, but what do you expect from Apple.\", 'I ordered these for my child who deals with Misophonia and needs noise cancelling devices to sleep. While they are very good at doing what they say, I feel it is VERY misleading that description states \"The Wireless Charging Case delivers more than 24 hours of battery life.\" What that actually means is that the CASE stays charged for 24 hours - the AirPods only last for 4 HOURS. How is that at all useful? For $235.00 that is a ridiculously short amount of time that they are actually functional and we are very disappointed. I am currently looking for another option and will be returning them.', 'I was against AirPods for the longest time, similar to my hatred for business men with Bluetooths back in the day. Fast forward, my husband bought them for me and I can’t stop using them. The list of what they are convenient for is astonishing. From business to pleasure I have been utterly satisfied. Meditating at home but dogs or kids are too loud, not an issue. Want to take a nap but you are afraid of getting twisted in cords, no problem. 4 stars because if your ears sweat and you are working out it can be a bit difficult to manage them. Either way, I’m not a big gym gal so 10/10 would buy again!', \"FAKE - serial numbers of the actual pods do not return on Apple's website. Buyer beware\", 'The sound was great until the right side stopped working.  The when I unpaired them and reconnected them it didn’t say AirPod it was something written in another foreign language.  I reconnected three times and the side never worked again.  Even tried to do the sound test and the test kept saying both pods need to be in your ear to test and they were.  Luckily I was able to return them without any problems.  I wish they did work.', 'These are not the best sounding earbuds I’ve ever heard, they are not the noise canceling but they are the most comfortable ones I’ve used. They have good sound, great noise canceling and are very comfortable add in all of the apple specific things that are available and it makes them great. There are my goto earbuds over my Sony WH-XM3s.', \"Pro: Comfortable, sound quality, noise cancellation is good yet not at the level of an over ear headphone ie Bose Con: I use my Airpods almost all day long.  The previous generation would last me a full day without needing a charge. So far the Pro's on average need to be charged at least twice a day.  By my estimate the battery life is roughly 1/3 of the previous model. Overall: Solid product but given the price point the battery life should meet or exceed the previous model. It's possible there is a way to make them last longer that I don't yet know of in which case I'd update my rating to 5 stars.\", 'I never thought I would buy into the air pod craze when they originally became popular but after quite a bit of research and a recent change in working remotely from home, I decided on the the air pod pro model. They comfortable once your ears get use to them and the sound quality is unparalleled. I ended up purchasing an additional pair for my Mom for Mother’s Day. She since has rediscovered her love for listening to music and gets excited to dance around her apartment in quarantine. This is a double thumbs up!!', \"I finally upgraded to wireless ear buds and tried the original base level AirPods for a week before returning them. Amazon had an amazing deal for the AirPods Pro and boy do they make a difference. The silicone inserts for your ears really make sure they stay in and they really improve the sound quality. I'm also very happy with the noise cancelling since it doesn't introduce a bunch of positive pressure in your ear canal.\", 'Sound quality is great, but about the same as standard AirPods. The noise cancellation feature is absolutely incredible. I don\\'t like how instead of tapping the ear piece to skip tracks or pause, it\\'s now a pinch motion on the stem. It\\'s pretty impractical while working out or running. Also you only get the charging cable. No block. And it\\'s not a standard USB cable. So over $200 on the pair and still had to go out and buy another piece to be fully functional. I probably wouldn\\'t have gotten the pros based on the \"upgraded features\".', 'I ordered these hoping they were better than the first 2 versions of AirPods. They’re okay. I wish they had more bass. The regular sound is good. I bought the Powerbeats pro to try them out and decide which I like better, the beats had slightly better quality but the bass sounded artificial (I think now because apple owns them) compared to the beats x I had couple years ago. And the power beats pro charging case was just too bulky for me. I don’t think the AirPods Pro are as cracked up as the apple site and other online reviews makes them to be, I am definitely a bass chaser. I love the ability to go from noise cancellation to transparency. The charging case is the perfect size, I just wish the pods had higher battery capacity and had More bass, and for $250 you’d think they would. I decided to keep these instead of the Powerbeats pro. It’s surprising how you can put them in just like the original AirPods or EarPods and it’s sealed, No having to screw them in your ears like the competitors. And they’re comfortable. Overall I think I’m satisfied with them.', 'I’ve only had the little earbuds that have wires and come with your phone or iPad and a very inexpensive pair of wireless earbuds.  The difference is night and day.  The AirPod pro really does noise canceling and listening is excellent.  I don’t use them (so far) for phone calls, and haven’t even tried it.  For what I listen to, it’s just fine and easy to pair and operate.  No complaints.', \"I've been using these around the house and I am in love! the noise cancelling is perfect for traveling or in a busy office. While I don't think the noise cancelling is on par with over ear headsets like Bose or Sony, the freedom of mobility offered with these true wireless headphone is second to none. I have especially like the transparency mode. It's a must have for anyone traveling on two wheels and has made my bike commute significantly safer.\", 'I never thought I’d buy these things.  But after my friend highly recommended them, I finally relented.  I own professional, on-stage in ear monitors that are par with these buds.  They fit well.  One thing I didn’t even realize was that they are ANR! They cut out a lot of noise.  The sound covers the entire spectrum. Both podcast and music listening is quite enjoyable. Worth the money. Get them.', 'These are the most comfortable in-ear pods I’ve tried so far. I almost forget I have them in after a while. They also did a decent job with the balancing inner and outer ear pressure. You don’t get the high levels of “inner body noise” phenomenon as you do with other in-ear sealed buds. The fit is also better than the regular AirPods and don’t fall out as easily. Noise cancellation isn’t as good as a couple of other brands I’ve tried but it’s good enough to enjoy fuller sound without having to turn the volume up to damaging levels. Overall, these buds / pods are a great balance of comfort and noice cancelling tech.', \"I first want to say that I love these headphones. For the current price point, I feel that they are a great value. I love the noise-cancelling. It's definitely noticeable. I was amazed at the difference. It literally feels like it silences the world around you.It was so good that I had to turn the noise cancelling off in order to hear my TV in my house. I want to say that the only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't like the fact that u cant adjust the volume on the airpods themselves, you have to do it on your phone.\", \"Battery life.  I'm getting about three hours.  They won't stay in my ears.  I have tried all of the included sizes.  Every (EVERY) time I bend over, one of both pop out and bounce accross the room.  They are worse when sweating.  I love the sound transparency mode but the noise canceling is a little weak.  I bought these because of the claim that they could be used for the hearing impaired.  That was a flat out misrepresentation.  Great hearing and microphone quality when used with my iphone 11.  Any suggestions about keeping them in my ears would be appreciated.\", 'Volume is too low. Sound quality is ok I guess, kinda flat. Only updates firmware when it wants to (no way to manually update). I had issues with one pod not connecting.  Apple replaced then there was a crackle, Apple replaced. Now I’m outside of warranty and it sounds like the speaker is blown. I can listen at low volume, but if I equalize my ears or yawn there is a loud crackle. I get a high pitched feedback frequently. Overall definitely not worth the price. I bought a knockoff at CVS, the sound quality wasn’t great, but none of the other problems, they are still going strong for $20.', \"For 250 bucks I expect it to have some decent connection while using them. Problems: They stutter so much Sometimes one AirPod loses connection and the other works Sometimes both don't even play at the same time Sometimes it doesn't even connect to anything For the price I'm paying it should have good bluetooth connection. The Noise cancellation is whatever, it clears up the audio more than cancels noise. I'm wearing them right now and I can hear the fan that's blowing on low power in my room. Also, I've had two pairs of AirPods pro, and they're both the same.\", 'The noise canceling feature is great, but I use transparency mode the most!! It’s so useful to listen to my music while letting me keep an ear on what’s going on around the house. The only thing I wish was better about these is the battery life. It seems like they use battery even when inside the case, so if the case is at say 15% or less battery life, the pods inside will also lose battery. I’ve had them go from 50% to 17% just from sitting in an undercharged case. BUT!! That’s not to say don’t by them. I think they are a great product and are worth the money.', 'Awesome! Sounds amazing. It fits the ear great which makes the auditory experience truly immersive. The noise cancellation and transparency are quite useful and well-done. Amazon has a good price compared to other sites. They make such great gifts as well. Feel like everyone of all ages can use a pair of these.', 'I was really skeptical about buying these off amazon rather than Walmart or something like that especially because they were a lot cheaper but I just bought them anyway since the price was better here thinking I would jus return them if they were sketchy. But they were totally fine. They came sealed and they were brand new and squeaky clean. I’m very happy with this purchase. This is for all the peeps who are a little skeptical. It’s totally fine go ahead and buy them', 'Good quality, noise cancellation is amazing, i work on excavators most days and the Diesel engine along with the safety alarm can be annoying overtime but with the noise cancellation i cant hear a thing even with no music playing and you can tell the difference too because when i have music playing at like 75% with no noise cancellation i cant hear my music at all. Definitely recommend unless you do a lot of dirty hands work as they are very white', 'I use AirPods daily, from meetings/calls to mowing the lawn. I used them for the first time yesterday forgetting they had noise cancelation and started my lawn mower and thought something was wrong with it because I could barely hear it. The AirPod pros are remarkable, very easy to connect, great sound and extremely comfortable to wear.', 'The sound quality is amazing especially with the new update and spatial Audio. Hats off to apple for that. However there are two problem with this product. 1- wireless charging case is not good. At first I thought there is a problem with my case so I changed it and apple send me a new case but same problem. I realized when buds are in the case you can’t wirelessly charge it, I left the case for 24 hr on the wireless pad but the percentage of battery was lower at the end. But if you take out the buds and charge the case wirelessly it works but not as fast as cable charging. 2- It fell off my ear. I tried all the tips, the small size was better for me but still after couple of minutes the seal breaks and it becomes loosing up. I use it in gym but every 5 minutes you need to fix it in your ear. I would say it stay better with body movement rather than jaw movements or chewing. If you want to eat and listen to something it won’t stay long in your ear.', \"What I like about them: Sound quality is good enough, fit is so much better than the non pro version and you look less like a goober with them in your ears. Noise cancelling is good while you're in a car. Good enough I'm giving them as gifts now. So yes, I like them.  Assuming you use an iPhone you will like them too. Even my Android friends (who dream of electronic sheep) like them too (they just aren't as convenient for them).\", 'These are legit! I contacted Amazon after I ordered out of pure nervousness and they confirmed it was from Apple. Still skeptical I went online and input the serial # and the AirPods popped up. I was able to register them. They also connected to my IPhone immediately after opening them up. I am very happy with this purchase! Update: I had to return them, they were not fitting my ears and it was painful! I wish Apple would work on that. I don’t want to spend $550 on ear muffs. The noise canceling was great, as was the sound, but 10 minutes in the ear and I had a headache from the fit. I really really liked the quality of everything else.', 'These worked well at first. After a couple months black stains appeared on the inside of the case. They will not come off. I have tried everything. Left earbud has started making a static, crackling, blowing sound that will not go away. I’ve tried contacting Apple about but none of their troubleshooting has worked. The sound has gotten gradually more intense? Apparently many people have had this issue and I don’t know how to go about getting a replacement. The cases should really be black considering how dirty they get and how you cannot get rid of stains.. and please for the love of god fix the earbud issue. No one wants to pay 200+ dollars for earbuds that go static after 2 months.', 'Los compré y a la semana los vendí. Muy malos, salí a correr con el celular en un bolsillo y tenían un montón de microcortes, se cortaba el sonido, de la única manera que pude escuchar música, fue llevando el celular en una mano. La cancelación de ruido, cuando la activas, te das cuenta que la música tiene un ruido raro chiquito. Nunca pude pasar el test de sellado y probé con todos los cositos esos que trae. Realmente para el precio que tienen, son muy malos, no los recomiendo ni a palos. Me compré unos con cable.', 'These work perfectly right out the box! Got these as a gift (to myself lmao) and they’re as great as expected. They charge super quick also! (But they also had about half a charge right out the packaging hehe) so happy with these, and they came super quickly and were delivered by USPS so it was RELIABLE AF. Just an extra tidbit for any other Anxious Annies out there', 'checked the serial code with apple, they’re the real deal, noise cancellation works wonderfully, they come with a pack of different sized ear pieces for a perfect fit, they stay in the case very well so you don’t have to worry about them falling out, they connect automatically to your phone when you open the case and turn off automatically when removed from your ears, very pleased', 'Apple has been a frustrating company for me for years. But my girlfriend really wanted these for Christmas and I did research and the headphones are well tuned and such. So I got them and we had fun playing with the sound canceling and listening experience. But then the battery got low... Really apple? Typical screw over. No charging block, the block that is required has a new receptical so you can\\'t use one you may have on hand, and it\\'s rediculously expensive to buy the \"new\" block. What makes me almost sick is apple is doing this to \"save the environment\" they really think we\\'re stupid, now I have to have a new one shipped on trucks and planes in separate extra packaging that will fill the landfills.. So now my footprint is doubled and I\\'m sure a majority of people will be in the same boat. This simple expense mistake by apple has finally converted my girlfriend to the Samsung side. GG', 'I really have not found a single flaw with these yet. I work in a lab and find it incredibly convenient to be able to set timers, read my text messages, respond, change what’s playing etc without having to take off my gloves. To the people who are bothered by not having sound adjustments on the actual ear piece... if you’re in a situation where you can talk, just tell Siri “turn down/up the volume.” I’ll also add that I have -never- liked Apple earphones and whenever I got a new phone or iPod I’d just give them away because even wearing them for a few minutes would make my ears hurt and sore for a day or two. These made my ears a little sore for the first few days, but not to the magnitude that the old designs did and I got used to it quickly and now they don’t hurt.', 'What I love is that I can hear with these like a hearing aid. That I can use one at a time so the battery last longer. The thing I didn’t like is they fall out of my ear a lot! So I bought these holder things from Amazon that work great an keep them in my ear. They attach to the stem & wrap around your ear! Now they never fall out!', \"I had a set of AirPods and I really liked the sound and the fact that everything is integrated with the apple stuff.  But they had a tendency to hurt my ear after awhile.  I thought I would try the AirPods Pro as I thought the cushions that go into your ear would help and they sure do.  The sound quality is excellent and I love the noice canceling feature. I got a warehouse deal and I've been perfectly happy with them and would definitely recommend them.\", 'Upgraded from AirPods to the AirPod Pros. They are more comfortable and stay in my ear better but the \"noise cancellation\" is literally non existent. With noise cancellation on and music playing, I can hear full conversations around me. Not worth the price; AirPods were better for the cost. Would not recommend for noise cancellation.', \"I like the product, but in order for me to be able to keep it inside my ears, I had to take out the rubber tips, otherwise after an hour or two I would get major headaches. I would consider trying it but just be aware that they are almost double the size of the regular wired ones, in addition to the rubber tips. Now, if you decide to try them and return them, BEWARE, here's my story: My item got lost, even though Amazon kept telling me it was delivered. I had to call about six times in the span of four or five days, and all I got was mix messages about where my item was. They actually never had a straight answer. On top of that, when dealing with customer service, it was  extremely disappointing. They used a pretty awful tactic to get me to shut up: They offered me an Amazon gift card not only once but three times, only to learn later that there is no such thing allowed by representatives. They were only trying for me to stop calling them by offering me bogus money that was never real. When I asked to speak to a supervisor about this tactic, the representative put me on hold and then hang up on me. Be weary of where you put your money and your trust!\", 'Great product I absolutely love these AirPods, I’ve had them for a couple months now, I have had no problem with battery life sound cancellation great quality of music. I am running into the issue were one AirPod likes to stop working on occasion, they can be very frustrating but besides that everything has been 100%', 'I was sooooooooooooooooo skeptical about buying these from Amazon, I was NOT disappointed these are Legit brand new Apple AirPods Pro!!!  I have the regular AirPods but these are a game changer. The sound quality is definitely UP TO PAR. The noise cancellation and transparency. Live listen really blew my mind I love that feature a lot lol like a secret spy feature. Plus the battery life is sufficient for hours fell asleep with them on woke up and music still playing', 'I bought these cause they were on sale and I knew that as I get more ear piercings that I couldn’t use over the ear headphones anymore, so I needed a really good quality headphone to replace my Bose quiet comfort noise cancellation over the ear headphones. Well, first off, the AirPods are actually more comfortable for me than my Bose ones. Also, the nose cancellation is 100% better than my Bose. I could barely  hear anything while wearing my AirPods. I also like how they are much smaller than over the ear headphones, so I can wear them comfortably under a hat or beanie. I also like that there is a way to find them if you lose them which is super nice. So I would totally recommend this to any iPhone user who wants a great pair of nose cancelling headphones.', 'I’m an iPhone user so I decided to go with the Apple AirPods Pro. It’s super easy to connect them, unlock your phone, take one EarPod out and immediately on the screen you can connect this device. Love it Also the sound quality is very good, very clear and you’ve some bass, but not too strong I like it very much though When people are calling me the voice is very clear to understand, what do you want more?!', 'The earbuds were great. I loved the sound quality and the noise cancellation feature is fantastic. But I could not wear it for more than 20 minutes without significant ear pain. I was so disappointed. I so badly wanted this. It was so uncomfortable, I had to return it and settle for a second-generation AirPods.', \"As headphones they work great.  I fly usually 8-10 times a year and the noise cancelling is pretty decent.  Overall sound quality is also excellent.  Haven't had any issues with battery life, if it gets low I just pop them in the case for a few minutes and your good to go.  Only complaint I have is using them for phone calls (as others have said) the sound is slightly muffled and people cannot hear you clearly.  Worth the $235 I paid on amazon though.\", \"Apple Product.  Great Performance? Right?  Not really.  I bought the AirPods Pro since my new iPhone 12 doesn't have a headphone jack.  Hence, I can't use my Bose Noise Cancelling Headset with Apple's clunky adapter.  I have been on 8 different flights since I bought them.  The noise canceling is more attenuation than anything else.  My Bose kill the engine and air sounds in a place. I took the AirPods to Apple, they tested and found nothing wrong with them.  But as a precaution, they replaced them.  The replacements are a little better, do not kill the noise.  By the way, I tried all 3 earplug sizes, not much change with any of them. And the microphone apparently in not noise-cancelling as I've received complaints about background noise when using them.  My Plantronics Voyager Pro 5200 kills the background noise. Very disappointed\", \"I thought I could keep using my ear buds that came with my phone but these have been such a blessing.  I've gone out in the garage and left the phone inside and it still picks up my music and my phone calls from quite a distance.  It holds it charge and I love that I can put them back in the case, and put case on my round charing disc and it recharges quickly.  A great buy and really worth the buy.  Got it on a Black Friday sale!!\", 'I absolutely LOVE these AirPods!! They cancel out noise, don’t hurt my ears, and the sound is absolutely amazing!! I had one little issue where only one headphone would work, but when I stuck the silent one in the case and pulled it back out it worked. It also doesn’t want to stay connected to my laptop - which is a Windows Surface. It works beautifully with my iPhone and iPad, however, so I definitely recommend using the majority of the headphones on Apple products!', 'Kind of annoying that it doesn’t come with the cube to charge the device. Gives you The new Apple cord that doesn’t have a USB connector. What am I supposed to do with a cord that I don’t have a way to connect to an outlet. Spend over $200 on the earphones and you still have to buy a cube. So sad Apple so sad!! Do better', 'I bought these in 2019 and I am currently waiting for my second replacement set due to failure of the Sri era causing crackling while you are in a call. The repair (replacement) process is terrible and both times has caused me issues. Either money out of my pocket or now waiting over a week to have them even look at them.', 'Totally disappointed. I bought these headphones for two reasons: noise cancellation and the promise that unlike other in the ear canal earbuds, these have some sort of pressure release. The noise cancellation is no better than adequate.  Not worth the hefty price tag. And, worse, I noticed zero pressure release. If anything, these earbuds created more pressure in my ears. It takes 10-15 minutes after I remove them for my ears to return to normal. As much as I love the original AirPods, I hate these.', 'Un sonido muy envolvente bajos bien marcados, las películas de netflix se escuchan como en el cine, la cancelación de ruido es excelente los use en un avión y apenas se escuchaba algo de ruido básicamente nada de ruido, recomiendo tener cuidado al usarlos donde hay tráfico por qué cancela mucho el ruido, el modo espacial es genial y la pila dura un montón, sin duda una excelente compra.', \"I loved my Airpods, but the Airpods Pro are completely different. I thought they were not going to be secure in my ear because of the rubber earbud, but I feel like they're more secure or at least just as secure. The noise cancelling is also definitely a big plus. Using them in the gym for me is as good as using my over-the-ear Beats Studio 3's. Battery life is awesome for me too.\", 'so i own the sony wf-1000xm3 and sp800n noise cancellation earphones, and these are in the middle of them. the noise cancellation isnt as good as the mx3s, but better than the sp800. same with sound quality, and these have worse battery life than the others. I use android and these dont have any problem working with it or my windows computer. i just needed to download a battery life indicator app and i didnt need to change what the touch sensors do, so it works out for me. but i still find myself using these more than the others for a few reasons. the comfort is better than the other 2, and they weigh less. i have weird ears, so i still need ear hooks with these which work very well. the sp800 also have ear hooks, but they go in slightly less comfortable. with the price of all 3 being close if not at 200, i would chose these if im just looking for some anc earbuds that anyone would be happy with. the wf-1000mx3 are better, but less comfortable.', 'I got these for my husband for Christmas he had the AirPod second version and they just didn’t stay in his ears all that well.  He loves the fit and sound quality out of the AirPod pros they fit in his ears a lot better  they don’t tend to fall out as easily as the first ones did .. He really loves the noise canceling in them especially when he’s at work with all the background noise (he’s a mechanic) it makes his music sound a lot better. And phone call quality is amazing I got him a case protector for them and he is happy with that too.', \"I bought these after trying out my friend's AirPods Pro. I have been using it for about more than 8 months. I have an Apple earphone and a Sony Headphone, haven't touched them since I bought these. Pros: 1. Convenient to use. I have an iPhone, so it works great. 2. Comfy for ears. I have used them for a couple of hours (3-4 hours) straight (full charge to discharge) didn't find them inconvenient or burden to my ears. 3. Fast charging 4. Noise cancellation is good but not to the level of a headphone. You can still hear the surrounding noise but at a significantly reduced level. I haven't had a chance to try out others in this category to compare, so I don't know what to expect. Cons: 1. No volume control. It would be great if they could somehow incorporate volume control. 2. Sometimes, they have gotten loose and almost fallen off. Not clingy like headphones. 3. Pricey. 4. Sometimes, I have experienced an issue while auto-connecting to my phone. One earphone will connect but not the other. Usually, I just put them back in the case and take them out, which seems to resolve the issue. Only once I had to repair them. Overall, I am enjoying them!\", 'Love the features it offers, AirPods Pro have great advantages than the original lacked like noise cancellation and active pass through sound to hear your surroundings. What I dislike about them is the bass for some reason was more depth in the original AirPods, also the new silicone tips do not work for my ears as they don’t stay in place very long like the original AirPods did. I wish Apple would make memory foam option available because it seems with a bit of sweat or long talking the pros start to slip out of ear canal.', 'These work very well at cancelling the noise (there is a noise cancelling option on the AirPods as well as on the iPhone bluetooth setting). The sound quality is good, not as good as my over the ear bose headphone but these are much smaller, less expensive, and weigh next to nothing. Highly recommended', \"I was really looking forward to another great Apple product, but sadly have to report that after trying all three ear tip sizes they always fall out when I'm walking or gardening. I had to buy an after market set of ear hooks that you have to remove to charge. Now that I have the ear hooks I actually use them and love the sound and ease of connectivity.\", 'Sound quality is great. I love the noise canceling option. Great for working from home when it’s noisy. Obviously so very easy to connect to the iPhone. I highly recommend this to anyone willing to spend $200 on earbuds. I upgraded from the AirPods and it’s a great upgrade. Wireless charging is awesome. So easy to recharge the buds-just pop them back in the case for a few minutes.', 'I would have liked to have had a choice of colors but overall I am happy with my purchase.  They stay in the ears without that sensation that they will fall out.  The sound quality is adequate.  The battery life is so-so but with the case and quick charge feature it works out well.  The sound reduction is adequate to listen to music without excessive volume while riding in my diesel truck.  The ability to pause music and put them into transparency mode is very useful when interacting with others without taking them out.  I recommend these earbuds.', \"I love my AirPods so I was really excited about the Pros. Turns out the design of the pro doesn't work with my ears, so I'm glad I got these on Amazon because returns are easy! The sound quality was great and I loved the noise cancellation feature. Transparency mode is weird at first, but really nice. They connect seamlessly to your Apple product(s) and the wireless charging case is convenient as well. If they fit you, I recommend them! If not, try out regular AirPods because those fit my ears and have been worth every penny!\", \"Returned mine for two reasons. 1. Right earbud just refuses to fit. All 3 included tips do not work. I was gonna get a custom foam tip when they start making them because I felt it was worth it but.. 2. 3 days ago I was caught up in the rain. I had my winter jacket on which is also waterproof. I know the airpods are water resistant but I was in no way going to test it out a week after I just received them, so I put a beanie on over my head covering the pods and then my jacket hoodie on over the beanie. Went throughout my commute no issues, but when I come home and take off my airpods I feel that they are a bit damp. Not wet by any means so I wipe them off and put them in the charger. Next time I take it out it no longer keeps a stable connection with my phone, the left earbud has an annoying hissing noise during transparency mode, and there's a ear splitting noise every so often that just makes it impossible to keep it in my ears. So yeah, I highly doubt these are IPX4 rated if they start acting like this just from moisture dampness. I hope I just received a dud, but knowing apple I doubt it. These are still grossly overpriced for what they are tho.\", 'Good head phones! Noise cancellation is truely a work of art! Also, I liked the old headphones design and was a a bit iffy about getting the rubber silicone ones, but they really do feel great in your ears. For me personally, I can’t keep up with having a box, headphones, and my phone charged all the time... Therefore, I gave them away as a gift after a week lol. Still a great product nonetheless!', \"The experience is great and everything that you'd expect from Apple. Sound is excellent. Noise cancellation is so good, it's scary. I don't put them on in parking lots or areas with a lot of traffic because it is so good at cutting out noise that it is almost too good and you can't hear on coming traffic.\", \"Love the airpods pro so far. Sound quality is very good and noise cancellation works fine. I was not a big fan of the original airpods, but these are head and shoulders over. I tried the SONY before and it was not as good. On par as far as the sound, but noise cancellation wasn't as effective and i experience disconnects, every so often. Of course, with this being made by Apple, they work perfectly with the iPhone, but also get automaGically paired with all my other Apple devices. Very nice and simple. Not cheap, but worth the price for me.\", 'Replaced a pair of first generation AirPods and these worked so well - another pair for my wife.  Fit process is wonderfully simple - you end up with a comfortable and useful earbud in no time.  Pairing is about as simple as you can get.  We normally use Bose over the ear noise canceling headphones when traveling - these do the same job and are obviously easier to pack.  The 5 hour battery life is a concern on a long flight, but the recharge time is quick and the charging case does the job perfectly.  Bose headphones are now on a shelf.', 'I’ve had to reset these a few times. Sometimes it’s hissing, sometimes it’s one side won’t start playing, sometimes it’s answering a call and the microphone refuses to start. When I first purchased the, they would pass the “Fit Test” in the settings with both the medium and large silicone ear tips. After two weeks, nothing gets them to pass the test for either size. They still seem to work fine usually, but it’s a concern. But when they work, they are amazing.', 'Ok, these are FANTASTIC earphones. I bought a pair from Best Buy and they were absolutely perfect, but those got lost so I bought another identical pair from Amazon and I was SEVERELY disappointed. They worked fine for the first 9 or so hours but then they quit working... they literally just stopped altogether. At first it was breaking up so bad that I couldn’t tell what song was on but then they just quit working. I knew Amazon sold refurbished and factory blemished stuff but I didn’t think I would get a broken pair of headphones... Needless to say DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, YOU WILL REGRET IT. Just because they’re the cheapest, doesn’t mean they’re the bestest.', 'Having problems with charging? Don’t worry, if you put them away a little sweaty, the contacts in the case get corroded. Don’t worry, Apple will call it water damage and charge you $87 for refurbished case. Or was it $89. Either way, if you sweat they won’t warranty the earphones they clearly depict people exercising with... boo for Apple.', 'Everything about these is what you would expect from apple, high quality, and well engineered - expensive! I have jabra elite 65t for comparison these sound better when someone is talking to you but they lack bass. Jabra has more bass but it is not as clear on the middle and high tones! So the sound quality is above average. In my opinion. If you like bass don’t waste your money. They are just adequate and that’s it.', 'I use these mostly for working out or when I’m outside doing yard work or mowing. The noise cancellation feature is great. They work best when paired with my phone or another Apple product but surprisingly as with most Apple accessories. The sound quality isn’t the greatest I’ve noticed when I use with my work windows-based PC and MS Teams. Lots of periodic static.', 'I just got these and was very hesitant to spend that much money on AirPods.  My brother has these and always raves about them so when they went on sale I bought them.  They’re seriously fantastic.  The sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is game changing. It totally elevates the listening experience.  I’m not sure about the battery life yet but so far, I am absolutely not disappointed.....even a little.  I was a little concerned because I have a daith piercing in my ear so I wasn’t sure how that’d work out with earbuds but it works out great.', 'My husband ordered these under the impression they were a new product. They are not. The were already \"named\" when he sync\\'d them to his device. He thought I did it, I thought he didn\\'t. Neither one of realized what happened until after the return window passed. The product works okay-- the non-pro ones we have are better. I don\\'t know if the decrease in performance is due to them being used or just a subpar product. Since they\\'re apple, I\\'m going to assume that it\\'s because they\\'re used. DO NOT BUY.', 'I should have known these were defective when the return window was really short (like 30-days or less).  From the beginning there was crackling and sound quality was terrible when taking a call.  Pods don’t hold a charge long either.  Very disappointed and feel like this was a crap piece of merchandise that was resold or defective!  The seller should do the right thing and replace them!  Or Amazon should step in to question why the return window was so short?  Did the seller know something?', 'Those AirPods Pro’s are AMAZING! First they fit securely in my ears even when I move or run.  Set up was a breeze. The first thing I noticed was the noise canceling, out of this world. Sound quality is so balanced with enough bass and treble. I believe they are hands down the best in ear headphones around. If I had to say something to improve, it would be battery life, even though 5 hours is not bad but I have in ears that lasted 10 hours but than the sound quality was not as good.', 'Sound quality is pretty good! Noice cancellation is good, but not amazing. These are definitely better sound quality than the Beats Pro’s and their connection to the iPhone is much better. I honestly was surprised that they didn’t stay in my ears as well as I was expecting, especially when I exercise. And sometime, even when I’m not exercising, they will just fall out of my ears. Nonetheless, I do like these, but I would recommend getting plastic hooks (on Amazon) that can really help them stay on while running/ exercising.', 'The slightest sounds are really loud for someone on the other end of the phone. Sounds like opening a letter, light wind, or doing little tasks while you’re talking are extremely loud on the other end of the phone that I end up just stop using the airpods and put it on speaker. They’re great for running or listening to music though', \"I don't know what the ravings are all about. These are impossible to control calls, music, thru the earbuds. For a runner/cyclist, these are Impossible to stay put. They tend to slip over and over, to the point that they weigh one down, and make one feel fatigued, from an item that is almost weightless. Quite disappointed with such an expensive pair of Apple airpods.....\", 'I thought these would be an occasional use item. After having them for a month, I have used them every single day. They make great phone calls, the noise cancelling blocks 75-80% of the noise, but the game changer for me was the previously unknown to me “transparency mode”. I can listen to my music and still be fully in tune to my surroundings. They even talk back to the Health app. Stove to iPhones and let me know my volume level is in a safe place. $250 is a premium price, but I have found them to be worth it.', 'Changed my life, especially nice at work or while doing things around the house. I own an iPhone so the seamless integration between the AirPods and my phone helps a lot. The transparency mode helps to hear things around you, though you cannot have the volume all the way up and expect to hear a conversation. The noise cancelling mode works great also.', 'After plugging these in they only last about 10 minutes before they die. I have only had them for 3 months. I have tried re-installing software, and following all recommended fixes. These are a lemon, and Amazon will not take them as a return as I have had them to long. $200 dollar Airpods should not fail after 3 months with minimal use. Save your money and buy a generic brand as this purchase was super disappointing and painful to loose so much money on an item.  At least if an off brand dies after a few months you wont be out so much money.', 'Pros: Sound quality is great & the noise cancellation works well. The rubber tips make them more comfortable than their predecessors but not by much. Cons: Biggest difference is they use up the battery FAST! Quick to recharge but annoying. Take breaks from them as can be painful if overused. Overall glad I got them but not sure if cost difference from the previous is worth it.', 'I’m giving it 3 stars for sound, but the amount of background noise it picks up on calls is annoying. I have to charge the case every other day, and every few days I have to re-synch with my phone, because they stop pairing. I expected more for the price. I’m wearing a much cheaper, but pretty awesome for the price,  pair of Taotronics earbuds for walks and Audible, because the AirPods battery craps out at about an hour. All in all, meh.', 'I hate the fit. HATE.  And I am an apple lover. I have never been dissatisfied with an apple product until these. I like the normal air pods much better. The noise cancellation is really nice when you want it. Sounds quality is amazing. But they fall out of my ear when talking (or singing). Very not happy with these. I’ve had my entire family try them and no one has said they would buy the pro.', \"For the airpods pro I do enjoy them. They work well with my iphone xs pairing in about 5 seconds. The sound quality is good as well. In my experience the highs seem a little off in pitch with particular music but other wise everything eles is fine. The base is decent but not to punchy.  As for the noise cancellation it is good but not great. I was under the impression and excitement when i got them they would blow me away from what reviews told me here on Amazon. Though various youtubers were mixed and the audiophiles of course said they work fine for what they are and weren't the best.  They fit fine in my ear with medium tips.  After 1 month of lite use as in just a few hours or more a week on average it does a good job. just don't expect to be blown away and its all subjective. It doesn't tune out cars all the way like some people say you can still here them in the background walking next to them or 100 feet away. If you have your volume at 50 perecent it does feel everything is blocked out for the most part but the music is almost to loud for me but again thats preference.  In conclusion if you don't have a spare 250 lying around from Christmas still or tax returns I would just wait to buy them in the future or perhaps wait till a new model comes out.  They work well but wired ones get the job done and noise cancellation isn't required for a good experience, noise cancellation just helps it out.\", 'These are a pleasant surprise in that I can wear them for long periods with absolutely no discomfort whatsoever. Sound is good -- not as good as full over-the-ear headphones and noise cancelling the same -- good but not perfect. I like that the pods connect seamlessly with my iPhone. Amazon asked me to comment on \"moisture wicking\" but I\\'m buggered if I know what that means!', 'I first brought the apple air bud with WiFi and I lost one of them they were amazing! But unfortunately I lost one ☝️. So I decided to get the apple air bud pro. Very disappointed with this purchase they static,  breaking up every time I use them like what the heck these are over two hundred dollars air bud. I don’t know what to do send them back, and get different one or a refund until I make  up my mind, please don’t buy them from Amazon that’s my advice', 'An introverts best friend! I held off (stupid) because they’re hella expensive but I can’t imagine life without them now. The world outside is silent and the sound quality is spectacular. I’ve used them for telehealth at work (I’m a therapist) and clients say the sound is more clear than any other option. I was concerned about them staying in my ears but that’s not remotely an issue. Just get them, seriously.', \"just get the product straight from apple store that makes any issues with the product resolve faster. Do get apple care too, it's cheaper cost when you get it fixed. I don't really know what's the problem with mine, but sometimes it has hard time connecting to my Mac or there's not a strong connectivity whenever I'm watching Youtube from Safari. First few months, I had no issue with it but I had some accidental drops or carpets or mattress at the gym (maybe this is why mine is so jacked up and has problem) but with the price this high?! minor damage shouldn't affect the product where I had to reset mine and connect to my devices again holy crap. Still, noise cancelation is great you won't really hear constant noise , but you will hear loud music coming from outside or any inconsistent noise that are really hard to cancel out. sometimes it noise cancel even if Im on the freaking transparency mode this happens a lot when I just have one AirPod in my ear.  It's worth the money, but still crappy to have minor connectivity issues. buy it from the apple website\", \"These airpods worked well for a few months. Then it started taking longer and longer to pair with my phone. Now, sometimes it takes a couple minutes. Also, super frequently now, the charger doesn't recognize when one of the airpods is docked, and won't charge it, so I have to keep taking it out and putting it back in until it realizes it's in there. The sound has also started randomly breaking up, every now and then. There shouldn't be this many issues after only 7 months.\", 'I was hesitant to spend this amount of money to listen to music at the gym when the pandemic eased up but I was tired of the wire of my previous Bluetooth earphones getting tangled with the elastic of my mask. I am a believer. I bought two additional pairs for my family. My only wish was that ai could adjust the volume on the AirPods rather than having to use my IPhone.', 'These things are da bomb. I resisted buying cause of the price tag, and i have abnormal ear canals (i guess) because ear pods NEVER stay in my ears, or they are so tight it hurts after awhile. Not these! Sound is great, they attached to my ipad and iphone without a problem (unlike the ones i had previously) and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Great battery life.', 'The sound quality is great. Noise cancellation is phenomenal. Unfortunately, they continually fall out of my ears. I have tried all of the different sizes of silicon fittings- none of them stay in worth a darn. They are so expensive that I am afraid to use them unless I am sitting stationary at my desk. For any other use, I go back to my trusty wired headphones. I am very disappointed to have spent so much money on something I am afraid to even use.', 'Update: so I got all of my issues with the AirPods fixed, but now I keep getting ear infections. I’ve deep cleaned them, spent hundreds on doctors bills, and the ear infections keep coming back when I use the AirPods again. I might have to decommission these :( I really really really want to like these air pods,  but they’ve given me so many problems. Every single day I’m having to reset them because one of the headphones isn’t being registered. I’ve done several trouble shooting tips and it might work for a little while, but then I’m back to dealing with the same issues over and over again. I’m contemplating returning them because of how much they were... I shouldn’t be having these many problems and they’re just a pain in the butt at this point.', 'Great sound, nice bass to it, but occasionally disconnects from your apple devices, I have the IPhone 11 Max pro, and it sometimes doesn’t recognize the AirPods?! Which is extremely odd, and it sometimes won’t do the animation to see the battery life, and if you jogging or running it constantly dislodges from ear and you lose the bass sound and have to keep adjusting, and it can’t handle sweating from the ears, not great for working out, but great for just sitting around or chatting on the phone, the distance isn’t to great either, will disconnect if you leave a room, you have to stay near the phone. Will buy the new ones when apple come out with them, hopefully over the ears ones', \"I can't say enough about these airpods. I hesitated, wasn't sure if it was worth the money but let me tell you it's the best thing I ever bought myself. These are GREAT!. Great for music, great for the phone. Instant connect makes receiving phone calls a breeze. and listening to music in noise cancellation is awesome and if I need to hear outside noise while riding my bike the transparency mood is perfect.  Thank you Apple!\", 'I just got these and the sound is wonderful and the noise canceling made this industrial fan sound like a whisper.  Really enjoy the compatibility with my iPhone.  Battery life is only drawback but I don’t need my headphones to last more than 4 hours before throwing them in the case.', \"Works great. The only bad thing is the case can be opened too easily. (the magnet is not strong enough). One time, it drops on the ground, the case opened, the earbud fell out, but the case closed back afterwards. Didn't realize the earbud was out until my wife tried to use it later and found them missing. Luckily, we can found them back.\", 'I have not even had these a month and I’m so frustrated. Most of the time my left one doesn’t pair at all. Now today I can’t even get them to sync with my phone no matter how much I trouble shoot. I sold my regular AirPods to get these pros and I’m so mad that I spent so much money on them and I can’t even enjoy them.', 'These AirPod pros are fine, but nothing to write home about. I was disappointed in the sound quality (I.e. unimpressive bass, and same sound quality as regular AirPods. The transparency and noise cancellation modes are nice features, but I do not think they are worth the additional money compared to regular AirPods. I am particular about good audio quality and should have gotten Marshall’s new earbuds instead of playing it safe with the airpod pros.', \"If I wrote this review a month ago I would have been all about that 5 star rating. I dont' have the original airpods but I was completely blown away by these. After a month or so of use they have become finicky. One will randomly power off and then I need to take them both out, put them in their case for a few minutes and put them back in. Also, some apps will turn off the air pods and and require me to do the same process above. The constant connection problem is becoming annoying and not worth the $250 dollars\", \"Overall good. Do not buy if you think the open case thing will work and auto-connect to your iPhone. The feature is hit or miss. Most times I have to do it multiple times or just open Bluetooth and connect it on the first try manually. Well after a few more months, it's good to know these have more problems. Randomly started just stop playing sound and have to disconnect and reconnect them to the device I was using phone/desktop for sound to play again. These started having issues with the left earbud not connecting/charging, around the 1-year mark.\", 'This item did not work for me but I am not sure it was the fault of the item. I didn’t love the fit. I returned them in March, now I get an email saying that the6 have not received them and the6 are recharging my card!! This is an issue for the kohl’s that I was told to return them to, not me. I would not purchase from this specific seller, maybe? Now I’m in a struggle to get ahold of a real person. I shop Amazon a lot, I mean daily, this is a bummer for my family to not have it.', \"Please re-read that headline. Yes, I have bought 3 NEW Pairs of Airpod Pro's - and ALL 3 have had one of the airpod pros stop charging at some point. These are absolute garbage and I have EVERYTHING Apple. I'm typing this on my macbook pro, while wearing my Apple Watch, with my iPhone in my pocket. This is by far the worst product Apple has ever put out. If i might add - this has ALSO happened to me with the Beats Pro's. Bluetooth and Apple is not ready for prime time. Avoid these at all costs.\", 'Loved these..except they didn’t fit. I have little ears so they didn’t get a good seal to stay in or for noise cancelling. However, when I held them in, the noise cancelling option toggle was super cool. Worked very well! Previously have only had that kind of sound cancellation with over ear headphones. I can only assume they had high quality sound as well but unfortunately wasn’t able to give it a go. Husband tried them on and said they were awesome. He will get a pair soon.', 'BUYER BEWARE!!! After a year the ear tips cracked and fell off and that’s when it was discovered the earbuds are FAKE. Apple replacement tips cannot be fitted on the fake earbuds and the interior underneath the tips are white instead black like authentic AirPod Pros. DO NOT BUY!', 'I tried these for a few weeks, I loved everything about them except they really hurt my ears! It isn’t the little rubber piece it’s the plastic pod itself! The pod presses on my inner ear and isn’t comfortable (I even read the instructions to make sure I was doing it correctly). The noise cancellation was wonderful. I bought them to use for the multiple conference calls I’m on every day for work, but I couldn’t stand to have them in my ears for more than 15 minutes without them getting sore. I decided to return them and buy the original air pods with wireless charging. They’re so much more comfortable! If only they would make the air pods pro with the original ear pod shape.', 'Got this on sale on Amazon right before a trip. Sat across a crying baby on the plane. Popped these bad boys in my ear.

I gave my original AirPods to my daughter and purchased the PRO  They originals kept falling out of my ears. PRO fit more securely.  Sound is terrific. If you are on a lot of conference calls during the day -just remember to wear one -you can hear from individual pods. keep one charged up all times. Rotate ears .For longer battery life.', \"The ear tips didn't seem to fit my ears very well. I had to buy a 3rd party product which is far better than what Apple provided. In addition, the sounds quality is mediocre at best. I own a pair of the original AirPods and the improvement is marginal. The noise-cancelling feature is nice but at first but it hurts my ears after extended use. Finally, they are touchy -I have to adjust them frequently which typically results in accidentally skipping my song or pausing. I'm planning to return them and keep using the gen 1.\", 'AirPods Pro sound great and connects to other iOS devices very nicely. Noice cancellation also works well. The only problem I have is with the wireless charging. I’ve tried 3 different types of wireless chargers and none of them charge the AirPods case correctly. Once placed on the wireless charger, it begins to charge for a few minutes and then randomly stops charging. Yes, I do understand that the charging indicator on the front is supposed to turn off after 8 seconds, that is not what I’m referring to. I open the case and get the pop up on the screen and it shows that the case is no longer charging even though it is well below 100%. Same thing happens on all wireless chargers. This happens regardless of whether there is a silicon sleeve on or not. Everything else is great, I guess I just got a defective product and may have to exchange it.', 'Let me start off by saying that I am an apple fan. Most the computer products I own are apple which pains me to say this about the AirPods Pro. The sound quality is amazing when they stay in. I use these all the time, when I work out, walking around the house or just sitting on my computer. When I work out they are TERRIBLE, they have fallen out numerous amounts of time. You would think its because of sweat however that is not always the case. If I am sitting on the computer I can actually feel them slipping off. I have tried every tip that comes with them and none of them work. Very disappointed with them especially for the price that I paid for the.', 'I’m gonna love these! I sat down and got use to them and got them all figured out in an hour. Very easy to get started with my 12 pro phone. Not totally noise canceling but that’s ok, they have great sound.

Love them!!!!', \"These apple airpods are just off the chart, they sound really good, the noise cancelation is great, build quality is great, everything you'd expect from apple. Always hated the music they play in the gym, and these headphones do a wonderful job at blocking all the noise, while giving great sound quality, i ain't no music professional. But i can for sure recognize good quality from bad one. 6 months later and they still hold as new, battery is decent. Overall i would recommend if you have an apple device,\", 'Purchased as a gift for my wife. These “Pro’s” fit nicely and secured. Noise-canceling and sound quality are beyond exceptional. All these features was why I purchased but wasn’t sure as a gift if I was correct. She did not like regular AirPods due to fit. No doubt now. She absolutely loves them. I have to remember about the noise canceling feature when I ask her something while she’s wearing them. She wears them a lot. Made the right choice as a gift!', 'Here’s the deal. Yes, they are better than AirPods. Yes, they have awesome but not industry leading noise cancellation. And for $199 on sale, they are a reasonable $70 up charge from regular AirPods at $129. But they are less comfortable in the ears for long listening sessions. For first time buyers, go with the Pros. But if you have regular AirPods, don’t bother upgrading.', 'When i first put them on i heard a clicking noise on the left airpod. I noticed this was only when noise cancellation and transparency mode were on. But then in transparency mode i could not hear anything out of the right earbud. Buying airpods from amazon has been stressful. First when buying gen 1’s, I had to replace those. And now these, save your money.', \"This is my second pair.  And both pairs have had the well-documented issue with the Noise Cancellation feature that creates a click or squeaking sound.  It's rather annoying and having to go to the Apple Store and let them deal with it is not the level of quality I've experienced with other Apple products.  I'm looking at other brands.\", \"Amazing! Drowns out white noise well and easy to use. Sound quality is the bomb! Only problem is pairing from one device and it may switch to another. So like when I'm listening to my iPhone music with my AirPods Pro but working on my MacBook Pro laptop, the AirPods sometimes switches to my laptop connections. I think its an Apple issue. I still love them.\", \"I'm clearly one of the only people with a negative review of these, but if you have small ears and have to change to the smaller sized ear cups, be ready to be frustrated.  The replacement cups don't stay on and every time I take them out of my ears, one or both come off.  If I use the medium (standard) size, they work their way out of my ears after 10-15 minutes and will not stay in place. Sound quality and noise cancellation are solid, but if I have to adjust them every few minutes that's not worth it. They also removed features from the previous versions.  That's frustrating.\", 'These are nice, at first. They slowly creep out of my ears, and lose ANC once they creep enough. They also don’t function very well with my work PC. I know, I know, Apple products and PC, I must be nuts. While each bud has a mic, they don’t do well using the left for a while, then transferring to the right so the left can charge, and swapping back again (on PC). This works fine on Apple products. For the price, these should stay put and handle hand-offs better with standard Bluetooth devices. Pretty disappointing', \"I bought these to replace a pair of earphones- I loved dearly- so I could have something else in the apple ecosystem. These are amazing. The sound quality isn't bass boosted, so they are very even sounding. If you looked at an equalizer chart, these would be nearly flat with the way they sound which is great. You can work out in these and they won't come out of you ears at all. The tips feel super light and don't feel like they are there at all. Battery life is good. I have gotten up to 5 hours of use, but in general, you're safer if you just use it for 4. I haven't used noise cancelling mode a lot because I have a pair of overhead earphones but the mode works well in the cases I have used it. My favorite mode is transparency mode. Absolutely incredible and useful. It is the opposite of noise cancelling but you still hear your music. So nice. Overall, great pair of earphones, especially with an iPhone.\", \"My old AirPods 2 was beginning to act up after two years, so I definitely needed a replacement.  I was a little skeptical purchasing these, but I was extremely impressed by the features, especially noise cancellation and spatial audio.  I'm able to hear music and audio significantly clearer.  Highly recommend.\", \"I have a die hard believer that the best sound quality can only come from wired earbuds.  It took me a long time to trust bluetooth buds enough to try them.  I am completely satisfied with these airpod pros.  The noise cancellation is good and the sound quality is up to par.  I have very small ear canals so I have issues with wearing ear buds.  I have the smallest tips on them and I still have trouble keeping them in when workingout.  Its better than others I've used but its doable.\", 'I used to use BOZE or SONY headphones that cover the ears. They got hot and sweaty. I cannot use them to listen to music while walking for exercise. I resisted getting the in-ear phones, thinking that the sound quality must be poorer. To my pleasant surprise the sound quality of the AirPods are just as good. I wish I bought them earlier.', \"I've always bought off-brand bluetooth headphones, and they are usually ok, but the sound quality isn't the best, there's no bass, it allows a lot of outside nice in, die extremely fast, etc. I purchased these, hoping to finally not need a new pair for a long time, and WOW!! The sound is incredible, the bass is really good for bluetooth headphones, and the noise cancellation is insane. You can also switch between noise cancellation and allowing more outside noise in, they're just fantastic. I really love them!\", \"Great sound, pairing, noise cancellation and quality.  The only gripe is as usual with these kinds of ear phones without a wing to help lock them in place, they do fall out from time to time, and if you're on a bike, there's danger there (drains, streams, pot holes, traffic run overs (which happened to my nice expensive bose a few months ago).  Bit overall I'm pleased.  I have a pair of Sonys which stay in place better but the battery life isn't near as good.\", \"I've been using these for a few months and travel quite a bit.  I love everything about the headphones, except for the slightly loose fit and the sound quality.  They sound pretty good when they're pressed hard and deep into my ear, but inevitably they start falling out and the sound quality goes down and they'll even fall out if I don't keep pressing them in.  I tried two sizes, but can't find a good option. Love the rapid connection, using one headphone for calls, and the noise cancelling.\", \"I expected an Apple product to be top rate, and this met my expectations. The sound is clear, and the volume can be adjusted 'just right'. It paired easily with my iphone.  The case plugs in or charges wirelessly.  The buds themselves are recharged from the case, even when it's not near a charger. I find them a little uncomfortable in my ear, but maybe I just need to use a different ear tip.\", 'I have had AirPods for a couple years now and loved them so I did not see the need for an upgrade to the Pros but, I am so happy I finally did! The sound quality is superior, the outside noise control is insanely good, and best of all.. having different size ear pieces so you don’t have to fuss with aftermarket ones you needed with the original AirPods to keep them from falling out of your ears!! Spoil yourself and get AirPod Pro! You will not regret it!', 'the right airpod boasted a clicking, static-noise that sounded like there was constant wind blowing on it. i spent over an hour on the phone with apple as they patiently tried to help me troubleshoot the issue. in the end, nothing could fix it. i ended up returning this pair and ordering directly from apple itself and while it was more expensive and took longer to receive, was way more worth it in the end. i recommend purchasing directly from apple and passing along these.', \"Let me start this by saying that these are 100% the best earbuds i have ever used. For starters, the sound quality is amazing, especially the spacial audio feature. And with the noise cancellation, which works amazingly, i can easily and clearly listen to music. The earbuds themselves are very comfortable, and they fit into my ears easily. Unlike most earbuds i've used, these almost never fall out, and I usually don't have to worry about losing them. Something else i love about these earbuds is the button feature, where you can pinch the bottom of the earbud itself a number of times to do things like pause/play, skip, and toggle noise cancellation and transparency mode. I honestly believe the only reason not to buy these is that they are pretty pricy, but i believe that the price is justified by the amazing features it gives and its amazing quality. probably the last earbuds i will be buying for a while.\", 'An expensive earbud like this and Apple can not include an adapter to charge the Charger in an ordinary wall outlet?  They could have just increase the cost by $3.00.  Almost all wall outlet with USB have a regular USB connector.  This killed the excitement and we have to scramble to buy an adapter before we can used it.  Otherwise we could have rated you much higher.', 'They fall out of my ears.  I had Bose noise cancelling but the little wire would catch them before they fell to the floor or into some where worse.  I would never wear these out of the house due to the fact I would most surely loose them!  So not practical for sports.  Also I have been unable to use them with my Samsung 2011 UN46D6050 so I’m disappointed at lack of versatility, only connects to my apple devices.', \"I bought these after talking with my friend who has a pair, and I won't go back to corded headphones. It's so convenient to listen to music and podcasts at the gym and on my way to class. They don't slip out of my ears while I'm exercising, which is something I was really worried about. But I've ran and weight lifted with them in and they stay put. The noise-canceling feature is also very nice and works well; it blocks out the loud gym music and the noise of people slamming down weights. I like that I can switch between transparency mode and noise-canceling. I have not had any issues with battery life or anything else so far and I've had them for two months, and I'm hoping it stays that way. I would recommend buying the Airpod Pros if you're debating. I spent a month doing research and going back and forth on whether they were worth the money. I personally feel that I have already got my money's worth with them, and I'm glad I went through with my decision to purchase.\", 'My husband got me these for Christmas and I’m so excited! I’ve always preferred in-ear earbuds as opposed to the apple earbuds design. BUT... they don’t fit. My ears usually use the small attachment. These smalls slide right out. The mediums slide out slowly, but still fall out. The largest slide out, but catch so they don’t fall out of my ears. I can’t decide if I want to keep them. So bummed.', 'This was the worst Apple product I\\'ve purchased. Gen1 AirPods where much more refined.  The sound quality is ok, nothing to write home about. Two of the AirPods I had came in scuffed from the box! Had issues adjusting a volume. Bad experience overall. P.S. According to Fakespot website there is a great deal of fake reviews \"Our engine has profiled the reviewer patterns and has determined that there is high deception involved\".', 'Normal hard bud AirPods do not fit in my ears, they fall out and they give me headaches. I wasn’t sure how good the air pods pros were gonna be but they work great!! minimal problems with falling out and it comes with great features. the noise cancellation isn’t as good on mine as some other peoples but it still works fine. if you don’t care about having to reconnect your wireless ear buds or having any noise cancellation then i wouldn’t buy these. Really the only special thing about it and it’s very expensive. I personally enjoy these though. Mine came with the AirPods, the charging case, a charger, and different size ear buds.', 'I own multiple wireless ear buds and headphones (Apple, Bose, Sony, etc) and the Apple AirPods Pro are nothing special. The AirPods Pro are small and light weight, which is convenient. However, IMO, the sound from my BOSE wireless buds is better and my Bose wireless over the ear headphones are even better. If you want to be recognized as part of the “in crowd” then buy the Apple buds. If, on the other hand, you want better sound, buy Bose.', \"Sound and call quality are nothing special. Noise cancelation works great, battery life is reasonable but not that long. I bought a one described as used - like new, with a description stating that the original packaging was damaged. However, the product I received was clearly used, scratched up, and covered in ear wax and hair so I'm writing this review to complain about that.\", 'When my old airpods (which I have had for a couple of years) started to fail, I ordered these. I just got them today and I’m already glad I went for the extra bucks to get the Airpods Pro. The noise cancellation is really good - especially important because I work from home now, and I live in a rather noisy building. The rubber tips make these feel more secure than the original design - and I’m glad they include multiple sizes of tips to choose from. Good investment in my sanity!', \"I was hesitant about getting the earbuds because I am constantly losing things, but I also wanted to be able go for walks with out a cord dangling near my arms.  The sound quality of these air buds is great and the noise cancellation is exceptional, although I don't use it when out on walks.  They charge up quickly and hold a charge for a long time - or I've been able to binge watch a season of a show without having to recharge them.  Highly recommend these air pod pro.\", \"The sound is great. The 3-way noise management is great, especially the noise dampening setting. I don't know if it's because of the size/shape of my ears, but the pods (both left and right) have loosened and fallen out/off multiple times. Talking, moving, especially eating seems to encourage it. Never had this problem with the original cheaper AirPods. Though these new ones are more comfortable.\", 'I like these AirPods a lot. Sound quality is great, fit is exceptional and noise cancelling is great. I have no complaints with these and still believe these are the best product Apple has ever made, especially if you’re an iPhone user. These sync so effortlessly between Apple devices it’s almost magic. I would buy these again and again.', 'Leave it to Apple to take a good product and make worse (and charge you more).  My wife thought she would upgrade my AirPods with a gift to AirPods Pro.  Apple provides multiple removeable ear inserts with the Pro.  I tried them all and the AirPods fall out frequently while walking.  The sounds quality is not as good either.  I gave up and went back to the original AirPod one size fits all and done with the Pro.', 'I waited probably 6 months to buy these and I wish I did it sooner. Audio quality is amazing, they fit well, they work perfect with Siri, I love the feature where they stop playing when you take them out and start again when you put them back in… just a great experience all around. They feel very much worth the price tag. The only complaint I have is the battery life. While they don’t take long to charge, they don’t take long to die. Maybe I’m spoiled with some other headphones I’ve had (much cheaper too), but a few hours isn’t long enough for me. I like going for long hikes and just wearing them most of the day in general. They require a couple charges for me a day. Maybe that’s Apple being Apple, leaving you wanting more, but yeah, mildly frustrating. Still buy these. They’ll make you a happier person.', 'So much better than the regular AirPods! For the longest time i was having a hard time justifying the price of these AirPods Pro, but i finally gave in and purchased then, and i don’t regret it one bit. They’ve got a longer battery life, they’re noise cancelling. You can also set them to a “transparency” setting where you can clearly hear when others are talking to you. I love them!', '1. Case 2. Left earbud 3. Right earbud The case and the box serial numbers the same and recognized by apple coverage. Both earbuds’ serial numbers are not recognized by apple coverage. Is this normal?', 'I held back from getting AirPods for so long. I work by myself for the most part so I’m wearing headphones all day. I’ve had everything from $30-$300, buds, around the neck, wired, over ear.... these air the best as far as comfort and noise cancellation. Sounds amazing for buds. I think sounds is better on my Sony WF-1000XM3’s but the Sony’s stick out and would constantly fall out. The only thing I’d the battery’s don’t last as long on the AirPods. But they charge crazy fast.', 'Really good earbud, the only issue I have is the fit in my ear. Sometimes if I move too much it will fall (around once every two weeks from daily use). I tried all the 3 sizes and none really fit my ear perfectly. I like to put them on at night when I sleep because people I live with snores and I find it out of my ear when I wake up almost every day. The noise cancellation and battery life are really good. Awesome purchase that I will be using for years to come.', 'Like all Apple products this works wonderfully right out of the box. Sound is a good as I would expect. Spatial sound is very nice. I use these to listen to my tv which links with my Apple TV as soon as I insert them in my ears. I gave it four stars because I was not able to change out the silicon ear size adapters.', 'I got these as a gift for my husband for the holidays. He had the original AirPods and they were slowly dying - fritzing out, losing charge quickly, taking too long to charge... These were 100% worth the upgrade. His job requires him to listen to music A LOT - so he needs something that holds a charge, charges quickly, and works consistently. He also said that the noise cancelation was 100 x better!', 'Cannot recommend these enough. If you’re debating between these and the originals - the pros are so worth it. The noise cancelation is life changing. It’s very impressive how good the noise cancellation is for such a small product! I wear them everyday. They charge super fast. I wouldn’t be super eager to recommend these to a long distance runner as they aren’t the *best* at staying in your ears for a long period of time but I wear them to the gym when I do a couple mile run & only have to adjust them once or twice. Other than that for walking around & lifting I’ve never had issues.', 'I have both the Powerbeats Pro for running and the AirPods Pro for day to day. The AirPods Pro do a good job at noise cancellation and are nice and small, but I miss the Powerbeats’ easy volume control. Siri is just not convenient for this. Please join me and file a feature request on Apple’s website to implement long press on the left AirPod for volume down and long press on the right AirPod for volume up.', 'Long time AirPods user, I upgraded to the pros. The noise canceling is great, and transparency mode is ideal for walking on the street. The spatial audio is honestly magical with the apps it works in (Disney+ and AppleTV especially). Minus one star because the silicone tips it comes with hurt my ear canal and I had some chaffing after extended use. I got some Comply foam tips and they are way more comfortable.', 'I wish I tried these sooner. They are amazing!!! The sound is clear. Noise canceling works like magic. They are perfectly crafted and comfortable to wear. Easy to store. Have made my endless virtual meetings easier to attend. My staff can hear me clearly as I operate completely phone free. Thank you Apple for creating these genius earbuds and Amazon for the sale price!', 'Well these fall out of my ears - some needs to make a device to hold them in.  Gave them to my side fits her ears just fine.  Surprised with all the engineering talent at Apple they do not offer a design that allows for a greater diversity of ear shapes and ear canals.', 'I don’t normally like stuff in my ear like this but these are really comfortable. Some people complain about the length but I think the length is perfect. The upgrade force touch is a must and I can’t live without it. I work on a farm and near loud equipment a lot and I really like these to listen to podcasts while I bush hog or anything like that. I can hear a little bit of the sound but the noise cancelling is very efficient for such a small compact ear bud. It literally is so fun putting them in. I’m not one to jump on band wagons, but these are great.', 'I’ve had these for around 2 years now and have experienced constant issues around the right AirPod not connecting. I’ve followed all of the recommended troubleshooting steps but still this product does not work. I’ve had it replaced once and the issue still did not resolve. Apple has not supported this product well in the calls I’ve had with them so in terms of reliability I’d recommend avoiding these and going with some other product. Also, in terms of quality, these don’t sound all that great.', 'Sound and noise cancel are fine, like any other device these days. The battery in the left ear keeps dying way too fast (approx. 20 mins) while the right is still at 70%. Not sure what the deal is but unsatisfied with that for sure!', 'Was excited to finally get my hands on the Pro AirPods after using the Original ones for years. What a terrible mistake. Right off the bat, the sound quality is AWFUL. There’s a really weird mix between highs, mids, and bass. Seriously, the quality is just bizarre and for $200+ headphones I’m shocked that anyone seems to think this sound quality is acceptable from Apple. I also find the Pros to be super uncomfortable compared to the originals. Yes, I’ve tried the different fits. They’re all uncomfortable. Overall, do yourself a favor and stick with the Original ones.', 'If you own an iPhone then you know nothing beats the quality and fast connection than AirPods. Battery last as advertised. I’ve been using them for a while. Noice cancellation is great. I really like the auto noise cancellation function. Sound quality is good. Transparent mode is great especially if you’re walking or biking outside so you can hear the other noises. I definitely recommend this.', \"I went back and forth between getting myself these or the regular Airpods. Luckily due to Black Friday, the Pro's were available at a great price. These in my opinion are worth the extra money, definitely worth their full price. I am so glad I splurged on these ones, the fit my ear great, battery for case and pods lasts a long time. They're amazing. I am flying internationally soon and can't wait to use these for the plane.\", \"I've various noise cancelling headphones. I've also had a couple of pairs of the original Airpods, with which I've been very pleased. The addition of noise cancelling meant high expectations for the AirPodsPro. And they haven't disappointed...much. The sound is great with the noise cancelling enabled. The only negative is that they max out on 5 hours of wireless/noise cancelling use. I take a lot of long (12+ hours) flights so that's a bit of a bummer. Can still heartily recommend them.\", 'I already had the 1st generation Air Pods and was very happy with them.  Used them mainly for tele and video conferencing.  I decided to purchase the Air Pod Pros for their additional noise canceling feature to use while flying. These worked great for that purpose. I have the wired over the ear and in-ear Bose noise canceling earphones that I previously used for flying and they worked great too. But the wireless Air Pod Pros are so much more convenient. I’m very happy with the sound quality and much improved bass response, battery life, and, of course, the noise cancellation. And now with the spatial audio features, I can enjoy my Dolby Atmos movies at volume at night on my big screen through Apple TV without bothering anyone else in the house.', 'These air pods are fantastic, I mowed my lawn with them on the other day and could barley hear the lawn mower. Battery life is good, sound is great, They only thing I would change is the cord that comes with them is the old cord that no longer fits with my I phone 7. Need to update that but otherwise very happy with my purchase.', \"If you're an Apple device owner, particularly an iPhone, these are a no-brainer. The premium pricing is well worth purchasing over the standard Airpods. Go for the Pro. The noise cancelling features are outstanding. Even on a crowded subway, the noise cancelling can block out most exterior noise, which exceeded my expectations. Very easy to pair with any Apple device you may have from iPhone, iPad, or even Macbook. These are also the most comfortable wireless earbuds I have tried. Battery life when listening to music is around four hours for me. These also work great when on conference calls for hands-free talk. These have been a huge help when working at home. It is pricey, but the value matches the high quality of the product.\", 'I love these. I was nervous to buy them cuz I was afraid to lose them as they are small and my ears tend to not hold headphones well. They usually either hurt my ears or just plain fall out for no reason. But these stay in place nicely, I can wear them for hours and they don’t hurt my ears as much. They sound great, the noise cancelling is really cool to turn off and on. I haven’t really found anything I don’t like about these. I do think my ears get tired and it can make the insides itchy and irritated after a good 6 hour use, but that’s my ears, I don’t think any headphone is intended to be used consecutively that long.', 'These AirPods are great in every way possible I’m just extremely disappointed with the fact they came missing a part in one of them', \"I liked these until I found out the batteries only last about 3-4 hours... so much for uninterrupted workflow. Even worse, the low battery alert tone is SUPER LOUD. It is painful and startling to say the least. I've checked every forum and tried all the suggestions—there is no way to fix this issue. AirPods alert volume is stuck on super loud unless they can fix it in an update. It's doubtful that they'll do this since their response in forums is pretty non-existent.\", 'There have been many complaints about these not fitting well and/or being uncomfortable, which can be understandable depending on the individual.  However, I love ‘em! When the AirPods came out, I was excited but reluctant to purchase due to the loose fit.  When I saw the AirPods Pro, EXCITEMENT!!!  I do wish they could be slightly louder.  Let’s just say if you don’t have a problem with the ear buds sitting in the ear canal, you’ll appreciate these as much as I do!', 'So disappointed. Waited forever to allow myself to buy the Apple ear pod pros. They seem a better price now so I gave in. Only I can’t listen to music and make calls because of the CHARGER! Why oh why did they do this to meeeeeeee!!!!! 🧐. I can’t say how it sounds because I can’t use it! Ughghhhh. I should have dig deeper into the reviews but who knew the charger would be an issue! Ughhhhhhh Returning', 'Overall they are great, and for $200 they should be. Two complaints- the controls on the ear pods and the fit in my ears. How is it that Apple can’t make a headphone that fits my ears?  I have $9 ear buds that fit great. Since I do have to adjust these ear pods I then cause them to change noise cancelling or go to next in playlist. This is stupid. There should be a way to lockout the controls so you can adjust the EarPods!', 'I was so excited about my new noise cancelling headphones but they hurt my ears and won’t stay in (almost lost one because it fell out walking down stairs). Also, I’m not sure how Apple expects you to charge them. My “old” phone chargers don’t charge them and the cord that came with it is useless unless you have a newer Apple product. Disappointed overall. The sound quality is great but a useless product. They’ve died and now I can’t use them anymore since I can’t charge them.', \"I liked these AirPods pros, what I didn't like is defective charging and restocking fee for a defective unit.  The first airppod pro stopped charging after a couple months but was intermittent prior to that.  The replacement unit charged the AirPods but would not charge the case.  When they were returned I was charged a $35.83 restocking fee for a defective product.  Do not buy these.\", 'Love everything they bring to the table. If you use the right size ear tips they will fit snug. I run on weekends and they never fall out. The audio quality is crazy good. Not audiophile good, but not too shabby. The bass is deep and present. The dynamic audio between the two buds creates an insane depth of illusion where I sometimes truly cannot tell if the music I’m listening to is from the AirPod Pros or something around me. They can get quite loud, and if you have noise cancellation on you can get really loud without ever going over half volume (it’s harder to “hear” the volume when ambient environment noises conflict, thus requiring you to turn your volume up louder without noise cancellation) The noise cancellation if you’ve never experienced it before is startlingly good. If you have experienced noise canceling before, it’s startlingly good! I commute via public bus daily and usually sit next to the engine in the back. The AirPods pros can’t manage to mask the engine’s entire hum purely by noise cancellation, but if you have music playing you will forget the engine is even there. The battery for most people will not be an issue given that you put them in the case intermittently. Now I use the AirPod pros mainly with new apple products but also have used them with android. Simply put, the connectivity is much more fluid with an apple product. The H1 chip and Bluetooth v5 on the AirPods and device make for a much better experience than I anticipated. The only issue I have is that when taking one AirPod out (this is supposed to stop audio) it will stop but then flicker the audio between on and off. This isn’t really a big con but just to say that the connectivity is not flawless. The price is the only real con here, but if you want in-ear true wireless noise canceling buds then there’s little to compete with these in the market. Samsung does have a noteworthy rival, though their connectivity is not as convenient as the AirPod Pros (especially for apple users).', \"Should've stayed with the regular ones. Won't stay in the ear even though they fit bit difficult to operate. Too late to send back so just stuck with them. I don't recommend them and would not buy again. Will be ordering a pair of the regular ones.\", 'I would never spend 200 dollars on these. I had rewards points from my amazon card and said what the hell. That being said... they are incredible with the iPhone. Definitely the best Bluetooth buds you can get if you have an iPhone. Normally I listen to music through beyerdynamic dt-880. These are not those nor should anyone expect audiophile quality from headphones like these. The sound quality is really good though. If you are used to regular consumer headsets and buds, the AirPods Pro will blow you away. Also, a side note... everyone has active noise cancelling these days. Where these really shine, is with the transparency mode. No other Bluetooth headphones do that as well as these as far as I am aware.', 'Definitely worth the money.  The sound quality and noise cancellation on these are both great.  My only complaint is the earbud tips are not comfortable for me.  I found Comply Foam Earbud Tips and bought them through Amazon as well and that fixed this problem.  Additionally, with the Comply tips, they stay put much better.  I recommend the AirPods Pro and the comply tips to make them perfect.', \"The thing that I like about the airPods pro is the sound  and the noise canceling features. But what I dislike  is that it doesn't stay in my ear as will as the regular airPods even though I try the different ear pieces they supply. So if you want to use it while running you will always have be fighting with it in your ear.\", 'I love these! I never understood why they were so expensive so I never thought to purchase them before. I needed better headphones for all of the remote work I’ve been doing and I am absolutely obsessed and use them for so much more than work calls. The sound quality is better than the 3 pairs of Bose headphones I’ve had over the years. The noise canceling is super high. My only complaint with these is that I don’t love the way it sounds without the noise cancelling enabled so I use it whenever I am using the headphones. They are much more comfortable than the over ears headphones I was using before and I’ve been wearing them for 9 hours a day. I’m worried I’ll lose them since they’re so small but will surely purchase a new pair if do.', 'I just got them yesterday, but so far they are great! Noise cancellation is amazing. I could see my hubbys lips moving and I literally thought he was screwing with me, but he was actually yelling and I couldn’t hear a sound. And being able to switch between that and Transparency mode is exactly what I need. I have several zoom meetings a week and I’m usually walk i around my site while on them (when I can get away with no video🤣) so I’m excited to try them out. They are exactly what the description said they would be. As of right now I highly recommend considering them. If I have any problems in the future I’ll write a review  about that as well. But for now I’m extremely happy. Great price. The Apple care. Quick delivery.', \"I am a long-time very happy user of Apple products and recently switched from Apple AirPods to the AirPods Pro. The sound is wonderful and the noise-cancelling feature works very well. However, they do NOT stay in your ears. My old AirPods never fell out while working out or running or anything. The AirPods Pro fall out while working out ... because it's winter I haven't tried running with them yet, and I probably won't for fear of them falling out and losing them in the snow. This is a serious design flaw that Apple should fix. I probably should have done more research before making the switch but didn't imagine Apple selling a product that was designed so poorly. So ... if you plan to sit still while wearing the AirPods Pro ... then they're fine. But if you want to be active ... don't buy them. I had to purchase a 3rd party product to get them to stay in my ears. Shouldn't have to spend more money do make them do what they should, by default, do ... stay in my ear!\", \"Now that I'm working from home during quarantine, I've become sick of being tethered to my laptop with a CORDED headset.  I wanted something different and the hard ear buds hurt my ears after some time.  These allow a more comfortable use without a cord.  I can walk all around my house and listen/speak during a call without having to take my laptop with me.  It even allows me to get more steps in while still being able to continue working (BONUS)!\", 'Worst but I’ve made. First the left ear quit working for Noice Cancellation. Then it came back and now the right one doesn’t hold a charge for mote than 1hr. Amazon are liars and their 90 day replacement guarantee is a lie. I have it documented. I contact them for service and get rerouted to Apple where it cost me $100 to send in one ear pod to have it replaced. This equipment and support are trash. Amazon is kore worried about profits than customers and it shows. Do not buy Apple Products through Amazon or you’ll regret it.', 'AirPods Pro are amazing. Nevermind the sound quality- which is excellent- the noise-canceling alone is worth it. Just to hear silence (or close to it) is a relief. The original AirPods were excellent for what they were, but these are a completely different product and essential for anyone who loves to listen to music and podcasts, but also craves silence- or at least, as close to silence as we can get these days.', 'I love these!!! Still have to get use to how they work apart from just playing sound. When I’m in a phone call and have to adjust or take them out, I’ve lost the call. My ears are small so sometimes they slowly ease out of my ear over time if I don’t put them in right. And the other thing is switching the noise cancellation on and off. Sometimes they’re so sensitive to the touch and it works, and other times it doesn’t. Sounds like a lot of issues, but I really do like them. The noise cancellation part is pretty amazing. Especially on an airplane. :)', 'I got the pros because the other ones wont stay in my ears. They just pop right out. Even when just walking around. Maybe i have defective ear holes lol. But the pros stay in my ear during more normal activities like doing stuff around the house or walking around. The “noise cancelation” is an absolute joke. They muffle sound for sure and it makes it easier to watch stuff while im not doing anything at work, but it far faaaar faaaaaaaar from cancels noise lol thats laughable. They are solid head phones with great battery life though and thats what i was looking for. They should be about 1/4th to 1/2 the price they are though. I would recommend them but i would discourage buying them either.', \"When these Apple AirPods Pro came up at he discounted price, I was very skeptical.  I figured they're fake.  I contacted Apple support and they couldn't believe either.  I gave the ASIN # and the person at Apple was amazed but skeptical.  I took a chance and THOSE ARE REAL.  I bought 2.  Absolutely awesome.\", 'None of the sizes of ear plug they provide (3) fit my ear. Every couple of minutes I have to adjust the plug so that it doesn’t fall out of my ear. This isn’t an issue I had with the standard AirPods but is constant with my pros. And there’s no base in them, at all. The noise cancelling is surprisingly good however, when the earbud slip out of your ear even slightly, which is does constantly for me, the noise canceling is turned off and it automatically goes into transparency mode which amplifies all the sounds around you. And the battery life is atrocious. My standard AirPods last all night and into the following day the pros maybe last 4 hours. So not even a full shift. Luckily they charge pretty fast.', \"First of all the sound is amazing and I love the transparency mode. However for $200 these should be dual Bluetooth capable. It's a pain in my ass to have to switch between both of my phones when my Blue Parrot is capable of dual connection. Occasionally I get weird static in my right ear and have to put them back in the case and reset them. Also they unexpectedly go dead if you don't charge them perfectly. If you're looking for great headphones to listen to music to these are it. But if you're using them for business calls Etc three and a half four stars.\", \"I will never buy headphones again from Apple.  One month after purchase, the left piece came to complete death. I had to go to an authorized retail store to replace it. I got a replacement. Many months later, apple announced a problem in noise for Airpods sold during certain time frame that include both of my pieces. You have to go a retail store where an employee tests your Airpods and decides if you are eligible for replacement or not. I lost one piece before I manage to visit a store. Overall, I wouldn't pay $250 for such a experience with this product.\", 'We have a number of AirPods and AirPod pros, they keep going in for service, one or both will stop working, my son’s latest issue is they have to be positioned angled up to get sound. The AirPod pros we bought in may 2020, just died, and service won’t repair because we are out of warranty. Meanwhile my wife’s beats are still working.', \"Perfect fit.... I wanted an upgrade and purchase the Beats EarPods from Apple and they hurt my ears :-(.  They also didn't sound as good as my original Apple Ear-pods ( which still works) but I wanted a backup pair, so I decided to purchase the Pro and I'm so glad did. Thank you for your quick service and most of all the great price :-)\", 'I’ve only had these for a little over a month now and the left earbud now sounds like a blown speaker... it’s very disappointing I bought these to work out with and expected better quality for the price...', 'This is my first review ever on a product. I am not an extremely tech savvy individual who can review minute details about the technical features of the air pods but what I can tell you as an avid music lover , is that I waited too long to get my hands on the air pods. Ever since I’ve used them quality of my music listening experience has grown exponentially. The noise cancellation feature brings complete focus on what you are listening to and you’d be transported to that world. I would highly recommend the air pods.', 'I expected better sound quality at least .. The sound quality reminds me of them 99cent earphones.. even $30-50$ generic Bluetooth earphone sounds better.. I’m only keeping this because generics one I bought one side keeps dying so I’m hoping by paying the extra cash for quality it’ll last a whole lot longer.. the noise cancellation was amazing.. i opened then placed in my ear and boom quiet.. I wasn’t even connect to Bluetooth and that threw me off the noise canceling is 5 star..  what kills me the most is the sound quality.. $200 for some bad sound quality awesome noise canceling Bluetooth earphone lol Been using it for couple months and one thing I hate about it is that there’s no on on/off button and it’s constantly still on which if I don’t use it for a while/charge it I come back to some dead EarPods.. it shouldn’t be worth $200', 'These are a waste of money. My regular Apple earbuds are 100% better than these. These \"Pros\" constantly cut out, have error messages and sometimes one of the earbuds doesn\\'t work at all, so sound only comes out of one of them. Hardly ideal. I would return them but apparently, I just missed the window. Very dissatisfied.', 'Not happy with these at all. They constantly fall out of my ears.  The volume doesn’t seem to go very high. I’ve used them mostly with my Peloton and there is a big difference in the sound quality of these versus my old AirPods. At the same Volume level the new ones can barely be heard. I’ve tried to fix on my phone but doesn’t seem to change.  I personally do not recommend.', 'The city is noisy EVERYWHERE you go. Motorcycles, car horns, car alarms, music, boom boxes, inconsiderate upstairs neighbors allowing children to run and jump off furniture- it never ever stops. I need some peace and quiet every day. Even on the subway ride home - loud noise. These EarPods dull the noise. I hear nothing, the sound quality is excellent. I never have an issue with battery life because I charge them every other day.', \"These are definitely an improvement over the regular air pods but the improvement in sound isn't nearly as great as I was expecting.  I feel they sound marginally better than the regular air pods, but a step down from the superior and cheaper competitors.  The noise cancelling on the other hand is better than expected.  Wearing these at the gym last night almost drowned our everything, making for a somewhat silent workout.  It's a far different experience from the normal air pods and really the main reason I bought these over something like the beats version.  I also had some problems with fit, as they would start to slip out a few times during a 30 min run.  The original air pods, especially with aftermarket hooks, stayed in my ears more securely.\", 'These are spectacular and when accompanied with foam earplug replacements fit my ears perfectly. I found the factory rubber earplugs fell out when I worked out. Far superior to the standard apple earbuds but the sound is not superb if you were hoping to use them for watching late night movies and not wake up the family. The sound Imaging feels like it comes from behind your head just above the shoulder line. I have tried quite a few headphones from low end to the high end units and feel like these are in the middle. I’m a bit of an audiophile and love listening to my Sound system but I was hoping to avoid the inevitable turn that down by using my new headphones. These are not even close to a decent sound system and watching movies on them is just...ok. The convenience factor makes for a great tool for talking on the phone and being mobile which is why I gave it high review stars. Let’s face it for the price you can hardly get a decent set of  interconnects so I can’t really complain. I do wish a truly immersive Dolby Atmos experience could be had with these headphones but that would likely come in the future.', 'These are solid truly wireless earbuds. The sound quality is better than the standard AirPods in both ANC and ambient modes. The battery life is a little low but that’s to be expected with how small these are. The ANC works very well and there little to no in ear pressure from it. I own a pair of high end sony anc headphones and find myself using these more as they are lighter and don’t make my ears hot. It maybe my ears but they do become slightly uncomfortable after extended use but not as bad as other wireless earbuds I’ve tried.', 'Apple makes great products and the airpods have a wonderful listening quality. The only negative thing I will say is that the left airpod stopped working a little over a year of regular use. This was a little disappointing, but from what I understand from the technician, is that this an issue with some of these models. You can just order a single airpod, for a fee of course, and go back to enjoying the product.', \"These simply will not stay in ears.  I've read that Apple tests show 90 percent of customers have no issues with it, guess I'm in the 10 percent.  Doesn't matter what size tips i use, the slip, slide and fall out.  There are numerous fixes listed on web including purchasing add ons like memory foam tips or different silicone tips, but at the high premium price, i just don't think i should drop another 15-25 to make them work.  I'll stick with the Alexa buds i already have and pre-order the new ones.\", 'They do not fit super snuggly in your ear no matter what size rubber thing you use. Not super great for running or working out if they tend to fall out pretty easily. With that being said they are actually a pretty good product. The sound is absolutely amazing and the noise cancellation is pretty cool! If you were watching a movie with these the special Oreo really makes it sound like the characters are right in the room with you! They are worth the price but if you were looking for an earbud to work out with maybe this one isn’t  for you.', 'These are so nice. I love not being tied to my devices by cables and with an 8 month old constantly in my arms they are so convenient! I have had a couple hiccups with devices that aren’t apple or with certain applications, like Go To Meeting where I will disconnect them on purpose and successfully and then have no sound from my device. Other than that they are pretty much perfect! They are a great splurge!', 'This product will not stay in your ears. At the gym this earphone consistently falls, and I have to stop sets to pick up the headphone to place in my ear. I am so sick and tired of this product. I can not understand why apple would develop a product that will not stay in your ear. This headset is for administration work, and desk duties, not designed for gym goes and construction.', 'I purchased these hoping I’d be able to use them for work and working out but that’s not the case.  They work fine if you’re not moving along but they do work themselves free and fall out.  I’ve tried all three different ear tips and none solve the problem.  I cannot use them for running or other high movement activities for fear of them falling out or getting lost. That said, the noise cancellation is nice and they’re good quality. 2 stars because I had hoped they’d stay in place MUCH better than they actually do.  For that, I am disappointed in the purchase.', \"I am an avid user of airpods whether it be the gym at work or simply around the house. These things are great quick connectivity better sound and even better hearing when not playing anything through the headphone but noise cancelling when playing music. Apple has made a great product with these and they feel more comfortable than ever in ear, my mom didn't like the feel of the first gen airpods so she gave hers away but shes considering getting these because she likes the feel of mine.\", 'Product is fine except that I can not get a good fit/seal in my right ear. I have tried all three tip sizes and fiddled with positioning. If you Google this issue, you will see that this seems to be a common problem with no resolution. It negates the benefit of the noise cancellation feature which we paid for. Some customers have suggested tips of different diameter and/or length are needed.', 'All the features are great considering its still a fairly new concept and since apple is trying to incorporate a lot. BUT unless youre just going to study with them, DONT bother these started to malfunction after just 7 months. My left earbud and the charging case wont connect 90% of the time so im left using only one bud to workout with. My guess is that a little sweat or moisture of some kind got into the charger.', 'I like the ease where they work automatically when you put them on. The transparency and noise cancellation works very well.  The battery lasts for a long time and the case recharges them until the case needs recharging. The sound quality is excellent, comparing it to my Bose over the ear headphones. Plus I can use the AirPods for phone calls, Zoom meetings, as well as music.', 'I have no idea why people like this device unless I got fake earphones. The Airpods Pro that I received had a terrible chemical stink. Looking online it looks like some others had the same problem. I had ringing in my ears after 2 hours of wearing this. I found the device uncomfortable, noise cancellation was subpar. Did I receive a fake ?', 'I bought these for my best friend, did a extensive research, reviews look good and I never had a problem before with buying Apple store products on Amazon. After giving him the gift, I unwrapped the plastic and I setup the Air Pods to his phone. He put air pods in his ears and played a song. He said the left one was broken. I couldn’t believe it. We took it to an actual Apple Store. Through troubleshooting, they found the air pods were used but still under warranty. Now I have to send back through UPS to receive a new pair. RIDICULOUS!!!', 'I love that these come with different size silicon ear plugs. I can not wear the original ones with the oval ear piece. These fit snug and cancel outside noises very well. Plus, you can turn off noise cancellation to hear the outside world to better hear people speaking. The sound quality is great! And I can watch action movies without disturbing anyone else. They are totally portable too.', 'I’m a strong believer that wired headphones will always be better than wireless. I mean, you are quite literally sacrificing quality for convenience. So, picking up the AirPods Pro, I expected to be neutral at best. Fast forward a couple months, it’s literally all I use with my iPhone. Wired still sounds better and has a much better microphone (The AirPods microphone is complete garbage), but the convenience factor is a lot more important than I anticipated. It’s just SO easy to throw them in and out. Noise cancelling isn’t anything too great but the battery life is solid and they’re pretty comfortable. Definitely some downsides but it’s just so convenient. No cable occupying the charging port or getting caught on door handles. There is no reason not to have a pair if you own an iPhone.', 'I have been using various earbuds since 1984 on a Sony cassette walkman and FINALLY someone has engineered proper, modern, usable headphones that sound great, keep you safe , block out noise and protect your hearing all at the same time. The noise canceling is great, sound quality is more than adequate, call quality is suberb. Best of all you can walk or ride a bike in public and be fully aware of what is going on around you and listen to tunes at the same time.  A major hit from Apple.', 'I have other bluetooth headphones that are fine. But these, for some reason, caused intense headaches when I wore them. If you are sensitive, beware.  I chose instead to just use some really nice corded headphones (and sound quality will always be better off bluetooth, as the sound files have to be compressed to be sent wirelessly)', \"I was apprehensive about making this purchase as these are a bit pricey. But, I'm really glad I did make the purchase. The AirPods Pro have incredible noise cancellation and the sound quality is stunning. I love the wireless charging feature. The ease of use makes them even more desirable. Like other reviewers, I agree that they do look a bit silly. Perhaps Apple will eventually develop a more concealed version of AirPods in the future.\", 'Exactly what you’d expect from Apple. There are enough reviews about them, read them. What I want you all to know about mine is, after one day of about 2 hours of use, the right one stopped working. I did all the resets. Charged it by itself. Tried it in the other ear. Every thing my feeble mind could think of, no joy. I do, however, love them enough that I am exchanging for a new pair. I’ll update...', 'My mom got these for me for my birthday, and they are perfect. I can go to the gym, and not hear anything around me as I focus on my workout and music. Noise cancelling is very impressive, as well as sound quality. I am able to wear them and forget that they are even there! These are very perfect, and I use the small rubber piece. They last me about 4 hours with noise cancelling and music, sound. Then I put them in the case for 2 minutes, and I have another 2 hours of playtime. Only flaw is they’re a little bit buggy with windows, but a quick change the bluetooth settings fixes everything! overall great product. I have mine with a nice looking naruto case.', 'Got these for a great Amazon price. Wow. I tried and shopped and looked around everywhere. Nothing beats these. Yes, you get what you pay for. This is top notch. I tried lower end earbuds and I can hear every step when running. These are amazing. Then when you want to tune the world out, the noise cancelling function is spectacular. You need these Air Pods Pro in your life.', 'They need more ear tips, tree tips. I’ve tried and purchased everything available and want the wireless earbuds to work, but doubt they will at this point and I’ll have to tell selling them and take a loss. As soon as I put them in my ears I can smile and feel them working there way out. No way at all I could workout in them the way they are. Disappointing.', 'Si quieres comprar unos audífonos inalámbricos te puedo asegurar que en lo de comodidad los AirPods pro son fatales todo el tiempo se salen del oído primer producto de apple que me párese súper incomodo . La calidad es indescutible. Esto lo lo estoy agregando una semana después que creen me termine adaptando alos AirPods pro y estoy encantado y ya no páresen incomodos .estube muy seria de devolverlos pero les quice dar un chanse y funciono y ahora estoy muy feliz cons estos audífonos y acepto soy un fanboy de apple 😏', 'As always Apple products are the BEST ! I find these AirPods to be very comfortable they come with three size ear tips so I do not understand when people say it hurts their ears more ons. You will not be disappointed with the quality of apples products especially these AirPods the bass the treble the mids are all there. I could truly say I am as happy as phuc right now !', 'If you want to have something that just works perfectly with your Apple ecosystem and don’t like the constant noise you might hear from your AC or fan in your room them this will alleviate the problem for you. These would be great on a plane but at the time of this review I’m not flying anywhere anytime soon. Sound quality is good considering they are still in ear headphones. The pairing to your phone is literally just unlocking your phone and opening the AirPods case. The headphones are not perfect the few cons I would list are due to the noise cancellation the battery life is only about 4hrs at mid level volume. They don’t have a way for you to control volume on the headphones other than talking to Siri who’s still pretty dumb.', 'I’m really happy with the AirPods Pro. Great sound quality. Transparency and Noise Canceling modes work incredibly well. Great all-around earbuds that do it all and work seamlessly with iOS. I can’t recommend these enough.', \"Don't get these if you're planning to use them as a replacement for traditional headsets for video conferencing. I have a dual monitor setup, a high-speed docking station and all I hear is static and crackling over everyone's voice. Nice toy for your phone, but not for your home office set up. 200 dollars I could have spent on something useful like bose headphones. Which I now have and work great. Very disappointed.\", 'Would not recommend getting the AirPods Pro from Amazon. I should’ve bought them straight from the Apple store. My AirPods Pro were working fine from September until the beginning of December. Now I have a defective pair.  For starters, both AirPods work fine individually. The sound quality is great, but they no longer both connect at the same time. The Bluetooth goes back and forth connecting to each individually. Once I put one in the case the one side will connect. If I want to use the other side once the battery is drained, it takes over 10 seconds to connect to the other side, and vice versa every time I use them. This is a dealbreaker because I bought these to use both sides with the noise cancellation. On top of that the convenience is gone with the wait time. I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max. So it should work smoothly. Save your money and buy it from Apple directly.', \"I buy Apple devices because Apple is quality.  I own the original Apple Air Pods and they were great.  But, the Air Pods Pro is a vast improvement.  The sound is superb.  I bought these last year on Black Friday for $169.  Apple isn't cheap.  When it comes to products that could damage your ear drum --- don't risk your hearing with knock off cheaper products.\", 'I keeps on falling out. The ear fit test is useless in long-term. Noise cancellation is not that great since the noise can still come through. Spatial audio is only available for shows on Apple TV + which makes spatial audio useless on Netflix, Amazon prime video, etc. Mostly really hard to find the perfect ear tip. The wired earphones fit better! Battery dies if you keep the AirPods out of their case overnight.', 'I had the AirPods before but I lost them. I decided to buy the AirPods Pro since that happened. I had been wanting to buy these anyway because the AirPods always fell out of my ears when I worked out. I would sweat and they would slip out. These are great because they stay in my ears. I use the small size silicone tips. They fit perfectly. They never fall out when I walk on a hike or workout at the gym. The nose cancellation is really good too. I like these much more. I think it’s a great improvement on apple’s end', 'I decided to by these Apple Airpods Pro in-ear phones as a gamble. The best audio decision I’ve made in way too long a time. I own 2 audiophile grade in-ear monitors around the $1k range and these Apple phones were a revelation for the money. Extremely comfortable fit over along time and a very detailed pleasing sound, using Spotify for music, that is not fatiguing, with a smooth high end and moderate bass heft… The best part, compared to my more expensive in-ear units, the mid-range is wonderful and detailed. Great value.', 'Even though these might be overpriced, they are some of the best consumer earphones I’ve ever owned. The only other brand that I’ve tried that are cheaper, but similar sound quality are the Raycon’s. Most others were frail and sound quality was ok. Even compared to pro Shure or Sennheiser monitor earphones, the AirPods Pro come close. The noise canceling and sound through features are really great as well. Highly recommended!', 'These are perfect personally I think they are better than the past generations The noise cancellation & transparency mode are really a thing of beauty. For the people that are saying they recieved the product used that is outrageous and truthfully i was extremely skeptical about that which is why i still went ahead and purchased. They came with the plastic on brand NEW!! Glad I purchased they are awesome would definitely recommend!!!', 'I really like the AirPod pros for a number reasons. One reason, that has three ear bud sizes from  small, medium and large to help me find my true size fit. Second, is the both noise and transparency mode(s). The noise cancellation  allows me to play music or watch video on my iPhone in my jobs cafe without hearing my neighbors conversation. The transparency is good when I am out on a walk or job but still am able to listen out for traffic as I go along. Third and last, the case is fast chargeable and I can charge the case alone without the AirPods on my Belkin 3in1 charging pad along with my iPhone and Apple Watch.', 'One would expect top notch performance from a top brand. But, these are half way through. The in ear ANC works quite well. HOWEVER, the microphone and related features are POOR. When I am on phone or conference calls like Google meet, the other side can hear as if I am under water. Broken/echoey audio. My cheap $40 boom Bluetooth Mike works far better in terms of audio clarity and noise cancelling so the other side can hear me well. Isn\\'t that half of the purpose to use a wireless headset?? Very disappointed at Apple. And their customer service was basically \" yup sorry.. yeah I can hear noise over the line.. so it is what it is\". Returning back.', 'Copied from another reviewer who is SPOT ON: \"Love Apple products but I’m tired of their games With the iPhone 11 they introduced the new charging end (not the one that goes into the phone, the one that plugs into the cube then into the receptacle). The AirPods pro comes with the same cable but no cube. This means if you don’t have an iPhone product you can’t charge these period. And the charging wire it comes with is worthless unless you’ve already bought an iPhone 11 Apple charges a ridiculous premium for their products. They should back it with the proper hardware,!!!!\"', 'The sound quality is fantastic BUT...I’ve tried all the earbud sizes and these keep falling out of my ears. So frustrating to make this kind of investment and have them constantly falling out while I do basic tasks like dishes or gardening. I finally purchased another memory foam type of earbud accessory from another vendor and now they work. Ideally, having to spend even more money to fix the issue shouldn’t be the solve.', 'I really wanted to like these, upgrading from AirPods I’ve used for a while. Unfortunately, it only works well as a listening device, not transmitting. Hearing music or the other side of the conversation is great, with ANC and transparency mode. Them hearing you is terrible - as if you put your phone on a desk and are talking from 15ft away. Wish I read the forums before purchasing. Will be returning.', 'These are perfect! I tired the previous AirPods and they just didn’t stay in my ear. The AirPod pro’s are amazing that they stay in your ear even when you violently shake your head. I mainly bought these for use at the gym, but I ended up using them a lot more, even when I’m just hanging out at home. The sound quality and ease of use is great. The charge also lasts a long time. The noise cancellation on these is far better than what I would have expected. Completely blocks out outside noise, even when you aren’t listening to music. No longer have to be annoyed by lawnmowers on Sunday mornings.', \"The noice cancellation and transparency features are amazing for city use and travel use. Flights are peaceful now and commuting isn't so noisy. The sound quality is also better than most of the expensive headphones that I hve purchased. I think the additional cost for noise cancellation and transparency is definitely worth it if you travel a lot or work/live in the city.\", \"it's a typical apple product, built for customer complaint/feedback and upgraded at an increased price after a few months.  for in ear headphones, they are sturdy, decent noise cancelling, seem to stay put when you find the right size ear piece.  but the charging mechanism is typical millenial marketing.  i suppose these headphones assume that you listen to them 24/7.  because if you charge them, listen for 20-1 hr, put them aside, and pick back up a day or 2 later, both headphones and charger are dead and require a rechgarge.  this is where the product wears down and requires a replacement, or the frustration to constantly be charging is minimally upgraded at an increased price.  call me old, but it's confounding that apple or amazon lack of quality and longevity equates wealth and success.\", 'I guess I had higher expectations since they were so damn expensive. My main motivation was to use these while I verbally cued and physically demonstrated fitness via Zoom to keep a consistent, clear volume of my voice while I taught. Nope, this is not where these shine. My computer’s mic was more clear as these made my voice somewhat gravely. They don’t stay in my ears as efficiently as I had hoped-I definitely won’t use them during any HIIT classes and if I’m using them as noise cancellation, it’s a major fail. Yes, the battery life is amazing, if I’m just sitting, listening to music, yes, they’re great... but so are my old headphones at a fraction of the price.', 'They need a option for no stars. I just can’t believe they sent me a pair of AirPods that’s not actual Apple. When you first get them the box and everything looks authentic until you notice no Apple logo or serial number to register device for warranty and add AppleCare for protection. Honestly they do look the same and would have got me if they had the Apple logo on them with a serial number. Smh. Never again. All apple products will be bought at the Apple store.', 'I mostly use these Airpods when commuting to work. The sound quality and noise cancellation are very good.  I also own a pair of the Anker Soundcore P2 wireless earbuds. While they do not have active noise cancellation, in my humble opinion they actually have better bass response than the Apple Airpods Pro. My biggest complaint with the Airpods Pro is the fit. I cannot get a tight seal no matter what I try. None of the supplied ear tips fit my ears perfectly. Had it not been for the fit, I would have rated these 5 stars!', 'You would think apple would have it nailed down. They intermittently connect or don\\'t connect to my iPhone 12 mini. All the software is updated. I have missed important calls because they wont connect. Sometimes if my wife is around and I\\'m on a call they will connect to her phone in the middle of a conversation. I\\'ve tried \"Forget This Device\" on her phone 3 times now... For $220 bucks they definitely suck for sure', \"First things first, I really love the sound quality of these Airpods. I had the Bose QuietComfort II's and these are on par as far as sound quality goes. I love listening to movies in the stereo/3D sound option. It's immersive. I had a huge issue with the fit of the Bose, so I returned them, but these fit great with the medium tips. If you usually have issues with ear tips being too big, give the AirPod Pros a try. That said, I'm a huge binge watcher. I love to chill in bed with my iPad for 5 or 6 hours before bed and these don't cut it as far as battery life. They last maybe 4 hours max with the noise cancellation turned on before they need recharged and I have to switch to my old wired set. If only Apple could somehow make them with a longer battery life, they would be great!\", \"These headphones are fantastic!  I had to change the rubber part to one that fit my ear better (other sized rubber pieces come with it), and since then I seem to find excuses to wear these.  The noise cancellation is absolutely fantastic.  While the battery life of the headphones isn't the greatest (I get a few hours out of them), the charging case provides SEVERAL charges before it needs to be charged.\", 'No one can hear me speak on phone calls, issue is much worse than on regular airpods (non pro). They are not usable for me at all. People can hear the road I am walking on but not the voicec and it is not quiet for sure. I have low tone voice but still a lot of people have low voice', '', 'First I’d like to say is the noise cancellation is awesome. When I’m waking to work I can’t hear any cars going by. These AirPods are comfortable to wear and it has great sound quality. Very similar to my Beats headphones. I was able to get a great deal on these otherwise I would have never purchased them. Overall very satisfied.', \"The Bose QC 35 are better for: - airplanes - conference calls - gym workouts - listening to music The AirPods Pro are better for: - walking the dog - short runs Overall, it is hard for me to recommend the AirPods Pro. The short battery life, subpar noise cancellation, low volume, and high costs don't make sense. My 4-year-old Bose QC35 outperform them in every way except for compactness.\", 'Despite the 3 different tip sizes I still have issues keeping these in my ears when moving around a lot. Transparency is nice and the noise cancelation is good, not great. If I were buying again, I would buy the non-pro version. I like the way the wired ones fit my ears and the non-pros fit the same, and they sound better to me actually. My kids all have the regular pods and they love them. The microphone is sensitive and call quality is really good which is important for me but now I have an occasional buzz in the left pod. IMO, the Pros are overrated and overpriced. Rating = Average.', \"I got this as a gift for my friend. She tested them out right away, and said they felt great. The noise cancelling worked very well, She shook her head and ran with them and said that she didn't think they even moved in her ears. It connected to her phone and mac very quickly. The only issue we ran into was that when she had it connected to her mac, in a video chat it was very difficult to hear her, but on the phone it was perfectly clear.\", 'I love these AirPods so much!! They stay in my ear and do not fall out even when I shake my head or go on a run. I know that they may not stay in for everyone, so I would say test out the waters and make sure you know if the AirPod Pros will fit in your ear. They are also amazingly comfortable, I do not have any discomfort. Battery life is super long as well.', 'AirPods Pro are my first introduction to the AirPods revolution. Upon getting them, I was enamored by how they sounded paired with the 2 different sound modes (transparency and noise cancellation). However, I found that noise cancellation wasn’t as good as I expected and after awhile, it became pretty evident. The AirPods shipped okay but I’ll recommend to new buyers that you get apple care as well. Overall, they’ve now become apart of my daily life. Well worth the money.', 'I would like to add a few comments about how these AirPods survived six weeks outside. I lost my original pair and finally gave up looking and purchased new ones. Sometime after while looking for something else in the shrubs on the side of my house I came upon one of the AirPods nestled in some bushes, and the other one nearby. They were outside in inclement weather. 2 inches of rain, 90° weather four approximately six weeks. I clean them up a bit put them in the case to be charged and lo and behold, they work like new. I would not encourage anyone to try this test, but thought it appropriate to tell you that these might be tough to kill.', 'Finding the right ear tip size can take some time. Even with the right size, my left ear is uncomfortable, which must be due to my ear not the product. The noise cancellation is like a magic trick—amazing. For example, lawnmowers and window air conditioner noise disappears! These creat a very warm sound—nice bass without being excessive.', 'I have tried many different headphones from jaybirds to Bose to beats. I was not a fan of the 1st gen of these because they constantly slipped out of my ear. Ended up loving the beats X and swore I would never switch, until these came out. They have ear grips that will not come out even during an intense hiit workout! And the sound and noise cancellation is the best. I definitely do not regret this purchase!', \"So right off the bat I loved the look and I have enjoyed everything apple. After owing the airpods I figured the pros would be everything the original airpods had plus bonus features. Well sadly I actually liked the originals more. #1) the new ones hurt my ears. I've tried all the tips it comes with.  The original ones could be in my ears all day and I would even forget. Pros hurt and even are sore once out. #2) the battery life is worse than the original airpods. Why? Hasn't technology improved??? #3) the charging cable pros come with is usb c. Why would you make it more difficult for your customers to charge your products. What a simple standard usb that we can use with basically everything we all already own to simple? So the look is better, the noise isolation concept is cool.  But why mess up the stuff that worked better only to replace it with worse tech??\", 'I cannot believe how great the sound is blocked out from everything once I put these in my ear. You cannot hear hardly anything else in the room and I have never fade it out on me, like other brands. I will be buying only apple from here on out. I’ve tried all kinds of other brands including skull candy, Bose, etc. None of them can hold a candle to these', 'After my last gen AirPods started to slowly waste away and die I decided on going for these AirPods pros. Love the way they look and the force pinching mechanism was a neat replacement for the touch sensitivity of the last iteration.  However, after having these for a few days I have finally accepted that these are just painful.  After about 30 mins of having these in my ears, they cause discomfort and soreness on the upper portion of my ear canal.  I am going to wait it out and see if my ears will adjust to the discomfort otherwise they will be going back.  Also it seems that only one of the AirPods seems to want to stay in my ear as the left one continually pushes itself out of my ear every 30-60 seconds and results in the noise cancellation to stop working.  As you can imagine this is maddeningly (!) annoying so I have decided to purchase some foam tips to see if they will help alleviate this huge issue. I loved the last generation of AirPods and wore them until the cows came home, these however, I do not know if I can stand them. The noise isolation is great, they sound good, but jeez for $200+ I was expecting a better feeling product.  I wish that I these were like the last generation where I barely noticed they were in my ear, but alas we can dream.', 'The quality of these earbuds are good, the noise canceling are even better.  The sound quality isn’t that great, treble and bass aren’t very impressive. My problem with these are that they do not stay in my ears.  They lose their seal inside my ear after about a minute or two, and if I don’t immediately reset the seal, they fall out shortly afterwards.  Honestly, it’s only a matter of time before I lose them. I’ve used a lot of earbuds, these aren’t worth the money I paid for them.  The only way I ensure I won’t lose one, or both, is to simply keep them on the case and not use them, because they fall out way too easily.', 'Audio is awesome. Wireless charging in theory is great why does no one complain at the ridiculous need to keep case open to charge when it’s impossible to set it anywhere w/o top slamming shut. I’ve had Apple products for 20 yrs. stuff like this with such high pricing pisses me off.', 'I went from the regular Airpods to the Pros, and overall I really like them. As a student, these come in handy a lot when I\\'m in a public space and need to focus to study/read as the noise cancelation on these is pretty good to where people talking in the background is muffled enough and is then just white noise, even without any music playing. This was not the case when I had the regular Airpods. I really like the noise cancelation, but must admit it\\'s my first time with this feature in a pair of headphones, as I\\'ve only really used Apple headphones for the last 5-8 years at this point. The sound quality is good, better than the regular ones, and overall I like their look and they don\\'t feel uncomfortable in my ears. My biggest thing when comparing them to the regular Airpods however is that I can\\'t talk or eat in them because after a little while the right headphone seems to ever so slowly slide out. This is not really an issue as I can just take out the right headphone while doing these things, but it was never an issue with the regular Airpods, and it is a bit of a \"sacrifice\". It\\'s not a deal breaker and overall I really enjoy the experience of using them, but it\\'s just something to consider (especially for the price tag). If you don\\'t care too much for noise cancellation, and just want easy to use wireless headphones for your iPhone, I think you should save the money and get you some regular Airpods.', 'VERY rarely am I ever inspired to write a review but needed to on these so i can help others.  These are complete trash.  As many other reviewers have stated, these are IMPOSSIBLE to stay in your ears.  I do not want a \"hack\" or have to buy something new to keep them in.  They were $200.  If you run, talk or dislike pain in your ears, don\\'t get these.  You would think that a company like Apple would have done extensive research to make a quality product.  Clearly this is not the case.  An absolute disappointment and letdown from a company that has built itself on making quality products. Just sad.', 'The right side AirPod  does not charge. I have to finagle with it to get it to connect to the charger inside the case. Once it shows me that it is charging, I walk away and let it “hopefully” charge but it never does!!!! Somehow it disconnects on the right AirPod and never charges. Then I always have one fully charged and one with like 2% and it doesn’t work. I have tried everything. I am so disappointed and frustrated.', 'I’ve owned my AirPods for 6 months. Just now the case went caput and no longer charge. When I contact apple support with my serial number to investigate why the charging case no longer works after such a short period of time, they tell me my AirPods are over a year old. But I thought these were brand new from Amazon! Turns out I was told a previously owned pair. Very disappointing considering I paid full price. I would buy these headphones DIRECTLY from apple to be certain. I wish I hadn’t made this mistake.', 'Purchased for the wife.  She is very happy with the new design. Given the old style fell off her ears. Pros: 1- Noise cancelation 2- Ambient noise pass through while she cooks lol. Cons: 1- Battery life Wife doesn’t use them enough for the battery life to truly effect her.  This might work against some folks. Overall Apple truly did an outstanding job on these. Highly recommend overall the rest in the market.', 'The sound quality on these earbuds are immaculate. And when paired with Apple device software, it sounds out if this world. When they say \"noise cancelling\" they mean it. I swear I thought I went deaf when I turned it on. The battery life is great but the earbuds individually only last maybe 4-5 hours when being used. The case can last for 2-3 days when being used constantly. Amazing product.', \"These are great! I bought these because of the reviews giving overwhelming thumbs up, and I agree. They fit perfectly, have great sound quality, and the noise canceling feature is truly remarkable. I use them for my play-along tracks for practicing. The first time I turned on the noise canceling feature, I could not hear my sax at all. I like they are charged in the case when stored, so I'm not fussing with cords. All around another Apple win.\", 'I have shared a picture that shows the amazing seal effect the air pods pro have. It is effective and a tech used for active noise cancelling.  Most importantly! I have wide ear base which means ear headphones like these fall off even without me tilting my head. These headphones are like stuck like glue (doesn’t feel that way, just a metaphor). I have used too loud sounding headphones with good bass. Airpod’s sound quality is amazing yet I feel they could’ve more beat and sound to them.', 'Bought an iPad that wouldn’t charge three months after warranty expiration.  Now these AirPods start crackling after 15 months.  Best Buy said there was an extended warranty due to this known issue. Called  Apple - no such thing.  So I’ve spent $700 on junk after 15 months.', 'I love these AirPods and I haven’t had any since the first generation. These are by far the best AirPods yet and the noise cancelling is insane. Came in two days at a really good price. Only complaint (why I’m giving it a 4 star) is because when I opened the package the Medium sizes ear tips were missing. Nowhere to be found and the AirPods were “naked” with no tips. Thankfully I can use the S/L ones that came in the box. Just wish everything came by default like it does in the store. Great purchase! (In the picture the Large tips are installed , Mediums missing)', 'I bought these because I needed wireless earbuds for falling asleep. I often watch tv as I’m falling asleep & don’t want to bother my husband. I didn’t realize how much I would like these. I use them during the day and appreciate that I can take phone calls & use Siri while wearing them. I gave them 4 stars because they aren’t as comfortable as I would like for sleeping (I’m a side sleeper).', 'Tried many earpods and none compare to these. Granted, I was going for less expensive options than the Airpod Pros but after some issues with using them w/ Zoom/Teams/etc, decided to pay out for these and not disappointed. Sound is crystal clear on calls, rich sound playing music, ANC is very effective, and generally like the fit. Not sure they are worth all the money but I do like them a lot.', \"The original AirPods are one of the best Apple products I own - and I have lots of apple equipment. Love my regular set so much, I had to buy the pro's. I thought they would be an improvement. I use both pairs - when the battery runs low on one set, I switch them for the other. So I'm reminded everyday of the differences. here's no contest - the original (and cheaper) AirPods are superior to the pros. If I had known this, I would have just bought a 2nd set of the original AirPods. In summary,  the originals: -Feel better in my ear -Never fall out during exercise -Are just simpler - I never have to switch modes. There's only one mode ;-)  If I want real noise cancellation, I just wear my over-ear Bose earphones. The NC on the Pro's is okay, but is no comparison to my over ear Bose.\", 'I was really excited to try these out- I’m a huge Apple fan, but Apple disappointed me this time. I did not like the earlier versions of the AirPods and I expected so much more from the Pro. Overall, noise cancellation is amazing, it’s a great feature. But they Kept falling out my ears. Even with smallest plugs, I could not walk around and COOK without them coming out. As for sound quality, I excepted so much more!!! It’s fair but it’s not what I expected $200 to sound like...', 'Well I got these because I get a lot of calls at work and is nice to just pop these in while I work but then I took a flight from New York to New Orleans on Spirit Airlines…. Yeah quickest way there with no stop. I popped these in with no music and just the noise canceling and WOW. It shuts all noise out and I was able to sleep on the flight! Great earbuds. Thanks Apple and Amazon!', 'Wow. The noise cancellation on these things🤯 Hate your partner? Tired of these kids bouncing off the walls at home? Annoying coworkers? None apply to me, but if that is you, this is a product for you. DO NOT use noise cancellation headphones if you are watching small children. In addition to  noise cancellation, the ability to ping your pods is also v convenient if you’re someone who loses small things. The only draw back is that these AirPods is that they do not fit as well in my ears, and fall out more often than the original AirPods.', 'If you like expensive ear pods that constantly fall out of your ears then this item is for you. Sound is awesome but they fall out of my ears with me even moving. I have tried the different size ear cups that it comes with and they still fall out. Apple make cool stuff but these suck! Don’t waste your money.', \"I would recommend this product over the knockoffs I've tried. I did some online research for the best dupes and landed on Dangobuds. They were about $100 cheaper, but in my opinion, not at all comparable to a more expensive ear bud. They broke when I dropped them in a slop bucket at the pottery studio. I rejoiced, feeling justified to buy a new pair of Airpods Pro. The ease of pairing the apple brand ear buds with the iPhone is a big plus. Sound quality is really upgraded from the first gen airpod, and the noise cancellation works well even without music playing. I would stick with the reliable brands in this case, if you care at all about sound quality, comfort, etc.\", 'Not the best sound quality or fit. No matter what I can’t get them to pass the ear for test. I’ve tried very combination of tip and they still don’t fit well. My Jaybird Vistas have become my go to headphones. These are for calls in the car and on the go. One earbud has developed a pretty serious crackle and pop after about 4 months. I wanted to like them but they’re ok at best.', 'So I have owned a few knock offs and wanna be’s for air pods pro...there is honestly no comparison. I have a set of Pamu’s and they aren’t even in the same league honestly. Yes they are $200, but if you want something that sounds really good, and are comfortable in the ear, this is it. These really are that good and really worth the money. Noise cancellation is really good as well. Only thing that could be improved is the 4.5hr useable time before needing to recharge the ear pieces. But, they recharge in only 20 mins. So that’s not too bad.', 'First of all I AM A HUGE APPLE FAN, so this review is truly something I hate to do but it must be done. I HAVE THE ORIGINAL AIRPODS THAT FIRST CAME OUT AND THEY ARE AMAZING THEY SLIP HERE AND THEre while im working out but overall a 10/10..now the pros! Omg the worst they keep slipping! The memory foam ear tips do not work.. sound canceling works like advertised, but man the constant slipping out of ear sucks!', 'I am so happy with my AirPods Pro! As an avid Apple user, I was very excited to have an earbud option that features noise cancellation technologies and connects easily to all my devices. I appreciate the multi sized tip options that come with the AirPods as I have smaller ears that regular earbuds typically don’t fit. I have worn these working out, at the office, and doing chores around the house and don’t have an issue with them falling out. I have also worn these on a number of flights and they work well to cancel out the engine noise. The noise cancellation feature does drain the battery quicker than when it is off, but even without this feature on a lot of noise is blocked out. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone!', 'Noise cancellation excellent. Sound quality good. Battery life shorter than I expected. Absolute worst aspect--they do not remain in my ears. Walking around my house, worst is if I tilt my head down, as when leaning over out the come. I tried all three ear pieces that come with the Airpods. I need reliable, stay in the ear pods, not just look pretty. Returning and looking for something else.', 'I was going between getting the regular AirPods and the pros. I’m so glad I went with the pros! WFH means I’m on a lot of calls and conferences, I don’t have to deal with the hassle of wired headphones. Additionally, I’ve worked out with these headphones and have no issues with them falling out or feeling like they would fall out ( bonus points for the noise cancellation because I couldn’t hear the other people talking!) I was also concerned that they would hurt my ears because I’ve had a history of in ear headphones/plugs hurting my ears and giving me a headache, but I’ve had these headphones in for extended periods and haven’t had an issue.', \"I wanted something wireless and noise-canceling. Would have got the AirPods Max if they had been out at the time, but I'm happy with the AirPods Pro. Negatives: The sound is bass-heavy, and every once in a while you have to re-seat the AirPods to get fully effective noise cancellation (which works great when the APs are seated). I wish there were a way to adjust volume on the APs themselves. The mic doesn't work on Windows. Positives: Excellent range. The battery lasts forever. Other than the heavy bass, the sound is great. Very easy to switch them between different devices. The case is handy to keep them from getting lost. They fit in the ear pretty well.\", 'Bought these here due to these being sold out at every store I’ve ran into. After purchasing these here, I saw a few reviews here saying this seller gave them fake ones? So I was super sketched and skeptical. But when I got these, I checked the product and serial number. These are indeed legit Airpods Pro by Apple. So thank god for that. Anyways. These are pretty fun to listen to with, the transparency and noise cancellation modes are dope and I’m glad I got these. (EDIT:) So yeah, at first they’re great and everything but after 1-2 months in, they started popping on me. Now the left earbud is stuck with a glitchy irritating poppy sound and now they’re completely useless.', 'Exactly what I wanted. I work out in these every day and have had these for about 2 months. The battery lasts forever, the noise canceling is amazing (let’s me focus on the task I am handling at the time), the sound is perfect, bonus they are waterproof (they do slip some when I am sweating a lot).  Very happy with this purchase.', 'I really like the AirPod pros, I just wish that they would fit my ears better. I have had them fall out several times I am because they don’t fit as tight as they should the noise cancellation is not perfect. They need to make more of the rubber pads of different sizes because some of us have smaller ears. Also the battery life is not that great on them.', \"These worked great right out of the box. They stay put for PT and only get loose/fall out when sweating heavily on a spin bike. Don't think I'd ride with them on the open road but love them for the gym. I work out for about 45 min daily and only need to charge the base once a week.\", 'I want to love these so much. I did love these, actually- for almost a month I’ve been using them daily - they’re incredible for the gym because I can phase out the sound of everything around me. They rocked, until the other day when I popped them in and one of the airpods was completely dead. I tried to see the battery level on my phone and couldn’t get my phone to pop the info up- had to add battery life to my widgets just to see that my R bud was 0%, and the case and L bud were 100%. I thought maybe I didn’t have them in the case correctly so I took them out, put them back in, and a little while later my L bud was now 1% and the R was 100%. It made no sense but it completely ruined my workout. I unpaired and paired, I left case plugged in- I did every trouble shooting method I could think of but nothing’s working. Returning these for a replacement (which Amazon says will take weeks to come in 😡) and if that doesn’t work I’m going to buy directly from Apple and see if that makes a difference. I hope the new pair comes quick and works well- because everything about them before this issue began was amazing. I’ll update when I receive the new pair.', 'SE DAÑARON EN MENOS DE UN AÑO DE USO. La cancelación de ruido activa es excelente. El volumen adecuado. No es bueno en graves, unos medios aceptables. La calidad del sonido en general no es muy buena, pero la claridad en las llamadas telefónicas no tiene comparación, es excelente. El modo transparencia se dañó a los 8 meses de uso (con un uso promedio de 2 horas al día), a pesar del extremo cuidado que tuve con los audífonos. Cuando se activa el modo transparencia se escucha una interferencia insoportable cuando se habla durante las llamadas telefónicas. De haberlo sabido no los hubiera comprado.  Audífonos muy caros.', 'I was astounded!! Just the initial fit of the new ear piece had me impressed. Then the active Josie canceling mode kicked in, and my house became silent! I couldn’t hear my ceiling fan running, the clock ticking, or even my central air! It’s like being submersed into an entirely different world! I did yard work with these air pods...I had to switch to transparency mode to make sure my gas mower engine was operating properly. That’s how well it did at the active noise canceling! But I equally enjoy the transparency mode, because I can be carrying a full blown conversation with someone in person and still be listening to my music at a low volume. Not to mention the call quality! I am so happy with my purchase! Completely worth with every penny!', 'The only issue I have been having is at random times they make a shock noise and i have to take the ear bud out and put it back in the case. Things that could be improved on is another level of noise cancellation, because admittedly it doesn’t totally cancel out all the noise e.g.  if you’re in a public area. Lastly, it would be nice if the case itself had a “find my” feature because I had trouble finding it a few times now and it would be so much easier if it had a tracking to it.', 'The noise cancelling feature is excellent provided you have them fitted in your ear properly. I tested it while walking 20-30 feet from a fast moving freight train. The bat in the ear pieces last approx. 4-5 hrs. continuous play, but they recharge rather nicely, to last longer, if you put them back into their container for 15-20 minutes.', 'So far so good, came in original box which was not brand new but in good shape. It had Apple AirPod Pros with all the original parts included, new ear pieces.... Charging box has a few dings/scratches but nothing major & it works just fine. The AirPods are perfect . I haven’t really tested the battery life yet. Stretched it to 2 hours but haven’t tried to go past that yet. Happy with the purchase so far, wasn’t a lot cheaper than just buying them brand new but worth it so I could get them right away instead of waiting til the new ones are in stock', 'I’ve had the first gen AirPods When they first came out and they were the best thing ever at the time.  I was skeptical about purchasing $250 headphones for mini versions that looked like a knock off of AirPods but in actuality it’s a solid buy.  Battery lasts much longer, quality is a difference (not super heavy on bass which is a bummer) and light too great for working out, lifting and running.  Taking calls for work or personal is always great with the noise cancellation feature.  Does take a bit to get used to the ‘tight’ feeling of the fit itself but it becomes like second nature when you wear it so often. A huuuuuge step up from the 1st gen by far.', \"Having a case that can independently charge the Airpods is great -- I'm not an all-day listener, but I just don't worry about running out of juice. Sound is great if... Noise cancellation is good if... If one of the 3 removable ear buds fits you. Mine fit OK, but they would fall out if I jumped around even a little. Apple REALLY should offer a greater size range. But otherwise, excellent tech for my needs.\", \"I bought the air pods pro thinking that they would stay in my ears and function properly while I'd go on runs.  This is unfortunately not the case.  Despite experimenting with the different fittings provided, they consistently fall out of my ears during pretty much any type of workout.  Even just doing a set of push ups they'll find a way to pop out.  On top of this, sometimes on ear will fail to connect, or they'll just cut out and send a loud ringing noise that is very unpleasant.  You have to pop them back in the case and try to reconnect to resolve.  Take away:  If your looking for a pair of headphones to workout with, these simply DO NOT get it done, don't let a high price point fool you.\", \"I'm sure there are plenty of better or more expensive earbuds out there, but I gotta say, these are incredible. The noise canceling is amazing for the size of them. The audio quality is good. Not epic...but really good. But the noise canceling...great. and the transparency mode is great if you need to have a conversation or hear traffic etc. Overall I'm just really impressed.\", \"I travel for work, and I am on conference calls often.  I am very disappointed in the AirPods Pro.  While sound is good, it seems that is only thing Apple focused and tested.  Here's what I've discovered over the past few months of daily use: * The noise cancellation is okay -- it certainly helps.  But it causes ear pain due to a very high pitch when not when there is not audio playing through, and it certainly doesn't silence the outside environment completely. * I have AirPods too.  I never had people tell me when using my AirPods they could not hear me.  With the AirPods Pro, I would say more than half of the calls, people cannot hear me clearly.  The microphone seems to be garbage -- people say I sound like I am underwater. * Often, I'll start a call on my iPhone X without using the AirPods Pro.  If the conversation needs to become private, I'll then put them in my ears.  The time it takes for the iPhone to transfer the call is long -- long enough that the person on the other end cannot hear anything, even background noise, thinks they lost me, and then hangs up.  During this time, I do not hear anything either.  It is frustrating. I'm going to go back to the original AirPods, and I will buy Bose QC20 which I had years ago that worked great.\", \"I love these headphones a little more than life itself. I couldn't imagine one day without them. the noise cancellation brings me peace in a chaos. I've needed AppleCare like 3 or 4 times over the time I've had them to repair them, or correct a battery life issue or whatever. It's the best insurance process purchase you'll make.\", '', \"I've never understood Apple earphones. They've always been the most poorly designed things, horrible sound quality and the fit seems like the designers have never actually seen a human ear. I found these to be merely an expensive version of the free ones they used to give with phones. Horrible design, painful to wear, sound quality on par with a $3 Chinese made driver. I really don't understand how people can like these things.\", \"First impression was 5 thumbs up. Great sound quality and a great fit into my ears. Range is excellent too with my iPhone sitting on my desk, I can walk all over my home and even outside with no static or loosing connection. But It's my experience so far the battery life stinks.  Took them out of their charging box this early morning, It's been about 3 hours and the charge is down to 31% with just standby usage. Love these air pods pro but so far the battery life is a deal breaker. If I'm on the road or otherwise out and about I'll have to carry the charging case with me.\", \"Very please with my purchase of Airpods pro. I have small ears and needed earbuds that wouldn't cause a lot of pain. These come with 3 size soft ear tips for a good comfortable fit. The features to change songs and alternate between on/off... works very easily. The sound quality if pretty fabulous and then stay put when I am running- that is a big deal. The plus is I sweat a lot and these little babies can handle that just fine.\", 'Once you go pro, Noise concealing, you’ll never go back.  I live near an airport and I can see planes landing from my backyard, it’s noise. When I listen to these I can hear my music and see the planes, there is something odd about seeing them and there is no noise.... these are worth every penny, I can’t believe I held out this long. When you walk you can still hear things but you see so much more that you can’t hear anymore, all the noise pollution went away.', 'I bought these high end AirPods after reading many reviews. Most were very positive and I do like the sound and initial connection.  However, I do a lot of walking for exercise and these did not perform well at all.  In the first block of my walk the connection to the phone was broken at least 10 times.  I have a pair of $29.00 buds that work a whole lot better.  They to lose connection but only 3 time in a 2 mile walk.  I sent these back.  Too expensive for such performance.', 'I never realized the level of ambient noise in my office until I put these on at work. Wow! The bliss of silence is unreal. The music sound quality is good too, but I find myself turning the volume up pretty high when I’m in a noisy place like my gym. I’m still trying to figure out which rubber earpiece fits me best, so they don’t come out during my workout. That happens to me with every in ear headphone I have tried. It’s not a big deal, but I wish I could get a custom fit to my ear.', 'I hate to admit it, but I’ve had no problems with these AirPods. I bought several knock off Bluetooth ear only headphones and they all start having connectivity problems or sound problems shortly after I get them. Now the difference between the two types being money, these are over $200 where as the knock offs have been between $20-60. So if you have the money and your willing to spend it on headphones these are the best your money can buy, but if your ok with lower quality headphones and just want a cheap pair with the same basic functionality, there are lesser qualities out there for sure. I will say these have a bunch of bonus setting etc when paired with iPhones but that’s a given', \"Well the first month was amazing! Loved them and took them everywhere with me. After a couple days I looked up the ways in which apple recommended cleaning them. I did it just as they said. About a month later (I'm not sure what had caused it) but after cleaning them like I usually do every couple days, i started hearing a rattling noise. Like there is something loose inside my left earbud. Idk what it is or if it had anything to do with cleaning it, but i did it the way apple suggested. It works just fine. But its just annoying to hear the rattling whenever i lightly tap the button located on it.\", 'If there was zero stars it would be zero. Spent over $200 for these premium earphones and Apple no longer provided a way to charge them. Yes it does come with a lightning cord but if you don’t have a MAC you will need to drop more cash just so you can charge them. Horrible... called Apple and they acknowledge that this is how they are operating going forward. Just disappointed and shocked. Terrible money grab. Shame on you Apple!', 'I’ve been using these for about a month now and I’m happy with the purchase. I wanted something smaller than an older set of Bose QCs I’ve had, but still a good amount of Noise Cancellation. These AirPods fit the bill for all my needs. They have plenty of battery life, sound great, cancel out white noise very well, and aren’t as big as previous models of AirPods. I also use them for running and don’t have much issue with them coming loose, every few minutes I check them (probably out of habit) and adjust them but it doesn’t interfere with a nice jog.', 'When I first bought them they didn’t come with no issues.later on the issues surfaced.batteries.One should buy the warranty with your purchase?

I wasn’t entirely sure how these would work out as most ear pieces don’t fit well into an ear that has an odd angle to it. Well, much to my surprise these fit my ears perfectly. I was very impressed with the noise canceling and the sound enhancement. More than I thought I’d be. The audio is not audiophile grade but it’s adequate for what these are. All in all I’m very impressed and am keeping them.', 'Those are amazing...  noise canceling is the strangest noise and the mode where you can hear everything... thats scary good. Definitely worth it, has wireless and wired charging. My only complaint was using them when changing elevations quickly the pressure doesn’t feel that good.', 'Very upset the airpods does not come with a charger. The price I paid a charger should be included. It took 2 weeks for product to be in stock then another week to receive. Very disappointed', 'I brought these off amazon because target was out of stock. These are not like the last air pod pros I purchased. It does not have good quality sound cancellation and these air pods have ALOT of static noise. They disconnect from the phone often and has to be reconnected/pair back to my iPhone 11 pro max. Wish I would have waited until target came back in stock for the real air pod pros. I guess I brought a defective pair off of amazon. waste of money.', \"I've had about 5 hands free ear sets before the AirPods pro and this is by far the best thing I've ever encountered. I'm extremely happy and I have no regrets on purchasing this. Just make sure to use all the features that this comes with. (In: Settings, Bluetooth, and then Info button).

The contents of the AirPods was strung about the shipping box. The right ear bud would slide apart upon removing it from the case, exposing wiring and internal mechanisms. The right ear bud did not function at all. The left ear bud had very bad sound quality. Amazon is replacing the item in 2 business days. If the next replacement isn\\'t in working order, I will request a refund. Not worth the risk-$175.00 going with the used version, when a brand new set is only around $200.00. Very unsatisfied at the moment.', \"I think, they (Amazon) sell used products (or defected). 1. When I first connect with my phone it showed a saved name ( sweetie's airpod pro) 2. From the very beginning, I'm observing charging problem.  Several time case was fully charged but one airpods battery completely dead (airpod was in the case over night) 3. Sometimes I also observed connectivity problem, left airpod disconnect & again connect by itself number of times. Don't try to save your $10 or $20 by purchasing from Amazon, purchase apple products from their trustworthy website or shop. Thank you\", \"I tried and I tried to love, them but the just aren't worth it. The original Airpods I loved.  They were worth every penny. Unfortunately, these just didn't seem as polished. They have all the features you'd want but I'd consistently loose connectivity, the left or the right would stop playing audio, and I had to replace a faulty earbud. I got tired of messing with them and had to send them back. I wish these were a better product. Apple, you're better than this.\", 'The almost weightless air pods are amazing. The next level is their ability to noise cancel. It determines the most constant sound and virtually \"erases\" it. On my flights, the engine roars are (almost) gone, allowing me to read in a quiet environment. Wishing I could use the noise cancelling all the time!', \"I have used Apple's earpods for years without significant issue, but based on recommendations, I  decided to invest in these AirPods when I needed new audio support, including the Apple Care option in case my investment stopped working. When they work, they work great, but in only a few months, I had an issue with the charging case and thought it would be easy to get it checked out and replaced with the Apple Care I had purchased. This was not the case. Instead, I was left without the AirPods due to poor customer service. Will allow for 2 stars given the product works fine in general (when not broken), but would not bother with the Apple Care if they don't honor it anyways, and may just stick with the cheaper earpods from now on.\", \"I've been happily using Jabra 65t with Android for a while now and decided to add Apple Airpods Pro (AAP). As hoped, the AAP have good sound and an effective transparent mode, are lightweight and the more comfortable choice for extended wear. Had to Google to find the solution to AAP low volume on Android but once that was resolved, the AAP performed as desired. AAP controls on the stems are a smart design.\", 'I have the first generation as well and this new one is terrible if you need to get on a conference call. With noise cancellation you hear yourself muffled, and with the cancellation off there is this terrible hiss while you voice feedback is horrible.  That said, noise cancellation works great for music and podcasts. I keep using the old ones for my calls. Not really worth the $ if you want to use them on business.', 'Have had these headphones as a replacement for another pair of wireless headphones that did not have noise cancellation. As a student, long study sessions with active noise cancellation (ANC) is important to me: ANC makes my head hurt. When using them for a period of longer than 20 minutes, they make my head feel \"full\" and I can only describe it as a pressure sensation. If you are buying these purely for the noise cancellation, look more into over-the ear headphones. The transient noise cancellation from the \"off\" feature (between ANC and \"transparency mode\") is usually enough to block out most of the sound in a quieter library, but in a collaborative facility/office space, it may be less useful. In short, the headphones sound AMAZING. My ears are pretty normal, so for those whom in-ear headphones have worked in the past, I would highly recommend them as a high-quality listening tool. The only drawback I have found is the ANC making my head hurt. Suitable for short bus rides or walking by loud construction, but not good enough for long coffee shop study sessions. Quality Apple product.', 'When my daughter raved about her Airpods I was ho-hum. I bought my wife a pair and she raved about them. So I bought myself a pair and let me tell you they are impressive. The sound quality is amazing. They literally set themselves up to use. The charging case is really slick and they actually do cancel noise around you by the tip of your finger. So now I rave about them.', 'After reading the amazing review on rtings.com for these, I was pretty impressed. My gen 1 air pods broke and I decided to go for it since I had already done my research. These are everything the reviews say and more. So portable, efficient, and such good sound quality. The bass is even and not boosted like cheap headphones like to do. The battery life is unreal, I can not charge these for a week and be fine. They fixed the annoying thing where if your ears are shaped weird then the airpods stick out funny. With these, they are designed so no matter what your ears are like, they won’t make you look stupid. I had that problem with the gen 1 airpods, and they always stuck out. It’s a little thing, but it is nice they fixed it', 'I like that they are wireless and pretty easy to use.  The medium size tips hurt my ear after a while.  I tried to change them out, but cannot....cannot....pop off the tips .  It looks so easy on u-tube.  I just can’t do it.  Ugh.  Also, one of them fell out while I was picking up garden waste.  I will look for an ear hook adapter for yard work.', 'I have the latest iPhone 11 Pro Max. Following the instructions in the air pods pro box, they paired instantly. They work very good at canceling 80% of the noise while I am playing music (mostly Pandora). The music quality is also very good. If you have kids (moms especially) these are fabulous at “turning down” the kid noise. I highly recommend the air pods pro.', 'After weeks of searching, I finally found a set of earbuds to do as they say. They work Beautifully!! The only thing that I wish Apple would change is that the noise cancellation would work with a single year versus both. You cannot use both while driving… Hope that is fixed on the next series.', 'I received and was so excited I own the 2nd gen AirPods and I love them but these were giving me fake! Or used/refurbished! Box came unwrapped and so did the AirPods! They fit my ear weird they would pop up on my phone and I tried everything even charging them nothing I dont think these are real and if they are they were refurbished sadly', \"This is a significant upgrade over the the first two Airpods releases. The key  difference is in its noise cancellation feature. You can be in a room where others are talking or watching TV  and you can listen to music without background noise.  That's a plus for many settings. I also have the Bose QC 35s  --the noise cancelling is better --they will block out airplane noises --I don't believe the Airpods Pro model will. However, they are bulky and you can't just carry them around with you.\", 'Why are they so unreliable with connecting?  Yes, I gone through the routine of forgetting the device and reconnecting often to no avail. The right connects but not the left! Fully charged pairing with an iPhone 12 mini, and it’s hit and miss.  I’m sorry I bought them.', 'The first pair quit charging the left pod shortly after purchase so I got a replacement. This current set has done the same thing a few weeks past the “return window”. This is a great product WHEN YOU CAN GET IT TO CHARGE. Apple has known about the defective design but, to protect their bottom line, they do nothing. I feel as though I purchased them from Donald Trump. What a rip-off!', 'Pros: You get to prove to all of your friends and co-workers you\\'ve made it by having the \"newest and greatest\" hip Apple product Sound quality pretty good Pretty seamless connection to Apple devices (see cons for problem here) Cons: Earbuds can\\'t achieve proper noise cancellation - require earmuffs over. Cost way too much. Jumps connections when multiple devices are adjacent to one another.  I have 2 phones and if I unlock one it\\'ll jump between devices. Compact earwax into ear TLDR - You\\'re paying for brand and style, not function.  I love Apple products but these aren\\'t worth the $$$.  If you want noise cancelling, you need over-the-ear headphones.', 'I tried so hard to love these :( The AirPods would gradually slip out of my ears until they would just plop out. I tried changing the sizes of the tips, adjusting the way they were placed in my ear, and making sure my ears were clean, etc. NOTHING worked. While the sound and noise cancellation was nice it didn’t really matter because I couldn’t use them than 5 minutes without readjusting or picking it up after it fell. My boyfriend likes them and took them off my hands so it’s all good though.', 'I love these! I got them earlier this week and have been wearing them non-stop since. They fit perfectly in my ear and I love that I don’t have to worry about them falling out even when I’m jumping around while workout out. The noise cancellation is good, not perfect but there is a very noticeable difference between transparency mode and noise cancellation mode. They also read my texts to me which I think is a nice feature (I have an iPhone, not sure about other brands).  They were on the pricey side but Amazon is selling for cheaper than Apple so I am happy.', 'I tried numerous headsets and keep coming back to these. Plain and simple they are the best headset for you iPhone. So, if you are tired of trying to save money and convincing yourself the cheaper ones will do the same thing and sound just as good Get these you want be disappointed', 'I use these all the time for video calls at work, but they definitely aren’t an all-in-one product. For starters the sound cancellation is okay but the fit is terrible. I’ve tried all of the silicone ear pieces it came with and these won’t stay in my ears even during moderate workouts. For the price I expected these to meet the most common use cases but not working for exercise brings a 4.5 earbuds down to 3 stars for me. Really overhyped.', 'Cons: don’t fit well and sometimes fall out of my ears when walking, sound quality is mediocre (which is disappointing for the price), tricky to control the volume when connected to my Windows computer (especially during Zoom use, for some reason) Neutral: battery life is okay Pros: conveniently wireless and supports wireless charging, connects to my iPhone easily, microphone works well, noise cancelling works well', \"The Airpods work fine with my phone, but not at all when I want to listen to anything on my computer.  There is a crackling noise in both ears.  I have updated everything, resynced, even called apple support.  Nothing helped.  I may just return there.  Not worth spending all the money if I can't even use them with my computer.\", 'They actually stay secured in my ears unlike the original air pods. Thanks to the silicone attachments. I can lean over with the older style and they fall right out of my ears. These stay nice and secure. Love how you press on the stems and you can hear the click in your ear for play/pause and such. I could never get the older style to respond by tapping on them. Huge improvement overall. The secureness in my ears and the pressing on the stems are my favorite features. Yes apple should give the charger block with the cable especially for the price they charge.', \"Wow!  Got these Airpod Pros for my wife for Christmas (bought early in Dec). She had been using the second gen airpods and loved them (never had a problem).  She tried using them a week after Christmas.  Immediately, she started having problems connecting one airpod.  The other side seemed to work ok.  She continued trying to use them, but some days one airpod or the other would be dead (like it wasn't connecting to charge).  By the end of January, she took a trip to Atlanta and they were basically unusable - showed connected, but couldn't hear or be heard.  The other airpod side died after about 9 minutes, so basically L and R airpods were defective.  Would be on the charger all night- one would charge and the other one would not.  Tried to return them to Amazon and they said that the return time had expired even though it was a gift wouldn't return them, even though she had only used them for about 30 days.  Missed the window by two days.  I would be very very very careful ordering any electronic equipment from Amazon and if you have any problems send them back immediately (even if the problem seems very slight- if it gets worse, you won't be able to return).  Extremely disappointed!  I've had 10-15 different Apple products and have never had a problem.  Also, never had a problem returning an item to Amazon.  Horrible experience.  I will never buy electronics from Amazon again.\", \"Forget using these if you do any yard work, working out or anything else where you might sweat. These things don't stay in! I've tried all of the included sizes, made sure my to remove all of the oil in my ears. I bought a lanyard to keep from losing them when  they do fall out.  I'm so disgusted with these things. If these weren't a gift from my wife I'd send them back. Search the web. I'm not the only one with this problem. Come on Apple! Over-priced.\", \"I love the first model of AirPods and the pros are definitely a step up. The wireless charging is great for me as I like the flexibility of charging both ways. I think the noise cancelation feature could be bumped up a little more as I can still catch the noise of someone else in the room. I reach for over ear headphones if I'm working and can still hear my partner. My biggest issue is I lost my first pair and only noticed after the battery was dead that they were gone, could no longer track them on find my iphone. I now have a case and clip on this second pair and keep them clipped to my car keys. Fingers crossed I someday find the first pair!\", 'The majority of my mobile phone time is for business purposes...conference calls, etc. I fell once again for the \"try the latest Apple product! Its the best! You\\'ll love it!\" when by trusty headset died. AirPods are terrible for calls. The battery doesn\\'t last very long, they turn off and on for no reason, and when they do work, its like listening through a coffee can. I gave an extra star (2 instead of one) because they are great for listening to music. The audio quality for music is much better than during phone use.', 'When i Decided to get new AirPods I really wasn’t expecting these to work that well .WOW when you use noise canceling mode it works very well you can feel in your ear leaving no sound able to come though the transparency mode is super cool you can still hear your surroundings very well and listen to music just as good i have had no better experience with headphones i would recommend buying !!', \"There are many pluses to these. Sound quality, charging ease and functionality,looks. They would have gotten 5 stars from me if only I could turn the volume up a bit more. You can't play music too loud. So I use other headphones when I want to get pumped and motivated\", 'I didn’t expect much beyond convenience. I mean, how good can pod type headphones be ? Turns out they are very good. Immediately jettison the tips that come with these and purchase a 3 pack of Amazon finest AirPod memory foam tips. The sound is impressive. I do everything from write code to dig tree stumps with my tractor with these and the sound is awesome.', 'The ANC is really impressive considering the size of the AirPods. The firmware update released the same date as my purchase was a nice added surprise.', 'I love these things, but they sure do hurt I had the medium ear tips on they fell out then even with my smaller pieces on they fall out and hurt my ears too', \"I don't normally write reviews, but I'm sick of these headphones; I'm constantly having problems with them. First it was crackling in one earbud. So I sent it in and they sent me a replacement. Now the other side is starting to have the same problem. All along there has been connectivity and charging issues. These headphones are supposed to disconnect when they're put back in the case to charge. With mine I'll put them in the case overnight, put my headphones in the next day, and find that one side (it alternates as to which side it is) is dead, this is because one side will occasionally stay connected to bluetooth from inside the case and thus not charge. I'm just tired of it all. For $250, these headphones shouldn't consistently have all of these problems, all the time. The noise cancellation and transparency modes are nice, when the headphones ever work. But for this kind of money I could have bought another brand without all the headaches.\", 'I bought these as a birthday present for my wife. She LOVES them; cant stop talking about them. I tried them out to see what all of this noise was about, and wow, they are great!  The noise canceling feature really cuts out external sound (if you turn off the music, you’re deaf)…. sound quality really outstanding!', 'Every day I have to play around with these to get them to connect to my Macbook Pro.  Yes, the batteries are charged.  Sometimes it will connect but I cannot hear any sound.  I usually have to end up removing the device and re-pairing.  Even then it they will oscillate between connected and disconnected.  I purchased these because I thought it would work well with Apple products, but alas this is not the case.', 'So the sound quality is tremendous. Probably ruined me for other headphones. I think the Siri interaction is great, much better compared to the original airpods. The noise cancellation definitely works, really blocks out the world, although it gives this kind of suction feel when you turn it on that I don’t love, but I guess it’s necessary for that sealed off to the world fit. I purchased these to run with as I heard they don’t fall out like the old AirPods, true so far-but the one on my left ear feels a tad loose as I run , so I end up adjusting it ever so often to make sure it’s not about to drop out of my eat and hit the street. I tried all the tip sizes , it’s nice they have those different options. They still end up falling out of my ear when I sleep sometimes though, which is annoying, so I don’t typically use them for that anymore.', 'Bought these thinking they would be less painful wearing compared to the AirPods but that’s not the case they actually hurt my ears more so than the airpods. Battery life is par I find myself constantly charging them and the speakers aren’t very loud when in a phone call, noise cancellation is nice but not enough to justify keeping them.', 'I didn’t like the fact that I’ve spent over a thousand dollars with you guys through out the years of buying the air pods when they first came out maybe a month or so I purchased my third pair of AirPods which the left side ear went dead for some obvious reason and I haven’t had them for three days I did nothing to them on my end so at that point I just was fed up with air pods that only added more to the situation because I was already feeling like I wasn’t getting the best sound anymore that’s why I had ordered another pair and so from that day I made the switch to Bose and I love them way better then air pods in every department if you ask me big upgrade I didn’t mind paying the extra $100', \"Awesome! I've had BT headphones for years. LG, Jabra, etc. The integration with iPhone is great. No dropped connections, great battery life, the noise cancellation is better than anything I've had before. I finally got tired of having the BT band around my neck, especially when it's hot or working out. The transparent mode could be a little clearer but it's worth it.\", \"I was a little hesitant due to the price, but money well spent.  The regular airpods kept falling out of my ear during workouts.  The pros stayed in while running and lifting.  I haven't tried boxing yet.  I'm sure they'll stay in.  Calls sound good, on both ends.  Noise cancellation is pretty good.  Ok. Happy I got them.\", \"My earpods got kettle sound, noise whenever I put them in my ear, sometimes I sleep wearing them to block the noise out. but I would be woken up by this sharp noises. instead of noise canceling. It's high-pitch noise creating headphons. very disappointing. And you could not find any ways to return or replace them due to covid situation. very bad for Apple to provide this type of expensive but nod good quality product.\", \"I'm 67 and a little hard of hearing (I wear hearing aids).  These AirPods produce enough volume and beautiful sound that I can really enjoy music again.  And the noise cancellation is impressive.  I can wear them while using my table saw and hardly hear the saw at all.\", 'So far so good. Battery life doesn’t seem all that good. I verified the product I received with apple via the serial number so I know it’s really from apple. A couple times the sound has seemed off or weird. Not sure if it’s the product or the Bluetooth connection. Will keep you updated. Other than all that it’s a really good product. Good to be hands and wire free. Noise cancellation is really good but I personally don’t like it.', 'I used these with my iPhone. Since they’re in the Apple ecosystem they pair flawlessly with my device. Honestly, these are overpriced when you take into account the battery life and the ill fit. I’ve tried the three different sizes of tips that come with the Apple AirPod Pros. It doesn’t matter which size I use they all fall out of my ears on a regular basis. The Left AirPod battery drains faster than the Right one. Even with noise cancellation turned off I only seem to get 3-4 hours of use between charges. Perhaps if you do not use AirPods as intensively they’ll work well for you. The sound quality is good and the noise cancellation works well enough but it also causes the AirPod battery to deplete faster. I miss corded ear buds.', \"Our son had wanted these Air Pods for a long time. When he finally got them, he was NOT disappointed. Just like other Apple products, these Air Pods are GREAT quality and durable. You can feel how well-made they are when you hold them. They are a bit heavier than typical wireless ear buds. We were surprised at how long the charge on the battery of the air pods lasts.  And our son likes the slick feel and fit of the Air Pods. We'd definitely purchase these again!\", 'I bought these as a graduation gift and I wasn’t disappointed. As soon as we open the case, my wife’s iPhone instantly connected. The sound quality and the noise canceling is awesome, the noise canceling gently fades in and out. Battery life is impressive, especially since you can either charge the case separately or charge the buds inside. We use a Qi charger so it’s fast. Also, these do not fall out while running, biking or working out!!', 'I said I would never buy expensive earbuds, but I got sucked in by the price one night and impulse bought these. Boy I am glad I did. Clarity with music and phone, easy Bluetooth connection with the phone and TV. Just a good all around product. Noise cancellation comes in handy for sleeping  and will try them soon on a plane.', 'I purchased the used AirPods for $147 and could’ve bought new ones for $189 but saving that money helps and they came I. Almost perfect condition besides having the small ear tips on they were great but just swapped them for the medium ones which were in there and very happy w the purchase.', 'Works well when it does work. Maybe it needs more software updates but it has issues when on a call for a long period of time. It eventually just stops doing noise cancellation or transparency mode on one ear and mutes my voice. The only way to fix the issue is to place the pods back in the case and basically restart them. It’s annoying when in the middle of a call while working. Also if you have transparency mode on while something creates high noise levels it starts glitching with the noise that comes through and starts doing noise cancellation. Needs updating for sure', 'I had my doubts about the airpods in general but after getting these for my wife i am blown away I got her the airpods and a set of beats solos for me and i honestly wish i would have gotten a set of these for myself Sounds quality is amazing Noise cancelling is next level Comfort Fit Antislip Everything is 10 stars Really impressed through and through Would recommend 100%', 'Doesn’t hurt your ear like the Powerbeats pro, and doesn’t fall off like the original AirPods. Sounds better more features .', \"I've personally never tried active noise cancellation before these. It's unbelievable how it blocks out the ambient noise. You sometimes don't even realize all the noise around you until you put these on. They are honestly worth every penny. Much better than my gen 2 AirPods.\", 'I purchased the prior version of apple’s AirPods for my hubby but they kept falling out of his ears so I bought these newer apple AirPods version which go inside the ear and he loves them. They don’t fall out of his ears and he loves the great sound quality. He mostly uses them while working out on his exercise bike which I’m very happy I was able to get them for him and at a great price. A win win!', \"I recently bought the Sony WF-1000XM3 noise cancelling earbuds (and then lost them :-( ) and most of the reviews say the Airpod Pros' sound is not as good as the Sonys - from my point of view the Airpod Pros are FAR better!!! In fact the APs are better in every way for me - better sound, better noise cancellation, smaller case, better fit, lighter. The Sonys just DID NOT WORK for phone calls (iPhone) - callers complained about poor audio on every call I made, so I stopped using them entirely for calls. I need to make more calls with the APs, but the integration to the iPhone is very tight, so I'm expecting good things (I have colleagues who live on the phone and say they work well?!). Buy the APs, you won't regret it!\", 'I have purchased 12 blue tooth ear pieces over the last 10 years. The last good ones was Apples AirPods, the first ones. They were good, but lacked noise canceling and batter life was just fair. So I used them each ear at a time. These, have much better battery life, noise cancellation and more controls. I like how it tells me who is calling when a call comes in. It also has easy controls.', 'I like these because they do not hurt my ear like the other AirPods did. However, these AirPods do not fit as securely as the others. I already lost the right AirPod when I was wearing it and wasn’t even aware, something that never happened with the old AirPods unless something brushed up against them to dislodge them. I am still playing around with the ear tips to find which one is best and will keep them because they do not irritate my ears.', \"I had the original AirPods and their battery life became unpredictable after several years so it was the perfect excuse to get these. Very impressed with the improvements. Feel like they fit more securely but actually, one fell out when I bent over to pick something up. Just have to be aware that that's a vulnerable move for me because they FEEL solid. Sound is great.  Love them.\", 'My lovely wife never used ear phones or any similar devices. I bought her the air pods and she is totally in to them. She loves them. If she has them on when I walk into the room, I need to establish eye contact with her before she knows I am even there.', 'My Apple AirPods Pro delivers excellent sound and, unlike the HomePod mini, was easy to pair with my other Apple devices.  The noise cancellation feature works as advertised, provided that you put an AirPod in each ear. The battery only seems to last 4 hours; wish it were longer so I could listen to TV all night without having to change from one AirPod to another.', \"The noise cancellation is incredible, and the sound quality is good. However, they don't stay in my ears as well as the regular air pods. I had to buy after-market tips to make them stay in my ears. They still do not feel as secure as the old ones, and it makes me nervous about doing anything strenuous like run or bike for fear of losing them.\", 'The sound quality not that great neither is noise cancellation and the most aggravating thing is they keep falling out of my ears. The battery life is horrible. Waist of money I am very disappointed in apple on this product and I own a lot of apple products which I am very happy with.', \"These are definitely not the best noise cancelling headphones out there but they work seamlessly with my Apple products and they sound great. My only real complaint is that no matter which size tips I put on, they don't stay in my ears snugly if I'm talking a lot or chewing.\", 'I was looking for a ear buds/head set to take calls (working from home) and listen to music. Was about to buy the Air Pods as they fit my requirements but decided to go pro in the last minute. The pro easily met my requirements and the noise calling feature is surprising very good; did not expect this level of noise cancellation from a tiny ear bud. The pro also fits snugly to the ear and have not fallen off during trail walking or regular gym activities. Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for noise cancellation without the bud and discomfort of a massive headset.', 'I love these. They make Google Meets and Zoom meetings much easier on my MacBook Pro. I open the charging case and take the earbuds out and they automatically connect. It reduces feedback and allows me to move away from my computer if I need to. It’s really changed the way I’ve been able to work. I can stand up, sit down, and be more mobile during virtual meetings. I would highly recommend them for this purpose alone.', 'Has the option of noise transparency, noise cancelation or off. Comes in SO handy. I lost a pod last time and literally had to buy these again. Sound quality is amazing. Ear wax doesn’t block sound like the first airpods. Recommend getting a case with them. I love this product. A must have.', \"The sound quality is very good, and the charging function is also powerful, so I don't need to charge all the time.  The active noise reduction function and spatial audio make me enjoy music perfectly.  The fit of the earphone is very good and will not make the ear uncomfortable unless it is worn all day. The play and stop control sensitivity on the headset is good.  It is very easy to operate with the mobile phone system.\", \"The first time I ordered the airpod pros, the ones I got were duds and would not connect no matter how long I charged them or what I did. So I returned them and got new ones the next day - and they work great! I'm so happy I made the jump. I have the high end Sony headphones that go over your ear, which also work great, but my son is starting distance learning so I gave those to him. I like that the airpod pros are smaller and I can use them in the car because my bluetooth speakers crapped out in my car. Lol anyway. really good product.\", 'Update after a year of use. Sound great. Pair seamlessly. Terrible for exercise. When you sweat they fall out of your ears!  I have had to puck one up off the pavement many times.

The style of the previous AirPods didn’t fit in my ear but these fit perfect and stay in The battery life is acceptable for the AirPods and the time they take to recharge in the Pod is quick. The noise cancellation works perfect.  While flying and working, having music or just silence is nice.', \"Lifetime Apple user. First time having airpods and what a disappointment. They worked like a dream for three months of light use and now I hear static on my end, and on the receiving end people tell me I keep cutting out and it's super annoying to them. Sent to Apple, and they returned and said everything was fine but I still have the same issue. Now I have an appt at the apple store. Basically spent several hours so far trying to resolve this. Apple support did say there was a manufacturing defect on airpods made between a certain date, and I'm thinking this is from that batch. I would have given up if this wasn't so expensive to last only three months.\", 'Great sound, crystal clear and active noise canceling was awesome. Wore them while mowing the lawn and it was like being indoors with closed windows and mower being a couple houses away. Connecting to an iPhone 11Pro was super easy. Only issue is that I would have liked more bass, still it is pretty good. Solid Apple quality, comes changeable inserts, cable and charging case...no power block.', 'I received these today. I purchased one that was used for a small percentage off. I expected some minor scratch on the case or something like that. Opened the shipping box, saw the inspected by amazon sticker. It was not. There were no silicone ear parts. And the charging cable is for an older Samsung. Charging cable isn’t an issue, I can’t really use them without the pieces that fit onto the earbuds.

Over the past week or so, in the left ear piece they have developed a echoing squeal with every movement I make and then every minute or so an annoying crackle. When I am still they are fine, but I purchased them for when I am walking and moving about the house. Unfortunately, I don't appear to be alone in this issue because I checked the internet for possible fixes; firmware, re-attaching, etc. and found others with the same issue. I have used Bluetooth earpieces {with the wire connecting them } prior to these and had no issues at a much less cost. Matter of fact, my wife is still using my old ones to this day. My experience.....\", 'I had the Bose Bluetooth ear buds and they were pretty big and bulky. Being so big, they had a tendency to fall out during running on a treadmill. I elected to buy these in hopes that they would stay out during my running on the treadmill. I am a bit of a sweater so ear buds have a tendency to always not want to stay in. These do not sounds quite as good as the Bose did but that was to be expected. The noise cancellation is pretty good. The battery case is way smaller than the Bose and I like that. Back to the fit, one of my Air Pod Pros does not like to stay in. I do have to constantly push it back in and refit it. That is a pain. This is probably just my ear though. Connection to any Apple device is a breeze. Like all Apple products, they just work. Would I recommend them? That is tough. I like them enough that I bought some for my wife for Christmas. I would have to say that I do recommend them and caveat that by saying I am hoping for some sort of ear clip that some aftermarket manufacturer will offer for these to ensure they stay in on my cardio workouts.', 'I was so excited to get these AirPod pros because of the noise canceling feature it wasn’t as good as I had hoped I could still hear my husband snoring. The battery life is terrible but I did like the fact it charges really quickly. The sound quality is mediocre needs more bass. I like that they connect to the Apple TV. They do stay nicely in my ears and they are quite comfortable.  I do use a tether to keep them together when I sleep with them so I don’t have to search for them in the morning if they fall out of my ears.', \"I'm a forever Samsung fanboy. But I gotta admit that AirPods Pro is the best noise cancelling earphone out there. There's no comparable product out there. It's comfortable to use, sounds great, and works well even on Android and Windows computers. I've been using it for listening to music and talking on Zoom calls. It simply works.\", 'This is the second apple earphones I am using. Before this I had one iPod nano and for some reason I feel that earphones had better surround sound or the 360 degree effect whatever you call it. But I must say they have really packed a lot of features in a small package. The noice cancellation is pretty decent. I wish the battery life were little better.', \"When they work... great dynamics, noise cancellation, battery life, convenient charging, and they stay in my ears fairly well. I've had mine for a year now, though, and intermittently they've had connection issues, making switching between Apple products difficult. They have improved this year a little, but there are still intermittent connection issues.\", 'I don’t understand the attraction to these things. Save yourself a ton of money and get the Mpower M30 Bluetooth wireless ear buds. They stay in your ear better, they look better, sound quality just as good and much cheaper. These things look ridiculous sticking out of people’s ears and I’m convinced it’s nothing more than for status.', 'I\\'ve bought two pairs of these now, and both developed the same bug. Sometime after about 8 weeks, the noise cancellation stopped turning on. The pods would not drop out of \"transparency\" mode into noise cancellation mode. Also on both pairs, the sound that indicates a change between modes stopped working. Both of these bugs were intermittent, but common, and would not go away all together after they first cropped up.', 'The first ear buds that have ever stayed in my ears without falling out. I like that you can use only one at a time. I’ve had the sound in transparency mode, so haven’t tested the noise cancellation. Battery life is great and recharges quickly. When using both buds and one falls out, the other bud stops playing alerting you to the fact that one has fallen out.', 'This are my second AirPods and now my last one. What are all the good sound worthy when they not connect well (with iPad and iPhone) and permanently dropping out of the war even when sitting calm on the desk. Tried all combinations they not stick. And if I go around and can only control volume at away phone. C’mon. Battery life is also below average. If you glue them to your ear and no need to control volume at 1 device only they would be best. Sound is good and noise cancellations is awesome. But this can’t compensate the disadvantages.', 'I waited for a while to pick these up, I waited for the price drop and purchase them. After using these I can never go back the noise canceling, the transparency mode, and the general sound quality is unmatched in headphones this size and at this price point', 'Having average sized ear canals, I wasn’t expecting any problem with these new AirPods. My previous AirPods fit my ears comfortably and for long periods of time. These started feeling uncomfortable in my ears at the hour mark. The slight improvement in sound is really not worth the uncomfortable feeling while wearing them. The sound blocking feature does work reasonably well for those who need it. I returned them.', 'I recommend buying these from the apple store. I bought these on Black Friday - which was a big mistake. I received them about a week later and they only worked for one day. I tried to return them to Amazon and they refused to replace them. Only give me a refund. I’m guessing this was because they were purchased on Black Friday and they probably sold multiple defective items. I ended up taking them to the Apple Store since they were still under warranty. They replaced the case for me since that was the issue. They told me they sold me a set that didn’t even work and was actually returned because the serial number was under someone else’s account... luckily I was able to prove I purchased them from Amazon themselves and not a third party store. If you want great quality airpods and not returned ones, definitely stay away from buying from Amazon.', \"these ones are difficult to decide, quickly, the convenience is really nice, switching from phone to watch to Mac is really nice, but the battery life is very short for my convenience, recharges relatively quickly , but still discharges really really fast. I'm giving it some time, may be the convenience is important , but if I have to switch to other headphones while they recharge, then this does not make sense\", 'While I’ve been enjoying the pros, there’s aspects I do not enjoy. The silicon tips can slide out of your ears if you are sweating (aka working out with them) and it can be annoying to constantly pop them back in. After a few months of ownership, I’ve heard weird rattling in them and occasionally have audio glitches where it shrieks in my ear. Other than that they’re good, love transparency mode and noise cancelling', 'Bought these air pod pros in Oct 2020 to be free of the tangling wires. However, more annoying than wires was the air pod pros falling out  no matter what what ear tip used though gave a lengthy trial for each tip.  No ear tip is best so far, they still fall out.  Just missed having them land in the paint bucket, bouncing off the footbridge into the creek, losing them in the snow etc.  Now the right is softer than the left (compared to my wire ear pods in which the volume is same in both ears.) doing an online search this problem of mine is not unique.', 'I purchased the Airpods Pro from this seller and a year later they no longer work. They no longer hold a charge let alone connect to any iphone. Truly disappointed since it was a gift for my husband and quite frankly embarrassing. I should’ve gone to the Apple store instead.', \"Just about perfect I love spacial audio it's like your in the movie theater noise canceling top of the line sound quality amazing but bass is not that great I would give bass a 7.9 fit is amazing I got the spin fits for them an they do not move at all battery is OK it could be better I get about 4 to 5 hours an I wish I was at 8 hours\", 'They’re cool, I like them, but they constantly stop playing in the middle of something if I yawn or move a certain way. I also hate how easy they fall out. Like when I’m doing yoga or cleaning around the house they constantly fall out of my ear it’s kind of annoying. For $200 I would expect them to at least stay in my ear if I’m walking. I do like they charge in the case', 'They refuse to stay connected to my phone for more than a 24 hour period, but even though I need to reconnect them (and rename them *the name is just listed as ‘Aa’ when it reconnects every day) they’re super convenient, super comfy to wear and the noise cancellation is so effing awesome when you’re busy. You don’t have to blast music to hear it over people talking too. So no deafening listening needed. 🤘🏻', 'I haven’t really noticed a huge difference in these and my older airpods. The ear cushions help for holding them in. In the infamous ignorance & Arrogance of Apple,,, they don’t come with a charger,,WTH. So if you don’t have a USB C charger,, your out of luck until you purchase one.', '2 months after I started using them, the right AirPod started making a weird beeping noise whenever the noise cancellation was turned on. the beeping was sensitive to any movement like moving my head a bit or walking. As this is a new feature for airpods, I am not surprised it has some flaws.', 'Alright. I have had these for a littler over a month. When I first got them they were great sound quality was good fit was good everything seemed great. One month later I can’t get a single pair of ear tips to pass the tip fit test. The right air pod makes a weird clicking sound for no reason. Transparency mode is muffled in the right ear and a lot of the time the air pods don’t charge unless I take it out of the case and put it back. Maybe these problems are only with mine maybe these 1st gen pros have faults? I don’t know. This is only my experience over the last month and couple days. I still highly recommend these the noise cancelling although not amazing works great and transparency mode is absolutely amazing.', 'I think in new age classic Apple fashion it’s a huge dud. For the price, the sound quality is okay at best. Neither one of the three tips fit my ear properly and constantly fall out while working out. It doesn’t pick up when it’s not in my ear well. I will acknowledge that the noise cancellation is better than I expected.', 'These are ok, for some reason my first package didn’t contain any AirPods and I suspect that the delivery driver took em and resealed the box. The sound quality is better than the original air pods but there isn’t a huge improvement. Sometimes they don’t connect when I put them in my ear. Noise canceling is ok and the active listening is ok but I still end up turning my music low. The surround sound is cool but sometimes in YouTube videos the sound gets shifted to only one side so you have to turn it off.', 'These Airpods have the same problems as the AirPod first version. The silicone does not stay in your ears properly if you are moving around. I’ve almost lost one several times. I have tried every sized silicone tip multiple times and they just never stay in tightly no matter how much adjust them or use the check the fit in settings. So disappointing. Returning.', \"Although I'm not a huge fan of Apple. This is the second ones I bought for my wife. She loves them the wireless charging is a bonus. Especially if you don't like having a lot of cables around. A 10 to 15 watt charger or any wireless device that does that amount of wattage. Seems to charge it sufficiently and quickly. Again it's Apple\", 'I had the original Airpods before these for 2 years until they died. I bought these hoping for a better experience and they’re terrible. More than half the time, only one decides to charge while the other one is dead, and I have no idea until I try to use them again. Even when I leave the case charging with them inside of it, one always manages to find a way not to charge. It’s very frustrating to go to use them and have only one work, especially for how much these cost. They also fall out of my ears way too easily. I never had either of these issues with the original ones. Honestly save your money and get the first gen.', 'These come with silicone ear buds that have 3 size options, small medium and large. I swapped down to small and they were still too big and kept falling out. Had to give them to my husband and go back to my old ones. Need xs earbuds to work for me or younger people', \"they gave me at hing to return them even though they sent me a pair that never worked right and the battery would not charge and nothing would help it. i had to leave town and didn't get around to sending them back so i got stuck w them. shocked me amazon would send out a refurbished pair that didn't work as well as new. very let down.\", 'Sound clarity is superb and the noise cancellation is above average.  The integration between other Apple devices is what made me love this pair the most. I considered a lower cost pair of wireless headphones since there are good quality ones out there.  What solidified my choice with the AirPod Pros was the microphone quality.  You just can’t beat is for a pair of wireless buds.  The call quality is clearer than any other pair on the market.', 'I bought this model for the noise cancellation and transparency modes plus the ear style.  It fits well and does what is expected.  I am having an issue with one piece not working.  I’m going to try one last recharge before exchanging them.  I’m tired of cords and want quality.', 'My AirPod pros stopped working after 5 weeks. 5 days after the Amazon exchange period and they would honor the exchange. Apple said I would have to send them off so they could repair them and would not allow an exchange. I recommend trying one by of the other earbud makers. I always paid the Apple premium for the excellent support, but that seems to be a thing of the past.', 'Pros: -Great quality. Beautiful look. Cons: -Very uncomfortable in the ear (even with the extra ear grips) -The noise cancellation is for you not to hear your surroundings not the person on the other end. If you’re driving or in a noisy place the person on the other end will hear it all.', \"Headphones would sporadically charge and the case was doing the same. They would say they were dead and 1 minute later they would be at 75% and the case was doing the same. Sound quality was alright. They were super uncomfortable in my ears. I tried all the ear adaptors. I like the old air pods better and they are honestly more fitting, although sound isn't that great. Not replacing, just returning because they don't charge right.\", 'Owned two of these, one of them had bluetooth connectivity issues but by taking to the apple store and doing a hard reset i believe it may have fixed the issue. I still have them so i will update later if it didn’t fix them. No update is good news. Cons: airpods pro on my pc are louder than with my iphone for some reason. The noise canceling was great and it became weaker but still effective. The mic is good for phone calls but not in my jeep. the wind noise are overwhelming for it. The regular airpods’ mic performed better in my jeep situation. Maybe because the mice is placed better on regular airpods. Pros: very very convenient for iphone users. Better than regular airpods in audio quality.  Better in everyway except mic in wind noise environment. Would definitely recommend but it needs to be perfected by a great update. All the issues that I mentioned could be fixed by a great update. So lets have it apple. Better noise cancelling like at first and a little louder please.', 'DO not use these if more than one device is connected to your apple account.  My family shred several devices all under one account.  ANY PHONE CALL MADE OR RECEIVED ON ANY DEVICE GOES TO THE HEADPHONES.  My wife is listening to music on her iPhone and I make a call from my iPhone and suddenly it’s in her ears.  Can’t be fixed, apparently.', \"I've had a hard time finding decent sounding earbuds. Sound quality is important. These are better then the expensive bose I have had for years. The noise cancelling is amazing. Didn't think ear buds could ever compete on that level with  headphones that actually enclose the entire ear. But when these kick in you can't hear any normal noise levels. Great product\", 'First time using headphones period in like 7 years. I needed something to have on me at all times for business. These work great, along with Apple Watch. I manage two phones and a family of 5 constantly and the AirPods make it easier. Way easier. I wish they had a “find my AirPods” connected to apple but, probably will soon.', 'Box came without airpod and the original package was no sealed !!! returning', \"No matter what I tried they wouldn't stay in my ears. They fell out while just sitting. I tried all three sizes of tips. The originals stayed in my ears without a problem. Sound quality was very good. And the noise cancellation was unbelievable. It was very disappointing.\", 'This is by far the best ear buds I\\'ve owned -- even better than the Bose Soundsports I own and reviewed.  There is no lag (none) when playing videos (i.e. Roku, Netflix, Prime, etc.) via your phone or home computer.  I cannot believe I waited this long to buy these.  Great for workouts as well, although they tend to occasionally slip out, but I suspect this can easily be fixed by purchasing \"wing tips\" or some other method.', 'I am really enjoying the pros. I have owned the original AirPods for 2 years and these are a great upgrade.The active noise cancellation is pretty neat you can long press the tactile buttons on each pod  to engage this feature or turn on the transparency mode. I recently used them in the office and it was able to drown out the drone of the HVAC system and people around my cubicle. Transparency mode is also helpful if you do need to hear things around you.', 'I had high hopes for these, as a potential replacement for my Bose noise cancelling headphones when traveling. VERY disappointed. First, the noise cancellation, when you can get it functioning, is laughable compared to the Bose. I would estimate about ⅓ the efficiency at cancelling ambient noise on airplanes, nowhere near adequate to promote relaxation in that environment. But most important, these things lose the iPhone audio connection all the time. Often the audio stream just stops, and you have to fiddle around to get it started again.  Or else the Bluetooth connection gets lost, or on the plane, where there are many other people with Bluetooth connected devices, the AirPods \"Pro\" just get confused about what they should connect to. Altogether a completely unusable product. (My wife and) I have tried multiple solutions to the audio disconnect issues as noted on the web, and nothing helps. Hopeless.', 'This 3rd generation of AirPods is much better than previous version in most ways. The Apple people finally realized that everyone has different size ear openings. If they had included memory foam tips also that would have been great. Sounds are improved over previous versions. Music finally has bass tones. I wish they would allow fine tuning by including a equalizer. I guess they’re waiting to charge us more later. These AirPods are better but still need much improvement.', \"They seemed to work fine, however they just did not feel good in my ears. After jogging with them and walking around the house talking on the phone my ear canal started to get really sore from them. I tried the various rubber pieces but it didn't matter. Hopefully there is a redesign or something later\", \"I've had these a few months and I use them almost every day.  I like everything about the AirPods Pro - the sound quality is excellent, battery life seems good so far, but I haven't really asked too much of it.  Charging is fast.  I use them when I'm gardening - hot and sweaty work, and they handle that just fine.  My ears aren't built like everyone else's apparently - I can't use ear buds unless they're 'in-ear' - the others just fall out, so that's my favorite feature!  Even at Apple prices, I have no regrets.\", 'Received counterfeit item. Item is a good fake in the sense that it will pop up on your fake as being legit. It’s the little things that will make you realize you have a fake. While using my Apple Watch the FAKE airpods will have trouble connecting to the phone.

If your in doubt bring your device to the Apple store for further examination. Mine was confirmed to be a fake.', 'I was skeptical after reading some of the comments posted here. They’re real & i love them. Verified them with Apple’s id numbers. Noise cancellation is the best I’ve seen of in ear headphones.  I have sweated all over these for months now. Still perform like they have since unboxing them.', 'Bought for my pilot husband, he says it is the best gift he never knew he wanted!!! The noise cancellation is fantastic, even for loud bars/restaurants. Really great sound quality The adjustable ear bud sizing is a game changer- they feel secure all the time Great battery life No regrets- just need to figure out how to upgrade my own :)', 'needs to adjust often to get good noise cancelling effect.  probably not the best fit for my ears.  sometimes the sound becomes more 3d (spatial?) for no reason when i listen to audiobooks, and the only way to get back to stereo is by playing music, stop the music, and get back to audiobook .', \"I am not big on tech, but my husband is so I finally splurged and got him the headphones he wanted. He has had Boose headphones before this and he liked them, but the cord easily gets damaged. We are an Apple household and I don't know why I was skeptical about the product and even though the price point is high they are worth the noise cancelling portion alone. Use for work, car rides while the kid is sleeping and on motorcycle rides. Great purchase!\", 'Distortions cracking noises in first pare Apple replaced with Apple Care a month later the ear pod repeats distortion noise with humming noises and heading back this weekend for another replacement', 'These had a horrible smell. After looking online, it seems like many people have this same issues. The AirPod tips smell like nail polish, and after days of airing them out and even soaking the tips in baking soda, the smell never went away. I’m disappointed, because the airpods themselves were really great, but I have an illness which makes me sensitive to strong smells like these.', \"Another amazing apple product that I am 100% satisfied with!

Besides that, everything else is fantastic!  The noise cancelling is unlike anything I have ever used.  The controls are easy to set up, and it will connect to multiple devices without issue.  Sound quality is awesome.  Could maybe use a little more bass, but that's a show stopper, they are tiny headphones.  The fit is pretty good as well.  It was worth the steep price tag compared to other models.\", 'Amazing noise canceling! I actually thought I blew a circuit breaker in my house, after I first put these in my ears ! I do not enjoy trying to get them out of the holder, the lid loves to shut during that process, but well built and they sound better than any blue tooth devices I’ve ever used !', 'I had the old air pods and they got into my ears fine. These seem to shift and move around when I have them in and talking. I’ve tried all the different sizes that comes with the set but they just don’t feel as secure. I love the noise cancellation and ability to click to stop/start but I also tend to lose connection quite a bit and I’m not exactly sure why. Not my favorite apple product for sure.', \"Magnificent. I had AirPods (non-Pro) and they had trouble detecting insertion into my right (but not left) ear from day one. These do not have that problem. And in both ears they attach to my iPhone Xs basically instantly upon ear insertion. No delay. It's amazing. I have no further need for my three-hundred-dollar Bose QuietComfort 35 over-ear headphones. None. These AirPods Pro are incredible.\", \"Although some may find it expensive, I recently upgraded from the 1.0 Apple Earpods and I am glad I did. All around it is just a better earpod from the clarity, noise cancellation ability, and they just feel more snugly fit. I like the noise transparency feature. It is convenient so you don't have to remove your pods to hear your surrounding. Also, I can finally wirelessly charge them on a Qi charger. I gave away my old 1.0s to my sister and I don't regret upgrading.\", \"After a couple of months of owning these one of the AirPods started making a weird clicking sound. Apple sent a replacement and the issue was fixed. Now, the issue occurred again (only two months later).

AirPods Pro seem to have persistent issues and it is not worth buying them considering Apple's poor return policy.\", 'Don\\'t buy these. I did and I regret it. I missed out on buying a better pair on Prime Day because I was giving these pieces of garbage a shot. I tried numerous different ear sizes and even got \"upgraded\" aftermarket ones, still garbage.

As someone who has purchased 5 pairs of ‘budget’ earbuds in the last 2 years, I decided to go all out. And it was worth it.

So, I have my airpods in, hair covering them, and noise cancellation on. I can hear the conversation perfectly, and the loud music is barely detectable. Perfect solution.', 'We had got the product on Amazon couple of days before travelling out of the country. I was using a regular AirPod (which I gave to someone, since the new one arrived). The packing was in good condition, the product on the outside looked good too. But unfortunately, the left earpiece makes a constant ticking sound. I looked it up online, and others have also complained of it. Guess we were one of the unlucky ones. I personally preferred the sound that the Airpod had compared to Pro - it must be the noise cancellation effect.', \"My husband bought these for my birthday. I never wanted airpods because I just didn't want to spend the money for what I thought would be regular headphones without wires. The noise cancellation is amazing sometimes when my 1-year-old starts throwing a temper tantrum I just put the headphones without music in my ears just to minimize the noise. My husband was loving the features to so the most her gave me for my birthday, I used some of it to get him some here on Amazon. I was skeptical at first but they work amazingly well too.

I got these on sale and they were worth the price but I’m not sure I would be as happy if I had payed full pricing for them.', \"I was trying to decide between the Apple AirPods Pro and the PowerBeats Pro, and ultimately decided to invest in the AirPods. Having not had luck with Apple earbuds in the past - giving me sore ears, falling out, etc. - I was hesitant, but reviews convinced me otherwise. And I'm very glad I purchased these. I've used these earphones for exercising (both cardio and weights), working from home, and for various phone calls. I have yet to experience these earphones falling out. I really love the added feature that allows you to check how secure each earbud is, and that the fit is customizable. I don't anticipate any problems with them falling out in the future, nor having any pain from prolonged use. The sound quality is also great. Not as strong of a bass as I've experienced with previous headphones I've owned (e.g. Beats), but still great sound overall. And the phone call audio is also very clear. No complaints so far. Very happy with my purchase.\", 'The AirPods Pro have performed in every regard as both advertised and as expected.  The only issue I had was with the right Pod which after 4 months quit recharging beyond 23% yet did not function either to use up that 23%.  I had to make two calls to Apple to seek help with the problem.  The first lasted over an hour and a half with most of it on hold and the woman who eventually took my call was completely incompetent and had no idea what she was doing.  I got no satisfaction and eventually just hung up in frustration.   The next day I placed another call, quickly got a very helpful person who quickly assessed that my product was in fact defective, my 1 year replacement was active and a replacement Pod was appropriate.  She completed the necessary confirmation and set the wheels in motion.  Two days later I received the replacement right Pod and returned the defective one in the provided mailer.  Problem solved and all has worked well since then.', \"These are nice earbuds, they sound great, good sound cancellation and the spatial sound feature is awesome.

They will say connected in the bluetooth settings and make the sound indicating they connected, but then no sound whatsoever will play through them from my computer.

I've had them for a couple weeks now, and the different listening settings alone have blown my mind. I have used the Transparency, Off, and Noise Cancellation settings for different situations and, so far, have no complaints. Unfortunately, my right ear doesn't hold the AirPod in if I get sweaty from working out, and I've had both fall out alternatively as I got sweaty, but honestly, the sound makes up for it. I do wish there was a way to skip a song or change the volume within the AirPods themselves, but they're already so small and sleek, so I can't really complain. They're worth purchasing in my opinion.\", 'Absolutely amazing! I had not tried a pair before purchase and was blown away by these AirPods. Noise cancellation is supreme, while transparency mode enhances your surroundings. It’s almost like enabling HD audio but for life lol, the sound quality is top notch with heavy bass and clear highs. Batteries lasted an entire day of listening to music while working outside. I expect over time for the operational time to drop but still impressive. Seamless integration with iPhone and Siri. I show them off to my friends and they are amazed as well. Apple has produced a fantastic product with these AirPod Pros.', \"I've tried all three sizes of silicone tips.  I've rotated them every way except backwards.  NOTHING I try will keep these things in my ears. They offer outstanding sound, but what good is that if they fall out and get lost, or go down the drain, or worst. Very disappointed.  They truly do sound good, but I have no use for them if they are not going to stay put. Contacting Amazon to return.\", \"These AirPods are simply amazing. The noise cancellation works surprisingly well. The recharge in/by their case is delightful. The fit test on one's iPhone is ever so helpful. One needs to get tips on how to set up and use. Once you have the tips, you can master the AirPods. I like the ability to create and send a text message with Siri as well as make phone calls. These manage that very nicely. I highly recommend these.\", 'I found the best ANC earbud. I needed an ANC earbuds. This was shown the best performance for the ANC function which really needed. I am using this for 4 months, I am so satisfied using this item. This was a good choice and I want to buy this to my friends and mu family too. I can recommend this Airpod pro to the people who want the ANC function especially. Score => sound: 4/5, battery life: 2/5, Bluetooth with multiple devices: 0/5, Active Noise Cancelling: 5/5, Comfortableness in the ear: 5/5', \"I've never had a set of buds that included active noise cancellation before, and I had my doubts as to their effectiveness. Turns out it works great. Sure, they're not quite as good as the over the ear active noise cancelling headphones I've used, but that's to be expected. They are better than I thought they'd be though. And transparency mode is fantastic.\", 'I like most things about the AirPods Pro, but I can’t listen to spoken material; the sound is so muddy that I can’t understand what people are saying. The ‘equalizer’ does pretty much nothing, it very much needs an actual 5 or 7 band equalizer. Typical Apple. I find that the wired Apple Earbuds have a much better sound for me than these. Likely these will be returned if Amazon will allow it.', 'owned for 1 month and the left earbud doesn\\'t hold a charge anymore.. Of course there is a process to get this fixed with in the first year, but now I need to \"schedule\" and appointment with the Geek Squad as Apple Stores aren\\'t open in AZ. 2 weeks wait for an appointment. Come on Apple, product is less than a month old, send me new ones, i\\'ll send you the ones that don\\'t work. I really expected better quality from Apple on this one and an easier process to fix an issue that is clearly a Mfg defect.', \"Very easy to use and comfortable fit.  Not likely to fall out.  Noise cancelling is effective and has an option to allow ambient noise for when you don't want noise cancelling.  Battery life is more for occasional phone calls or other short intervals.  I use them for class and charge in between.  Expensive, so I'm sure there are other options that work just as well.\", 'Worth the purchase if you are an Apple user. They sync’d instantly. You can change the sound modes so easily and quick. They sound awesome. I get my text messages read to me and can even reply with my buds in. I think the case is sturdy but you definitely want to get a protectant cover just like any other expensive Technology purchase.', 'Sound quality:  Whatever my studio speakers and pro headphones sound, they sound. Airpods first and second gen sucked big time but the Pros are amazing. Fitting: I have no problems at all so far. They stay in my ears without problem. I read that some reviewers having problems holding them in place, but if one person  in a 1000 people cant hold it in ear, then the problem is not the Airpods. Active noise cancellation: first of all when it is off you can talk on the phone or listen music while can still hear the surroundings. Great feature specially when you drive. Now turn ANC on and let the magic happen. It is such a weird felling. Battery life: I squeeze easily 4 hours. the case can hold up to 20 plus very fast charges. I was too skeptical giving that amount of money for a pair of in ear headphones, but the technology the build quality and the sound quality is worth every penny.', 'Messed around with lesser products before committing. Should have just gone with these from the beginning. Convenient, sound good, battery lasts. Have to go Pro as the regular apple ear phones are worthless for my ear shape, they fall right out no matter what.', 'I loved these so much that I bought a second pair for my husband to replace his Beats. They’re comfortable and stay put while you’re working out. I’ve had zero issues with them falling out while lifting or running on the treadmill. Easy to clean and easy to charge.', 'Please do yourself a favor and watch a couple how to use videos on the web to see all the features and how to customize to your preferences.  The active noise isolation is a typical example.  Activate it and amazing.  Yes these are expensive and high quality alternatives might is better, however if you want the Apple total integration with all your devices this is for you. Now I want a pair!', \"I own 6 wireless earphones and these are hands down the best - and its not even close.  These are lightyears better than Apple's own Powerbeats Pro wireles set.  They are better for many reasons, my 2 fav reasons are the fit and the earpiece to earpiece connectivity - no static or cutting out.  No strange behavior like left one working right one not.\", 'I gave 3 stars not because they are not good but because one does not work. I was happy to pay less but you always pay the price when you buy used things. I guess there is a reason that these are used and returned. My left AirPod turns on and off all the time so I will definitely return and think twice if I will buy again. They are definitely good quality if they work.', 'My Apple AirPod Pro\\'s cancel noise as well as any of the top rated full ear cover head phones.  And yet they fit in your pocket for convenience.  Highly recommend this product.  I have tried many \"ear buds\" but none had the noise canceling and sound quality that these do.  And, they don\\'t fall out during a sweaty run or workout.  Very much enjoy this high quality product and use them almost every day.', \"The auto switching feature is still very buggy but the sound and noise cancelling is very good. I run into bugs when using these for phone calls as well (random drops or device switching mid-call). I would recommend these when they are on sale for under $200 if you have an iPhone.  If not, Samsung's earbuds may provide better value for you.\", 'Sound quality, bass, significantly worse than Earpods (with wire) and lightly worse than regular Airpods. On top of that not very comfortable - my ear canals were irritated after 10 or so minutes. The noise cancellation feature is very good, but overall not worth over $200. I bought regular Airpods and I am much happier.', 'Well if you’re looking at these you’re looking at the right product, I use them every single day, for music , YouTube,& talking on.  I’m not one of those guys who is gentle on electronics , I’ve dropped them stepped on them,& everything in between.  They connected to all my Apple stuff without effort, if I’d lost, or finally broke them, I’d order a new pair tomorrow!!', 'Absolutely love these. Upgraded from my version one AirPods and these are significantly better. The sound quality is great, the noise cancelling is unbelievable and they sit comfortably in my ears. They come with 3 different sizes of rubber ends for various ear sizes to ensure a good fit. The battery lasts a real long time as well. Definitely worth the upgrade.', 'These are great! Easy to charge! Fits my ears perfect! The sound quality is A-amazing! What a difference in sound quality then the corded version. Highly recommend you splurge the money for a great sound experience and no more wires to jerk out of your ears!', 'I have small ears and I usually have trouble keeping headphones on my ears for more than 5 minutes (unless they attach around the ear like the beats). These headphones are really comfy and crystal clear with amazing sound quality. I would say that I am not all that impressed by the noise-canceling - I can still hear sounds around (granted, much less than on traditional headphones). It is perfect if you use them to speak on the phone or attend online meetings.', 'I was kinda skeptical about buying these on Amazon but the price was lower than any other company so I took a chance.  They are awesome!! The sound quality is unbelievable! The silicone ear pieces are very comfortable and make buying the pros worth the money.', 'I had Airpod Gen 2s and they did not stay in my ears. I bought these to stay in my ears and thought they would be different but have since fell out of my ear regularly. One fell out while I was riding my scooter and was run over by a car so I had to spend $96 more for a replacement!', 'Sad to say that I actually prefer my old AirPods than the pro. It’s not as comfortable and as user friendly as the old design. It does have great battery life compared to the older version. My old AirPods battery life started to suck after 2 years of using it. The AirPods Pro lasts about 5 hours straight while my old AirPods only lasted me about <3 hours.', 'overall good quality sound and design.  Bending over was a problem for me, regardless of the size ear plug adapter they were prone to fall out.  In three days, probably fell out 10 times, doing regular household chores and working out. I returned them, will hope for better luck with the next version in 2022', \"I had the expectation that these AirPods were something special. I was extremely disappointed when I realized they didn't work any better than the cheaper ones I already had that only cost $39. Additionally, they would fall out of my ears very easily. I returned them for a refund.\", 'An incredibly small a gigantic sound machine.  I could not believe my ears when I first connected these earPods with my iPhone.  Previously I was using German Sennheiser noise canceling earphones.  These beat Sennheiser hans down.  The new silicone ear pieces are not only comfortable but they fit snugly for a perfect noise cancelling job.', 'I don’t know who these came from or if it was a secondhand reseller. But I have been trying to return these for the past 3 months. I reached out when I first got them, within the week I bought them. They were malfunctioning and I couldn’t understand why because I thought they were brand new. I have had an iPhone since 2018! I have never had any problem with my phone and I went from an 8plus to an 11 to a 12 pro max. I am very disappointed because this is not what I paid for. I strongly believe that I was sold a product that was never supposed to be sold as in a REJECT pair!', 'I am a music lover, I love to dance and I love to dance with headphones. That being said I have danced with and tried my fair share of headphones. These are my favorite so far. First of all, they dont fall from my ears and they feel super secure in there. Second, the volume is great. 3. The noise cancelling is great. It can cancel someone snoring next to you.', \"Bought when on sale and similar price to regular airpod to try.  Actually one of the few apple products I'm very disappoint on.  Good for those who want the tight ear fit for noise cancelling but the regular airpods are much more comfortable in the ear.  I use these as a back-up but primarily use my regular airpods.\", \"100% Fakes ....... The touch functionality doesn't work at all and the box didn't even come with adapter! Right airpod stopped working. 100% fakes. DO NOT BUY. I’m waiting on a new set if those also don’t work I will be returning for a full refund\", 'Product is great BEFORE it BROKE. One of the AirPods no longer works...it broke for no discernible reason in less than 3 months. Even more frustrating, HUGE RUNAROUND when trying to get it fixed or replaced. Even though submitted request weeks ago STILL NOT RESOLVED. For $250, shouldn’t break, SHAMEFUL the way vendor handled and INEXCUSABLE that won’t fix or replace in a reasonable amount of time...after almost a MONTH no movement, still have broken AirPod and no ETA when this will be resolved.', \"Product worked amazing for an year and then ran into some quality issues, when I took them to the Apple store to get them fixed I found out they were fake!! I was shocked, the pair I had looked and sounded authentic (before the issue). Be careful people, I trusted this product based on the reviews and with Amazon being such a well known company but can't trust anything to be real these days. The counterfeit item had a copied serial number of an authentic pair and came in a standard Airpod Pro Box with all accessories.\", 'Had a great deal on these. They were on sale plus I had credit card points a use for these. The sound quality is great and I love how are you can test them for a proper ear fit. The noise cancellation isn’t quite as good as my Bose headsets but they are more comfortable. And they also do Stay put in my ears. Another great product from Apple', 'Best headphones I have had so far.  Great fit, awesome sound quality!  I especially love the noise cancellation setting.  I can mow the grass now and hardly even notice a lawnmower sound!  Highly recommend this product.  Very satisfied!  Not uncomfortable to fall asleep in while listening to your meditations in the background.  Wait to purchase when they are on sale, but worth the investment!  I also got the two year protection plan!', 'Everything about Airpods pro is top class. I did had issues with sound rattling with use and a short trip to Apple store took care of it. They replaced it twice. Earphones have top class transparency mode and sound quality as well as noise cancellation. I have multiple noise cancelling headphones and earphones but this one takes the trophy.', 'Wow. I was a bit skeptical of the additional price for these headphones as I already had a pair of the original AirPods. After some recommendations from coworkers I decided to buy them. Boy am I glad I did.  The sound is amazing, I don’t know if the adaptive EQ works a, but I do know that music sounds excellent through them. The noise cancelling exceeded my expectations for such a small device.  Buy a pair ... you won’t regret it.', 'Exactly one month after the return window  closed it is no longer pairing, resetting and it is pretty much dead weight. Sound quality was ok, noise canceling good, battery bad as it degraded significantly in one month use and wouldn’t last 3 hours. Shouldn’t cost more than $40 for what it is. Ear tip is uncomfortable at best, aftermarket foam tips make it bearable.', 'This review probably would have been much better because I really did like the sound clarity and quality. However, the right earbud started with static that was unbearable. I did get a hold of someone and they are sending a return box to hopefully get replaced. I’ve only had these three months and have barely use them so hopefully this isn’t a thing.', 'I had the standard air pods and thought these would be a lot better for the money.  They are not.  Two big differences 1) the noise cancellation, which is good 2) Advancing to the next song on the pros is not as easy as the standard air pods - if you are a runner and you like to tap your ear to move to the next song, get the standard ones.  While the pros have the advance feature with tap, you have to hit it in a specific spot otherwise it will not move forward.  Definitely not worth the extra money.', \"I had the original air pods and decided to upgrade after several years. The transparency mode is worth the new pair alone - I can walk my dogs and hear cars, other people, bikers, all while still being able to hear my music. Worth the price for that alone - as a woman, it's great being able to be aware of my surrounding. They also stay in my ear much better than the original air pods. Noise cancelling mode is really good for work too.\", 'Before purchasing, please be aware that the AirPod Pro earbuds have a known defect that develops over weeks or months. One or both develop a rattling sound when you move your head that becomes an annoying buzzing sound when you speak. I have had to order replacements four times from Apple only now to be told they will no longer send replacements by mail with a return label for the defective earbuds. At this point I’m throwing in the towel and going to purchase Sennheisers. I’m tired of the hassle and their new policy that will mean I won’t have earbuds for over a week.', \"I love these Air Pod Pro's.  They can cancel out my lawnmower to the point where I can turn down the volume of my headphones.  They are also great at the gym.  I did purchase some AHA ear hooks to ensure a good fit.  It wasn't absolutely necessary, but I have confidence that they will not fall out 100%.\", 'Bit the bullet and splurged on these air pod pros...UNFORTUNATELY...I was Badly Disappointed! The noise cancelling is pretty good if you don’t mind the negative pressure effect (like change in elevation does to your ears). The best feature in my opinion is Siri reading your msgs to you. The big issue is the darn things just do not stay in my ears. The silicone tips create a seal in your ears when you  insert them but that only lasts a few minutes. Hopefully my opinion will help those thinking of splurging on these.  I have returned them for a full refund and will go with the power beats pro, may lose a bunch of features but at least they will stay put when in my ears. I would not recommend the AirPod pros to anyone which is hard for me to say because I love apple products. Airpods 2gen were great and I totally recommend them over the pros.', 'These AirPods Pro are really great. Excellent noise cancelling and transparency mode is amazing. The best is that they automatically switch devices to whatever you are using at the time in the apple ecosystem. Say I’m listening to music on my iPad Pro, then my phone rings. I answer my phone and my AirPods are connected to my iPhone. Sound quality is what you expect at this price range as well. You are going to want to buy memory foam ear tips though, the silicone tips don’t stay in my ears that well.', 'I liked AirPod pro design but the fit is terrible and they don’t stay in place. Apple this is a horrible product.  They feel as if your ears are clogged and then you have to constantly adjust them every minute or they will fall out.  The AirPods keeps going from off to transparency mode and constantly disconnecting. I did also dislike le the tactic button o rather the tap. These are being returned and getting AirPods 2 instead.  I had AirPods 1 st generation and never had these issues.', \"I didn't want to plunk down the money for these, but I needed noise cancellation. I did exhaustive research on youtube trying to find cheaper ones but these come out on top a lot. They're super nice and I forget they're even in my ears. I just ordered the silicone stabilizers to make sure they're more secure and the memory foam replacement tips so I'm sure to block out sounds of loud equipment I use during the day.\", 'I didn’t like these earbuds. They don’t fit securely into my ears. They feel like they’re always about to fall out, regardless of the size ear piece I use.  Sound canceling is ok, not great. The battery life stinks. For the cost, these are awful. Many many better brands out there. The one good thing is they pair instantly, but that’s not enough to justify the price.', 'I would have sent them back! The original ones at least stay in my damn ears! Ugh! Both have fallen out over a sink full of water and everywhere else for that matter! I have to constantly keep checking them to make sure they are in my ears. Very poor design and the battery does not last like the originals. Hate is a strong word but I do hate them.', \"Unfortunately, I had to regift them after having only used them for less than a week. I ended up with Swimmer's ear. I didn't even know that existed until I was having trouble hearing and in pain and went to urgent care. Apparently, not fully drying my ears after washing my hair caused it because I do not swim nor exercise. After googling the issue I am not the only one who has experienced this painful issue. I am very content with my previous generation of Airpods.\", 'I was skeptical that there would be a considerable difference between the standard and pro edition, but I was proven wrong within the first five minutes. Nearly aspect of these are an improvement from the sound quality, ease of use and especially the noise cancellation. My only complaint is how the stem of the AirPods now require a squeeze instead of the former tap. Maybe it’s because I was so used to it and started to enjoy smacking myself in the ear to stop my music, but it is definitely a different feeling. Overall, my complaints are from personal preference and nothing with the product itself, this is a wonderful product and I have no doubts in my purchase.', 'My issue is with the bluetooth connection outside. I bought these to use while I run with my cellular apple watch and had serious connection issues that I never had with even my cheaper $30 ear phones. Please be aware of this before purchasing. Inside my home was not an issue. I had to send them back as much as I would hoped that they would work out!', \"These were SUCH disappointment!!! I could hardly hear the calls and the battery life is a joke compared to the 124 dollar ones!! So 😥  I ended up giving them to my kid. I'm a postal worker and really need my tunes as I walk 45,000 steps a day!!!  Reordered the older ones as my first pair went thru the wash. My fault I know but thats why I ended up upgrading.  So disappointed.  . .\", \"This is a dynamite product. I didn't think I would ever buy these since I don't like sticking things in my ears but I bought them when they went on sale. These are really great for traveling on a plane or sitting in the airport. I won't have the long cables connecting them to my iPhone anymore.\", 'They are very unstable. They frequently do not connect to the iPhone and they lose connection easily. It is frustrating to try to reconnect them. They don’t fit well in the ears. But when they do connect, the sound quality and noise canceling is good.', \"Overall, Airpods Pro are great.  They are lightweight, have good sound quality and hold a good charge.  However, I have still not gotten used to the Active noise cancellation feature.  When this feature is activated, I feel a lot of pressure in my ear and it doesn't go away until I turn it off.  Otherwise, I am happy with this purchase.\", 'Upgraded from first generation AirPods and what a difference. Great battery life, fast connection and noise cancellation available when you need.', 'I upgraded from the original AirPods and I really like these! I am not a headphone pro but I use these for work and they work great.  They work seamless with my apple products. Only complaint I have is if I take them out of the case when I’m in my car, they take over the audio from my Apple Car Play... first world problems.', 'First of all they never worked. It favored the sound of things happening in the background so my voice was heard as distant for the person I talked with. There is also not enough research about the harm these wireless headphones have on our brains.', 'I found these to be uncomfortable to wear longer than 30 minutes.  The sound was good, however, the noise cancellation was just okay, not great.  I bought these to wear all day as I work, but had to return them because they were no good for that purpose.', 'These fit and feel so-so, but likely still better than regular Air Pods. Also, no volume adjustment on them, just via whatever app your using and in Teams, which is what I use these for most, you have to go into settings to adjust volume. Other than that, I really like these.', \"Sound quality and volume is great! It's my first pair of AirPods, so I don't have a comparison. Only reason I gave four stars is because I'd like to be able to control volume and have other customizable settings like other ear buds have (Bose + Jabra). Otherwise, I'm thrilled with them. Battery holds charge for long periods of time. Pods charge fast. Fit quite well, and I have small ears.\", \"Finally APPLE has listened. I can finally use Apple EarPods that don't fall out of my ear, or cause my ears to hurt from the plastic. I use these daily for about 5 hours and I absolutely buy them again. I work with them, gym, drive, sleep with them. They awesome. They are pricey but they are worth it. Don't hesitate people they are a huge upgrade from the originals.\", 'They’re okay for what they are.  You’re trading sound quality and comfort for ultralight portability.  I use these for trail running.  I’ve tried all of the sizes of changeable rubber plugs that come with them, and there’s no secure fit for intense sports.  Be prepared for these babies to pop out at some point.', 'As far as music quality, noise cancellation, and battery life, the new AirPods are great but there is much left to be desired for audio quality when making phone calls and ear security. These DO NOT stay in your ears if you are moving around. I bought them for the sole purpose of working out and they come loose with any type of up and down motion. I am constantly pushing them back into my ears and terrified that they are going to fall out and break or plunge into a sewer grate never to be seen again. If you are getting these for causal listening at your desk, it’s a great product. If you are planning to use them for any type of active lifestyle, I would stick with the original ones.', 'Have had original air pods for awhile now & decided to try out the Pro upgrade-absolutely great decision! Sound so much better. Had to turn old ones all the way up & constantly adjust them-not the Pro-they fit perfectly & are just awesome. Get them at this great price while you can 😎', 'Was very keen to get them. Was very disappointed to use them: (1) the hermetic full seal creates an ugly \"thump\" when you walk/run, completely unbearable, (2) the airplane mode is oppressive, a common feature to airplane modes, really useful only on an airplane but otherwise a pain, literally, (3) the aware mode doesnt resolve 1 and 2 above at all, (4) worst of all, they are larger than the old ones, and fit so tight that i experience a pain after 20-30min. Gave them to my wife who likes them, so perhaps not a universal set of objections, but still, relevant for some if not many.', 'I’ve had this AirPods for about a month now, it’s is not what I expected I still have the older one and I think it’s better, the rubber supposedly to prevent it from falling , yet it keeps falling off my ears ( I tried all 3 sizes), also there is static every time I’m on a call, the most bothering issue is the size , too small and keep falling off my pocket , so if your not using zipped pocket you will lose them. Good thing is the pod will charge the ear pieces 3 times in full per one full charge.', 'Glad I went with the Pro air pods. Very comfortable and you can’t beat the noise cancellation feature. They stay in place fairly well. I like to wear just one pod at work. The recharging case is great to have. Seemed expensive until I actually started using them almost daily. Worth the price now.', 'The only downfall is, they only work with Apple Mac or Apple iPad.  Will not work with digital keyboard or Samsung cell phone.  The product for Mac and ipad is wonderful, the range is good and the sound superior.  If you have Apple products these earpods are perfect.', 'I read plenty of reviews both pro and con before I went to the bank to take out a loan for these babies! Yes, they cost a lot but in my humble opinion, I’m glad I made the jump. I keep my old style iPods  around (the house) to use in places where falling out of my ears is not a problem. I like the much better sound these produce. They don’t replace my hearing aids, but then I really didn’t expect them to. Only hoping.', \"As an intensive user, I'm disappointed. This product is way below Apple's quality and reliability. Only 1 out of 4 pairings of both pods work the first on the first attempt. Sometimes only one pod gets connected; sometimes, you need 3-4 retries, back and forth to the case before it can be used properly. I had 2 cycles of replacements wasting tons of time with Apple's support trying to go through useless resets and reconnects.\", 'I received a pair and they didn\\'t work out of the box.  Amazon did the right thing and sent out a replacement pair right away. Those worked, but when I paired it with my phone it came up as \"Mom\\'s Airpods\" which suggests to me this was a return/refurbished/used.  These are advertised as new but at this great price, I suspect the lot being sold here are not. Great product obviously but at 2 for 2, I am suspicious of this lot.', 'I had a problem with mine and had to return them.  Amazon replaced them and the new ones have been perfect.  I love how small and portable they are. However, I want to note that I think the PowerBeats Pro sound WAY better IMO and I use them for working out and when I really want to focus on the music. For casual use and as a phone earpiece, these are fantastic.', 'The sound quality and features are nice. However, the pods will not stay in my ear.  It falls out not only when I am exercising but when I am sitting or just walking or cleaning.  I have tired all three sizes for the rubber tips and it will loosen up after a few minutes and I can feel it slipping out.  I would say the Pros are not really worth the money. I like the previous version better.', \"If you're looking for wireless earphones and you're already down to spend around $250. Just stop wasting your time and buy this, they work with both Apple and Android. Noise cancellation stops the peasants from annoying you. Sound quality keeps you leveled. Battery life makes you happy. Just buy it, you can always return if you don't like it. Now gimmi my helpful vote pwease\", 'Not sure if it was an authentic product. Arrived broken and it got a lot worse now. The left AirPod looses battery in minutes and the service rep tells me that since it is only cover by limited warranty, I might have to pay for the repairs. It’s been only 4 months and even though it was broken when it arrived, I couldn’t process a return within 30 days of the purchase date thinking Apple values their customers.', 'They do not work at all, I bought them brand new and immediately had problems connecting them to my iPhone 12 Pro Max. They would connect and disconnect dozens of times in the space of 10 minutes. When they finally connected for any length of time, I could listen to Apple Music for like one third of a song before they would lose connection. I am so tired of this crap, I reluctantly put my faith into Apple years ago and with over-priced flashy junk like this, I am strongly considering switching to competitor products. I am going to return this junk, what a waste of money, time and hope.', \"I love these!! The battery life is about 4.5 hours, so I have to charge then after some use.

They don't block out all of it, so some does get through, but it is muted.\", 'I’ve had the older generations of these apple airpods and They never fell out of my ear.

They drown out the noise for me so that I can focus on my calls. I also use them when I go to the store. Tiny, crying children seem to find their way to me no matter where I go, and these have been a god send in that regard. Same with airplanes...those tiny, crying children are less disruptive, as are the people that eat chips like their life depends on it.', 'One of the best bluetooth earbuds out there. The Active Noise Cancellation works well. Touch controls are easy and simple. Even though I use a Galaxy S9+, the Airpods worked very well. I had to use third party apps to make sure I get to use all the features that came with it. The one bad thing that annoyed me was the ear tips. As comfy as they are I am constantly pushing them back into my ear every other minute or else they fall out. I had to return them though because after a week or two, I realized I had just spent $220 to listen to music.', 'At this time there is no fix regarding this design flaw. When noise-cancellation or transparency mode is turned on, a rattling clicking sound shows up whenever you move, but all is well when mode is off. Very annoying. Not worth the $230 price tag.', 'First, I had doubts because the first AirPods could not fit in my ear and I bought all the add-on you can buy and nothing. Apple finally got it right THANK YOU for considering customers who had trouble with your first version. Love them sound good although sound cancellation is good I have to tip my hat a little to Amazon ear buds they seem to have the notch on that one. Overall if you can get them I would highly recommend but if you want something for less the Amazon’s earbuds come definitely a must buy.', 'I bought these on sale for $190 but also bought the Sony XM4 to compare. Sound quality is way better on the Sony and much longer battery life. BUT… If your an iPhone user the automatic switching, spatial sound esp on movies and certain songs is so cool. It was hard to give it up and just to keep the Sony’s so I kept both.', \"I've tried all the rest but Apple continues to be the best.... the sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing.  I don't like to where them to work out for fear they might fall out so my wife bought me a cheap pair of knock offs and they just don't compare. The battery in the apple AirPods is also fantastic.  Apple products are getting better and better.\", \"I sent these bad bois for a ride in the laundry machine they still worked but with some crackly noises when using noise-canceling or transparency to be fair it was on heavy-duty so like 2.5x longer than a normal cycle, sustained quite the beating. I wouldn't recommend sending these through the laundry. all in all a solid device however I wish the bass was better.\", 'I needed these Apple AirPods Pro for work (we can listen to our music or podcasts) this is the first time I’ve used wireless and I love them!!  I love that I can program  the volume to where I can here if someone is talking to me while listening to my music. I’m also surprised how long the battery life is.', 'Bought the original AirPods and I was really disappointed in the sound quality, the way they fell out of my ears constantly, and the fact I could hardly hear anyone without getting them I. My ear just-right. With these I don’t have that problem at all. Great sound quality, decent bass, noise cancelling is awesome; especially when you are in a crowd!', 'I personally really like the AirPods Pro. I’ve had them now for about a 7 months and going from first generation AirPods to these is like a major major upgrade. Noise cancellation is great for when I go biking because I can still hear the things I need to hear but without the constant blow of the wind and loud car sounds. And also helps block out the people I don’t wanna hear. Plus it goes wonderfully with the iPhone and other apple products which it better for the price. I never liked most earbuds because it caused lots of ear infections but these are great Battery life is pretty fair. I had a hard choice of choosing some others that had longer battery life but I love the streamline of these so I choose them if you’re an avid apple user.', 'I own these and Pixel buds.  The airpods are more comfortable in long wear situations and noise cancelling comes in handy. Sound quality on the two is similar although Apple does a touch better with voices and Google does better with music.  Lack of volume control on the airpods is a major annoyance. The choice between the two depends on which ecosystem you live in.', \"best headphone I've ever bought. If you have more than one apple product like me you will definitely love this product. Especially after the last update, the connection speed has increased a lot and it became very easy. The battery life is very good, even if you have run out of battery, you can use it for a long time even if you plug it in for a short time.\", 'Long time Bose user. These sound 95% as good as my QC 35 ii. Noise cancelation is very good with music on, slightly less without music vs over the ears, but that is to be expected. Given AirPods convenience and size, I don’t expect to be using Bose much except for long flights. Five stars. Nice work Apple! Highly recommend.', \"I got those after returning my Echo Buds for various reasons. Number one being the fit closely followed by a buggy Software. Those are like an order of magnitude better. I did not know what I was missing before. They fit perfect, are very lightweight and are extreme easy to use. Yes, they are expensive and that is the reason why I did not get them right away, but they are worth every penny. My wife has the regular air pods and she loves them. Unfortunately the regular ones don't fit me so I had to go for the pro. Now with COVID-19 and me working from home which means 5+ hours of meetings every day they are a life saver.\", 'I did not but the original EarPods but wanted a wireless set so I purchased these. Unfortunately although they sound good and look good (with limited but acceptable functionality ) they do not stay in my ears. Constantly falling out, I have tried all three sizes for the ear plug but none keep them in my ears. This happens when walking and more often than not when moving my mouth - poorly designed and very costly considering you get no charger.', 'I absolutely love these because I developed a problem with hearing loud noises. These drown out outside sound completely when playing music, or muffle them enough so it is no longer a problem for me. It’s my first time trying noise canceling headphones and it actually works.', 'I was blown away with this product! I have owned cheap end wireless headphones and purchased these thinking they would be a step better. I was dead wrong. These headphones are incredible. They have incredible noise cancellation, they recognize when you have them in your ears and when you pull them out, they have multiple modes to utilize if you want a different sound experience, and they stay in your ears even while doing intense exercise! Absolutely phenomenal product.', 'I had been using wired Bose in-ear buds. Loved them, but wanted a lighter, wireless option. I did a back and forth sound check with the same music source and the same song. The Pod Pros were not as full sounding and I prepared to send them back. Then I turned off noise canceling and transparency. Presto, the sound seemed to expand and was competitive with my other ear buds.  I love the option of having noise canceling as an option for times when I am out and about and involved in other tasks, in other words when the music is not my main focus. I also like the fact that when I want to focus on the sound it is all right there. Great buy,', \"These are great, not as awesome as I'd hoped. Also, unless you have the perfect ears, I recommend getting a pair of ear hooks for them so they stay comfortably in your ear. These are also slippery little buggers so you have to be extra careful when you remove them as they can easily slip out of your fingers.\", 'These are a game changing piece of tech. Comfy and super high quality. Play with the fit and read all the Tech manuals. The noice canceling and transparent modes are needed to have if you fly or work in a loud environment. If you just want peace and quiet sometimes these are truly amazing.', 'The dang things fall out of ears, they don’t seal. You shouldn’t have to go buy 3rd party ear pieces to see if they will work foam or otherwise. I went and bought $50.00 worth of new ones only to find they didn’t change anything. For the price they charge you would think Apple would put a little effort into a design that works! All about the money not the customer.', 'Got these at the beginning of the lock down to allow for privacy in my meetings (I am a counselor so this is kind of a big deal). The battery life, sound quality, and most importantly the mic quality (how it sounds to others) is outstanding. If anything happened to them I would be ordering a new pair within the hour!', 'These are great and allow you hands free calls, text and replies. Call sound quality is excellent and music reproduction is good but not great. I took off one star because the new “spatial” feature is not compatible with I pad pro’s or at least the 10.5 version. That’s weird since it’s compatible with much cheaper but slightly newer iPads. Overall solid 4 star.', 'Los airpods llegaron dañados, en empaque que parecía nuevo, pero al usarlo el lado derecho tenía un ruido constante que nunca se quitó, es la primera vez que me sucede con un producto Apple, pareciera que no son nuevos sino arreglados de segunda mano y por eso el precio reducido vs la pagina oficial de Apple. Terrible, no lo recomiendo NUNCA, me toco devolverlo.', 'They did not work properly. THEY ARE SUPPER COMFORTABLE. I Don’t understand how some reviews said they are not comfortable. I have many earbuds and the AirPods Pro are the most comfortable! All the information and adjustments for the AirPods should be in ONE section of the phone/iPad etc. not in different sections!!!!! Quality wired headphones do sound better.', 'You can’t go wrong with these. I have Bose sound sport wireless earbuds too. Music wise the Bose sound better, more bass. Other than that you can’t compete with the AirPod pros. The way they integrate with your iPhone, ease of use, and functionality can’t be beat. The noise cancellation is great too. I like that there are two noise cancellation modes. Battery life is unbeatable. Would buy again.', 'My other regular Air Pods were not holding their charge and would die in under an hour. So due to the cost to replace the battery and time it would take to get back. I figured it was time to upgrade and I was not disappointed. These work great and look awesome. Price is great so take advantage. (there is a slight learning curve but anyone can pick them up quickly)', 'I have the generation 2 model of the original airpods and this pro is hands down much better all-around compared to the original. The ANC (Active Noise Cancelation) and the pass-through feature of the airpods pro is phenomenal. The airpods pro is definitely the choice to get over the original and worth the extra cost. No muffle for the in-ear piece is also nice feature.', 'I love these - they sound great and last for a long time.  One one problem is that they don’t fit as well as the old air pods.  I can’t use them while running because they fall out easily. Of course I’ve tried different sizes of rubber end pieces that come with them but that didn’t help', \"I've traded these out twice and the issue is that it doesn't stay connected to bluetooth. The original Airpods are MUCH better. The microphone cuts in and out (you think you might've hit the mute button) and the sound will drop and you'll have to disconnect and reconnect 2-3 times. Just go with the cheaper model. Apple mucked this one up pretty good.\", 'Battery life isn’t the greatest for the actual AirPods - but the case is so convenient and they charge so fast it isn’t an issue.  The best in ear noise cancellation I have found - sound it great but not amazing - they are not for die hard music addicts that want bass and loud music.  But the music sound is way better than most, the noise cancellation is adaptive and easy to switch off when needed.  Pairs amazing with all apple products and work great with 1 or both in ear for talking.  All in all- great. Amazon had a special price - less than anywhere for new (refurbished were 10 bucks less but -ewwww no thanks. I ordered yesterday and was advised delivery on Sunday - got to them today a day early on a Saturday ... great product, great service as always from amazon prime !', 'Amazing noise cancelling and sound quality is better than any ear bud I’ve used. I do have one complaint, I have found with noise canceling on, but between songs when it’s quiet I start to feel queasy / nauseas. Not enough to be sick or not wear them, but I find my self turning noise canceling off unless I’m in a noisy environment. I’ve recently worn these when mowing the grass and blowing leaves and wow I can hardly hear the loud equipment.', \"This was my first pair of wireless airpods from Apple. The whole process of setting up was quick and easy. The first moment I put them in my ears it felt being transported instantaneously to a different environment. The noise canceling feature is very good. The transparency mode is perfect as you wont have to take the buds off during quick face to face conversations. The sound is rich and full kinda reminiscent of the old Apple wired earbuds that had silicone ear tips. During workouts the earbuds stay comfortably within my small ears using the the medium sized tips The utopian experience was short lived tho. I had an issue of the sound crackling in my right ear bud. I tried everything like a factory reset and re-pairing the airpods to no avail. I think there might be a problem with the noise canceling feature. It's still under warranty so I'll call Apple for a replacement but ...I JUST GOT THIS!!!! I would cautiously recommend these earbuds...When it works\", 'These AirPods are really terrific. I don’t know how I did without them! These are much better than the less expensive ones. The extra price is worth every penny. I use them every day for talking on the phone with no hands and listening to audible books. So glad I got them! I highly recommend them!', \"I was initially very skeptical about getting Airpod Pros because they're pretty pricey. I didn't even get the previous model either due to the price. However, I finally just gave in and bought them and I don't regret my decision at all. I use them every day at work, home, and college. If you have an Amazon card I recommend doing the payment plan because it comes down to something like $40 a month, which is much more doable. Highly recommend for someone looking for professional sounding earbuds with great battery life.\", 'This product is amazing. The talk time is it about 3 1/2 to 4 hours and the noise cancellation feature works amazing. And the best part about it is when they die you pop them in the charger and they literally are good to go within 20 minutes. Buy them.', 'Incoming noise cancelllation is okay, though I need for speaker to repeat themselves if airplane overhead (not right overhead like in airport).  Outgoing noise cancellation is poor, other party hears the birds singing.  Battery life is okay, but not getting advertised length.  Connection to phone is not 100% seamless.  Good but was expecting better.', 'Apple made good this airpot pro. The music is plenty good from sound to bass. I own quite a few other wireless head phone and this one is holding good in my ear. UPDATE JUNE-2021: the right and left ear plug keep pop-out and worse one is battery ran out for more than 2 hours. ( I use roughly 4 time a week or less, since June-2021)', \"This is my second pair. I lost my first pair and bought a new pair right away. I bring them everywhere with me. They're great for any workout, plane ride, or anything else. Get a protective case for them. Unfortunately if you drop the case the air buds usually pop out and get on the floor which is gross, but they’re pretty tough because I’ve dropped mine many times\", 'Noise cancellation is excellent, as well as the sound clarity too.  Even older recordings that have not been remastered come through so well you can hear the bassist as well as the exactly what the rhythm guitarist is laying down. They fit well, where others have fallen out of my ears, these stay put. Battery life could be much better.', 'Don’t be surprised if the case feels flimsy, cheap, and the lid wobbles… I was definitely disappointed but that’s just a common quality control issue (get a case asap, the charging case scratches like crazy after two days of use). The sound Quality is great, if you have the original wired EarPods, just imagine that but with a good seal and a little more bass. One issue i did encounter is the right airpod wouldn’t work well with transparency mode with less than a month into use, if this happens just return them and get new ones instead of going through the hassle with apple like I did. Definitely recommend getting AppleCare+', 'Well I’ve had them in for an hr. I’m quite impressed. Didn’t expect the noise canceling to completely block all noise out. They do a good job though. They sound great. I have a $30 pair that sound pretty close. These are pricey but you can’t put a price on your hearing. These allow you to listen at a lower volume while doing noisy things. I think that’s good. Soooo if you need noise canceling , I think these are pretty good.', 'There is absolutely no point is trying to find similar quality at a lower cost it doesn’t exist. Whatever apple did to create these is amazing. Sound quality in gym is ridiculous, they do not fall out ever. No during cardio not while lifting not ever. I go week or two  with out charging the case and use these every day for at least an hour or two.', \"Bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them.  These have the option to turn the noise cancelling on or off so if you need to listen for something, while listening to music or a podcast, you can turn the noise cancelling off and hear other things outside of the sound coming through the buds.  On the other hand if you turn the noise cancelling on, you can't hear anything else outside of the sound coming through.  The charging cord is different.  Both ends are the same which means you plug one end into the buds and the other end into an Apple computer or Apple charge product.  If you don't have other Apple products, you may want to purchase or have the typical Apple charge cord for these.\", 'I’m pleasantly surprised at the superb quality of the sound!  The biggest issue with audio equipment is that you need higher volume to hear a more complete and full sound.  I’ve finally found something small and portable and practical to satisfy my exacting taste!  Worth every penny!', \"I love Apple products but these Airpods are far from Pro. Sound is good but not great and delfinitely not worth the asking  price. If you throw on a set of silicone noise reduction earbud tips on Airpods Gen 1 or 2 they will sound like the Pros. The worst part of the Airpod Pros is the battery life. Don't believe the hype!\", 'My son purchased these AirPods after saving up for some time. He was really excited to test them out and has not taken them out since receiving them! That says a lot.... The sound quality is awesome! So awesome, he felt it necessary for me to try them so that I could hear the sound quality for myself!  Although Apple products are expensive, the quality is superb! Now if we could only get Apple to stop forcing us to upgrade phone-wise would they be the greatest!😉', 'I looked at many many many wireless buds for about a year and ended up getting some raycons and was initially very pleased. A couple months later I was having issues with the buds stayed synced and even more problems trying to get them synced back together. I decided to bite the bullet and get the AirPods Pro and should have done so as soon as they came out. Immediately the noise canceling was noticeable great for use in a busy office and the transparency feature works well for when you need to notice someone that walks into your office. The additional tips are great for figuring out which fits best for you. I swap between my iPhone and PC several times a day and there is rarely ever a sync issue. If there is a problem, you just put them right back in the charging case for a second, pull them back out and boom back to perfect sync. They also work great for just having a bud in one ear at a time.', 'Regarding noise cancellation they are up to par with my Bose. Sound quality isn’t discernibly different from AirPods 2. Have not tested them in a sweaty environment yet. Fit well without any discomfort even after a few hours. Absolutely worth every penny only because of they noise cancellation feature— I don’t hear The loud, heavy traffic from the sidewalk with this feature- like night and day. Totally recommend.', 'Great quality, groundbreaking noise cancellation, transparency is amazing, really nothing bad to say about these guys, especially coming from the old gen AirPods, these are a major stepup! My only issue was that sometime they struggle to fit in your ear, no major issue with that, as you just reassure that they are firmly in place. Battery life is great as well. I work a lot and I try to take every chance I get to use these bad boys, imagine a studio set of headphone built into an earbud design. Nothing but positivity from these, well worth the money in my opinion.', 'After about a month of usage, the two would not work together. All sorts of troubleshooting was done to resolve the issue, but still could only use one AirPod at a time. Returned for return.', \"Glad to get these when they were on sale. I like everything about them, except the battery life.  I listen to podcasts all day at work and the four hours is just not enough.  I know it's all about the size of the battery and that's limited by the size of the earbuds, but it's still annoying.  Otherwise, very satisfied.\", \"The noise cancellation on this little guy is a game changer. Also the fit is far superior than the previous generations. It fits snug and doesn't feel like its going to fall out when you're working out. This comes with 3 different size ear inserts, for best results do the sound test on your phone. I have Beats and this is far better in sound/bass quality.\", 'Had the first gen air buds, which did not fit my ears well. Had to hold them in place to hear bass.  Thought this latest generation with different size ear plugs would be better.  They are, but not by much. Have to constantly adjust them to get a seal for noise cancellation and to hear bass.', 'I was wondering why one of the ear pieces was not working AT ALL. It felt lighter so I actually measured it and it WAS! (see pics). I also noticed the left side did not \"snap\" into the case like the right ear piece... it also did not charge. The color of the left ear piece was also slightly off. I then realized that it\\'d been duped! It was fake.... Not sure who is doing the QA here on these devices but I had a terrible experience. The seller here should be reprimanded for trying to pawn off a fake device!!!', \"They are overall great when in ideal conditions, but... When I run, they move around and noise cancellation stops working because they are no longer completely sealed. Additionally, they very regularly fall out of my ear, sometimes without warning. I am returning because I've only had them for a month and they've easily fallen out of my ear over 10 times while outside. If I have them for a year, there is a great chance they will fall out of my ear into a drain and never be recovered. The case is making a creaking noise when opening as well, which is unacceptable for a 1 month old APPLE product that costs $250. Overall, enjoyable at times but poor quality for long-term.\", 'Was lucky to pick these up when they were lowest price I had seen. Was initially worried if the Pros where worth it over the regular air pods. I can’t say I can compare but I am not disappointed with these. The clarity is amazing. I’m hearing subtle things in songs I’ve never noticed before.', 'Sound is really good, but not like over the ear headphones. Never any trouble connecting to my iPhone or Windows laptop. Battery life is several hours, with multiple charges from the case. Comes with sm/med/lrg earbud pads.', 'The sound quality is great I love how I can absolutely hear nothing when I the noise canceling on and how I can hear everything when I have the transparency mode on. I heard that you can even drive with these on but I’m not going to risk that. I do find them a bit annoying though because they do fall out of my ears a bit and I have to often exchange between the little ears cuff sizes. But other than that they’re great. The battery last a long time too.', 'This is one of the best earbuds and I would highly recommend buying these. The noise canceling is the best part of it, the noise cancellation works as good as a expensive Bose headphone which are twice the price. The AirPods Pro have a little  better noise quality then the last gen, but with noise canceling it feels the like the audio quality has more bass.', 'Upgraded from Gen 1 AirPods and were absolutely worth it. The noise canceling and transparency modes are really something you have to experience  and work very well. I only neglect one star because the hinge on the case is a cheaper material than in my old AirPods, therefor I can tell it isn’t as solid of a build quality. Would recommend.', \"Just got these and I have to say they are wonderful.  I didn't think I would ever like Air Pods but that was before Air Pods Pro.  These things seem pretty amazing.  I hated to spend the money but just like other Apple products I've purchased I am not disappointed.  I would highly recommend these to everyone that has an iPhone. The seller got them here when promised.  Thanks for the great service.\", 'The noise cancellation is ok but not worth the extra money.  Bose ear buds are much better and fit smaller ears. I’m going back to Bose.  I expected better battery life from ear buds and charging case, especially for the price point.  Just not worth the hype.  The only cool yet somewhat annoying aspect was I could hear what I had playing on my phone while taking on the phone.  The other person on the other end was unable to hear what I was listening too, but I could hear both at the same time.  Kind of freaky and strangely cool at the same time.  Since I don’t have any desire to repeat that experience I will be returning this product.', 'As soon as they were up and working it’s cutting in and out of connection. Static all the time, plus you can still hear things in the background with noise cancelation. Can still have a whole conversation with someone in noise cancelation while something is playing. I’ve used others before, who got them from apple, and they worked much better than this. Very dissatisfied with the quality. Apple has had issues with models made before October 2020, so these must be an older version that apple has “recalled” for free servicing.', 'The best headphones so far . The noice cancellation is exceptional . Super comfy and fits the ears snug ! Even during light workouts . The case charges super quick in less than 30 min . The headphones have super fast charge less than 10 min will do 40-50% . Over all it’s on the top of my list . Tried at least 10 other brands prior and nothing comes close .', 'Lasted two weeks!!!! Sound is pretty cool, I wanted this pods for a while now. Arrived quickly, the day after I purchased to be exact. For me they feel comfortable in the ear better than the regular none wireless earphones from apple or the classic AirPods. The sound cancelation and transparency works good! SADLY the pods I received where damaged/defected after two weeks of not much of used really, the left AirPod stop charging(I would always use both at the same time) I will place BOTH in the case and it would be a green light instead of red one. If I press hard down the left one it would change the color to RED!! Once I stop pressing it would get back on green, look at the pictures. I don’t know if we are reviving used or wrong manufacture items in amazon. Don’t take your chances just get them in Apple. Oh yeah I’m returning them for FREE. Hope you don’t get a bad experience!', 'I love the sound quality! My only complaint is I have very small ear canals and even the smallest buds are still big! I keep my hair pulled over my ears in order to keep them in place! A headband works too , however I wish they provided smaller earbuds! I’m an older adult and know that I’m not alone with this problem!', \"Never had a problem ordering from Amazon like this. Received disgusting, used airpods pro. Still had earwax on them from the last person. What is going on. Serial number on charging case doesn't match the number on the box either.\", 'Not gonna lie, these headphones have amazing sound quality for what they are with the noise cancellation and the Transparency mode especially being extremely useful features for working out Or trying to listen to music while conversing with someone else. That being said, they could not stay in my ears for more than 10-15 minutes without sliding out. I tried all three tips and positioned the airpods differently but unfortunately to no avail. Be mindful that they are not meant for everyone’s ears and apparently I’m not the only one with this issue. It would be better if Apple came out with memory foam tips for them. Make sure to try these AirPod pros out first to see they don’t slide out of your ears', 'The Apple Air Pod Pro ear piece is even larger than the original Air Pods and hurt my ears after 15 minutes. See photo. The Pro’s are on the top, original buds are on bottom in photo.  Why can’t Apple make smaller buds for kids and people like me with small ears?', \"Apple may have added a soft rubber bud feature to these but they still haven't fixed the issue of the body of the airpod putting pressure on the surround part of your ear.  Wear them for an hour and your ear and head will be hurting.  The pressure that these place on your tragus (google image search it but it is the little triangle part that comes off your face points toward the ear canal) will have you sending these back.  If you didn't wear the original apple ear buds because of ear pain stay away from these.\", \"I used to own the 1st generation of apple airpod. To be honest, i was not impressive. The connection was always problematic and very often, i had to manually connect. This latest version is much much better.  I have been using it for a few weeks and i have never had connections issues as far as i can remember. The voice was clear.  It's a bit expensive but i think it's worth it.\", 'This is my 2nd pair and you cannot ever go wrong with Apple products. They last forever and if you have issues within the first year the Apple store will replace them for free. Sound quality is great, noise cancellation is amazing and they also come with three different tips to fit different size ears.', \"I bought these 5 months ago and they worked great until I started hearing crackling when I spoke. I called Apple Support and they said it's a known issue and wanted to charge me $200 to replace both pieces with refurbished airpods. I can buy new ones for $230, so no thanks Apple Support! Amazon was useless because it's past the return period. It's clear that I received defective Airpods and neither Apple nor Amazon have the decency to honor the one-year warranty ***despite the fact that Apple Support admitted this is a known issue*** Very disappointed with Apple and Amazon considering how expensive the Airpod Pros are.\", 'They’re small - They fit well-the noise cancellation is OK-they’re exactly what they were meant to do. The sound quality is pretty good - the end result is that they are convenient – they work well and I like them I only wish they Manufactured them in black and space gray. Hopefully in the next few years it will be possible to put batteries in products this  small that last for 30 hours. That would be awesome', 'I’m extremely disappointed in this purchase. While I think the sound quality is very good, they refused to stay in my ears. I’ve tried each of the supplied silicone tips, but they all fall out unexpectedly. I’m certain they will either be lost, or damaged when they hit the floor. I don’t see how anyone could use then while doing any activity other than sitting quietly.  Don’t even consider trying to use them at the gym, etc.', 'These keep falling out of my ears when I look down or chew food.  Good thing they haven’t cracked on the ground yet. I’m afraid to use them on my bike rides because I might loose them.  I’ve tried all three sizes of ear inserts with no luck. I only keep using them because I paid so much for them and want to get my money’s worth. The sound quality and noise canceling are good.', \"Took the plunge and glad I did. I don't have to hear the awful music the gym has to offer anymore. And all the grunters, screamers and swole Alpha hopefuls are whisked away in silence. All I can hear is the occasional iron in the background clink. Thanks Apple for saving my sanity from the  nonsensical conversation I was subjected to. And Amazon for making the price affordable. If you want to drown out the outside sounds and relish your own music and not the guy next to you who is blaring Creed over his phone speakers. DO IT!!!!!\", 'If you have small or sensitive ears, buy these. I had regular AirPods which killed my ears after 15 minutes of use. These also have superior sound quality and noise canceling which really works. Worth the extra $$. Only downside is battery charge doesn’t seem to last super long.', \"I got this during a blackfriday sale for $169. These headphones are amazing and great sound quality. The person I gifted them too loves them. The comfort is unmatched compared to other in-ear headphone and the noise cancellation is nice. Battery life isn't great, but the little charging case helps with that. They are sturdy as well. Even after multiple drops from 3ft, they continue to work without any issues or visible damage.\", 'Everything about these is awesome except one thing... will not stay in ears for any usable amount of time no matter what eartips you use. Not even the Comply foam eartips. Almost unusable. Definitely do not use during a workout or any activity involving movement. Other than that they sound and function amazingly.', 'I absolutely LOVE these headphones! Well worth the money. They fit perfectly in your ear and don’t easily fall out. The sound quality is excellent. You can actually hear the bass unlike the original AirPods. Noise cancellation is better than I thought it would be! Very sleek design that is practical. Overall great product.', 'I used the AirPods for 2 years before finally deciding to upgrade and it was well worth it. The AirPods worked great but a lot of environmental sound was still filtering into my ears, causing me to not hear what I’m listening to or turn up the volume to a point that was dangerous for my hearing. The noise cancellation of the AirPod Pros does a great job and the mechanics of the transition between noise cancellation and transparency modes are very simple and effective. They do not cancel out all loud sounds but as a safety hazard, you do not want noise cancellation to cancel absolutely every sound that exists. Would recommend to anyone who is looking to buy.', 'AirPod Pros are definitely nice, but $250.00 nice, I don’t think so. I gave them an honest 4 stars, but no more. I am already having issues with the ear tip test, but as far as the overall quality I would give it two thumbs up. The sound is good and sound cancellation is better. I like the AirPod Pros, but I don’t think I would purchase another pair after these see their day.', \"i have owned this for a bit over 2 months.  worked fine.  however today it suddenly stopped charging.  case reported 0% charge for a few moments then totally dead.  won't come up for pairing, lights will not come on on case.  called apple.  they said i must update the firmware on the case.  but of course that requires the case to have power.  it will not charge. their solution to this is that i must go to the apple store.  next appointment is over a week away.  it will require hours of my time to do this. this is clearly their problem.  it is barely out of the box.  totally unacceptable solution.  i could not be more unhappy.  for the value of my time, i might as well throw them in the trash.\", 'I have had the very first airpods it lasted 2 years of heavy use after 2 years the battery was just not lasting long and from the sweat the bottom part clogged with green residue and the mic had stopped working on the left piece. These were 2 years of heavy use. I just got these pros and so far so good battery lasts for a long time. Sound quality is decent not the best. It is so easy to use. So at this point quality vs easy to use. It was hurting my ear for little bit for a bout a week but then I got used to it.', 'Useless for calls as it picks up nearby noise and drives the other person mad, ridiculous that a billion dollar company does not have solution this problem. Battery time is good and music sound is pretty good. Expected to be able to ditch the Plantronics mic for calls for one-in-all unit but no dice.', 'These headphones are great. I had the original ones for a long time until my dog got a hold of one of them and chewed it. Instead of repurchasing the same ones, I opted to get the pro’s since I know they had more features like noise cancellation, transparency mode, and spatial audio(coming this year with the software update). Initially, I had some trouble fitting them in the ear but the extra size tips helped the headphones give a better fit to my small ears. They paired to my iPhone 11 Pro as soon as I opened the cases. Love that it integrates to my iPad and Mac air seamlessly. As someone that listens to music almost daily, I found myself listening to music at a lower level than I did with my original AirPods. Would highly recommend these.', 'I have been use it for over two weeks now. It does look pretty good and feels good on hands. For the sound quality Is pretty good when you use both ear butts . It’s pretty good for noise cancellation. Only thing I don’t like is when you wearing for few hours. Then my ear is hurting.', 'As always Apple does not disappoint. These are great. I was concerned about possibly losing one but the phone let’s you know when they are activated and when on falls out of you ear. Very comfortable and easy to use.  Bought a pair for my granddaughter.', \"I have connectivity issues and I'm having to reset the airpods because  orange light flashes every couple of weeks. The left airpod doesn't always work which is super annoying. I got them for $70 off the retail price maybe that's why I'm having issues.\", 'Great sound quality, noise cancellation and good battery life. Unfortunately product has a very bad fit regardless of the way you try to wear it. I even tried 2 different foam tips to improve fit but the AirPod kept falling out after a few minutes. When putting pressure to adjust it back to the ear, phone calls are accidentally hung out. Considering the very high price and the brand quality, this is totally unacceptable. The regular AirPods have a much better fit although far from being ideal.', 'I was skeptical to spend the money after I had wasted money on the other style of AirPods. Totally worth the money!!! They are comfortable AND stay in my ears. I used them while mowing the lawn and I couldn’t believe how much noise cancellation they provided. The previous style hurt my ears so bad and would constantly fall out because the earpiece was too big.', 'The AirPod Pros are actually pretty awesome. That’s why it’s so frustrating when the fail / break / or just don’t fit your ears. They worked great the first month I had them then the trouble started. The ear tip test started failing. First in one ear then the other. Apple replaced them for me (only through mail. Going to store was a waste of time), but again, they failed in almost the same way. This leads to weird pressure in your ears, simile to what it feels like being underwater. Sadly, I’ve given up on what could be an awesome product.', 'I love these. I wanted these to work with my ears so bad. They sound great, connect perfectly, and they are so convenient. But unfortunately I think my ears are too small or aren’t deep enough because they kept falling out. Changing the tips didn’t help; I also bought memory foam tips to see if it would help. I think it is because the big white piece connected to the tip is too big for my ear, so it always felt like it didn’t sit securely in my ear. I returned the item. Majorly bummed.', 'I have tried all the sizes, and these are just poorly designed.  They will not stay in my ears.  I have had echo buds, which stayed in great.  Very disappointed.', 'Great audio, great battery and super easy to use, but I have had them fall out multiple times while biking. I’ve tried each ear gasket/size thing and they all seem to come loose eventually. This isn’t excessive and I would still purchase them, but I can see more intense activity like jumping/running being an issue for them staying in.', 'It’s extremely comfortable, and it doesn’t hurt my ears which is really on the sensitive picky side. It’s not hard against the ears because of the rubbery part, and the noise cancellation is spectacular. Once you put it on, you’re in your own world :) sometimes my significant other needs to yell for me to hear lol sound quality is great, crisp and clear, and after one charge, I’ve used it for a long time but the battery is still very strong. I think it’s because the case holds a big charge to charge the airpods when you put it back in.', 'I was worried as to whether or not I would receive authentic Apple Airpod Pros. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and saw the typical Apple shrink wrap on the package. Needless to say these AirPod Pros are legit and work as expected. Definitely recommend Amazon and Apple as a team in regards to this purchase', 'Why buy: Status. Good compatibility with Apple products. Where to be careful: Fit. The world is littered with lost Apple AirPods. Get leases. Even if some of the status factor is diluted. Why not buy: SQ. If you’re listening to disk resident media at compression >128kbps, any decent wired buds at less than half the cost will crush the AirPods.', \"I love these headphones when I need to plug in and not be bothered at work. They fall out of your ears too easily is my only real complaint. I wouldn't feel amazing wearing these to work out at all. Also the battery life is about 4 hours, so I have to plug them in halfway through the day and recharge. However, they charge really fast so that's good.\", 'Don’t stay in your ears and Apple doesn’t back. Purchased a pair for my wife and one for me. My wife could not use they kept falling out of her ears. Even after going through the whole fitting the AirPods thing. She keeps hers on her night table. I told her I didn’t have that problem. Then one falls out my ear, gets crushed and the warranty doesn’t cover that. They want about $100 to replace the broken ear pod. Did not even get three months out of them. I thought better of Apple, but you live and learn. . Very disappointed', 'They charge $200 for their headphones but don’t even give you the charger you need to charge them. It probably costs them 5 cents for their piece of **** made in China charger, but they don’t include it and charge you an extra $20 to get one. I am returning them, you lost a sale because you are too cheap to include the needed charging plug.', 'Great sound quality. The ANC is amazing. Battery life is great. They charge quickly. I have given several pairs as gifts. The recipients are always thrilled. Made even better with the foam style tips that can be purchased separately.', \"The AirPods Pro has been a great investment. From the ANC features to the tight integration across the Apple ecosystem, this product is seamless to use, sounds great, and is just a pleasure to have around. Pairing takes less than 5 seconds, the eartips are swappable to make the fit as tight as possible, and its use cases are varied. I wear these all the time, sometimes with one airpod in my ear so I can balance listening to podcasts while doing activities. It also supports audio sharing natively which is a great feature to use with friends. On top of that, Apple is actively improving the AirPods via firmware upgrades with spatial audio coming as part of iOS 14. My only gripe is its shorter battery life compared to competitors like the Sony WF-1000XM3s or PowerBeats. However, the seamlessness and great ANC makes up for it very quickly. If you're on the fence - go get these.\", 'They connect so easily with iPhone but the sound quality is not what it should be for the price point, the bass is shallow, they sound tinny compared to headphones at half the price. Call quality is great and the noise cancellation is great. They are nice for everyday use but not good for audiophiles', 'The noise cancellation is amazing, and I wear them all the time. After a while they can make your ears sore. Mine are all the smallest ear plugs available and they are still just a little too big. I use them so much I have to charge them every few days but their battery life is relatively good', 'These iPods are remarkable, having to pay so much for them wasn’t so great. Shortly after receiving them I saw an infomercial for a similar ear-pod that was only $50.00...wish I’d purchased them first! I’m not knocking  ‘Apple’ products or quality, but, their prices are over the top!', 'Highly disappointed!! Left ear stopped working immediately after return window ended. Followed tech advice to disconnect AirPods and reconnect. I did so, and it worked!! However, next time I went to use the buds, left side doesn’t work. Have to disconnect EVERY time I use them and sometimes Bluetooth takes too long to find, I just give up and walk without the buds. $200 wasted!', 'Never have to take them out to hold conversations or be aware of your surroundings with the transparency mode. Stay in my ear comfortably and don’t fall out like the prior pods. I love them so much and my wife did as well after trying them, I had to get another pair. The battery life is as stated and the pods charge super quick in the case. I spend all day on the phone and usually only take them out during lunch or meetings and have never had them go dead. I strongly recommend these to anyone looking for a seriously true hands free experience.', \"This will be the worst product by Apple. I own many apple devices but this is the lowest in terms of satisfaction. Ear plug does not stay on. They keep comes off in every 5 mins. I tried all inserts came with the product but they can not keep it to my ear. I tried them on my wife's ear but same problem. Do not waste your money on them.\", \"My AirPods stopped pairing after just 4 months of use...I have had AirPods in the past that lasted for years, think this were defective... Lost the return ''window'' will have to see with Apple to get them replaced.\", 'Here comes the AirPods Pro, all nice and sealed. Brand new right? Ha, I wish. I open up the charging case and the AirPods are covered in debris and short hair. Everything in the packaging reeks of chemicals, and I\\'m not talking about the new \"Apple\" smell. I\\'m talking about the one that might have just killed half of my brain cells upon inhaling. I lost the other half of my brain cells when I realized that I expected anything different from amazon. Just spend the extra $50 in the Apple store if you want to get an actual new pair, not some pair that\\'s been stuck up someone\\'s arse. And yep, I\\'m still sneezing.', 'I absolutely love my AirPods! I cannot say enough good things about them. I am constantly bragging to my husband about new features I have discovered or how well they work. I love that they work in one ear or both and when i remove one, it pauses the music! Transparency mode is GREAT because I have 3 small children so I am always able to hear them while using the headphones (I only use one while they are up so calm down). They are sweat proof so I work out with them on. They are also water proof but I am too chicken to test it! Lol. I hardly ever have to charge them and each AirPod has its own battery! As well as the case. Overall, just a great buy and definitely worth the price!', 'These things my husband bought me for our Anniversary present and let me say...worth EVERY dollar!!! I use them everyday and if you go somewhere where you don’t want to hear others talk...these are awesome!!! They really outdid themselves when they came up with these air buds!! Absolutely the best!!! Love, Love!!!!', 'It is a good noise canceling earphones. I think they are really expensive and have cheaper options out there with similar output. It also sometimes comes out of my ear. I like the transparency mode which makes lets you keep an ear out to the outside. I wanted this for airplane travel but over ear headphones do a much better job with the jet noise cancellation.', 'todo llegó bien. Me encantó.. compré el \"Apple 20W USB-C adaptador de corriente\" aparte ya que sólo trae el cable cargador.', 'Sooo worth it! I have used noise cancelling headphones in the past like the Bose QuietComfort, and sure go for that if you want a TOTAL noise blackout since this airpods will not really block out your noise surrounding (just the vibration from my observation). When I’m in the car, I don’t hear the engine but i can hear some people’s murmur and the radio, depends on the type of music i listen to and how loud the radio is. Although from my observation, when the car takes on speed bumps, i do notice the sound to get a little off. I don’t know how to explain it very well but it’s like listening to a radio that’s losing its signal. Something like that. I’ve yet to try this on a plane when the pandemic is over. Hopefully this will be very helpful!', 'These do not stay in my ears. My regular AirPods stayed in fine at the gym or jogging with little to no adjustment. But just google it for yourself before you buy- so many hacks and videos and replacements from third party manufacturers because they slip out or feel like they are slipping out even when I’m lying in bed or sitting at my desk. I really should have just waited for something else to come out.', 'I’m an Apple junkie and have looked forward the Pro headphones. For in-ear headphones, the noise cancellation works well. It’s actually remarkable given how small the headphones are. They also stay in my ear well while working out. This wasn’t true with the older AirPods. The only slightly disappointing thing about the headphones is the sound quality. It’s very good, but not as good as the previous AirPods. Not a huge deal as the sound is still amazing, just slightly disappointed. Overall, a great product.', 'The headphones fit snugly in my ears and do not come out when I shake my head violently. However after 5-10 minutes the earbuds slide out of my ears very slowly and eventually fully fall out. The sound quality is great, however the MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE EARBUDS, WHICH IS TO STAY IN YOUR EARS, DOES NOT WORK. Very annoying. Do not buy. I regret it very much.', 'The noise cancellation on these is absolutely incredible, and the transparency mode is really nice as well to be able to listen to music and still have a conversation or hear people around you when you need to. Overall sound quality is very good as well, though I’m not an audiophile. Sounds great to me though. Battery life is good as well, and if the ear buds die you can get an hour more of time off a quick charge in the case for ten minutes or so. 9/10 highly recommend.', 'Quality is still there.... noise cancellation is superb!  however, price increase is not justified knowing that Apple hasn’t spent needed time making sure these pricey pair won’t fall off your ears. Shame on Apple R&D to rush them to market.  Apple has to launch products only after discussing what S. jobs would have thought of any of their products before launch to mkt.', 'I didn’t think it was possible but the original airpods are much more comfortable. This has a very strong suction feel and would feel too much for my ear after a while. The original airpods would comfortably sit in your ear and you wouldn’t even notice it’s inside your ear.', \"The product was awesome and I loved them. Then after having them for a little less then a month a heard rattling inside my right earbud. I thought it was very annoying when my music stopped and I have noise cancelation on. So the next day the earbud crapped out and wouldn't sync with other earbud. If I sync it by itself it just static. So basically a had it for one month and the right earbud broke from internal reasons.\", \"I've had these for a few months and randomly they will produce no sound. When this happens I usually pause, take them out of my ears, put them back in and then play. Usualy this allows them to reset but this shouldnt happen In addition  sometimes the volume is not on earpod volume. it's very low and I have to make the volume a high number just to hear regular sound I handel them delecately and i should not be having these issues I do love the noise cancelation and the ability to use one earpod easily at a time. I also love that they come with 3 sized ear squishy thingies and the shape really fits in my small ear\", 'It was a decent product -- great noise cancellation and okay sound quality, until the left pod stopped working completely after I used for two days. I am extremely disappointed and looked up online and found this is a common issue.  I tried to reset it hundred times,  but to no avail. The left pod cannot be connected or charged. I am guessing there was some connection issue between it and the case, such that the case cannot detect the pod. I could have returned it and ask for a new item, but I fear that I will get another defective set and waste even more time. So I will most likely return this for a refund and refrain from this product until it becomes more mature. I do hope that Apple can exercise some quality control on such an expensive gadget.', 'I was hesitant to spend so much money on something like this. They were a gift for my husband. He LOVES them! He uses them while cutting the grass, and he was skeptical on if it would really cancel out noise. They do, beautifully!  We both wish the smallest ear bud size would be even smaller, but other than that, we love them!', 'I am an Apple guy through and through but I am totally disappointed in the new Airpods Pro. First, taking them out and putting them back in is twice as cumbersome as the first generation. The sound quality is nowhere near its predecessor. While not expecting anywhere near the noise cancellation quality of over the ear sets, the difference in \"transparent mode\" and noise cancellation is virtually non-existent. Finally, fit...I tried all three different earpieces and never felt comfortable with any of them. Sending them back for a refund...', \"These earbuds don't stick in my ears. So why do I need all these cool features like noise cancellation and other unimportant things if these headphones are constantly trying to fall out of my ears? I put them back all the time, every 5 minutes.  Do I have unusual ears? I do not think so. The other earbuds held up much better. And I don't understand why other people rate these headphones so highly. I have a feeling that this high scores are just a hoax. They are so expensive and cool and popular. But why all this is necessary if they do not sit in their ear and all the time do not try to escape?  This is ridiculous.\", 'Amazing and convenient. Taking me a while to get used to the noise cancellation part of it. The only negative thing is the tiny print that comes on what I think might be instructions was not readable. So I had to search online to figure out how to use them and charge them etc.', \"This is the first Apple product I have ever owned that I have had such trouble with. One ear bud or the other won't work sometimes, phone callers can't hear me and I can't hear them once I answer and now, they will no longer connect to my phone. I have a sneaking suspicion that these are knock-offs. DO NOT WASTE $200+ ON THESE. BUY THEM DIRECTLY FROM APPLE!!\", \"While the sound quality is good and the noise cancellation is excellent - I however really regret buying them and should have stuck to the cheaper normal airpods. Firstly they don't stay in you ear and are constantly falling out - a problem that I never have with my old originals airpods. The other pain in the backside, its getting them out of the case and putting them in the case - again fiddly and not as well laid out as the original case. Do yourself a favor  buy just  the Airpods and not the Airpods Pro - Save money and get a better more usable set.\", 'So far the AirPods work , but they were previous owned . Not new ! Bought different case cover  , they all fall off it . Makes me think it’s fake . Never happened to my other AirPods I bought from Best Buy . Even used the same cover. Pretty sure they’re fake', 'I wanted to resist the hype on these things- but I was wrong to do that- lol These are crazy cool and surpassed all I expected, this is some Alien Technology or something because I cannot imagine how they block out so much sound; like an on/off switch! A bit pricey (for now), but glad I splurged on myself- very impressive product and I really use them more than I thought I would. Highly recommend 👍🏼', 'So I ordered a pair on Black Friday in Like New condition from Amazon Warehouse. Cool. I’ve ordered other high dollar items from them and I have had great experiences. I don’t mind an open package for a slight discount. WELL, ordering these was a MISTAKE. The first set I ordered was a Pro box with the standard AirPods inside?! I mean, where was the QC on that? So I gave it another shot, I ordered a replacement pair- which were the correct set but only had one working pod. Just why?? They were a Christmas gift (to myself) so at this point I couldn’t even order again and receive in time to put under the tree and surprise myself. I returned both and ordered new from the bullseye.  Shoulda done that from the start.  Don’t be tempted by Warehouse deals!!', 'Bought a pair of these for my son and husband so I finally decided to get myself a pair. Excellent product and nothing else compares. Sound quality is incredible. Worth every penny, I promise. Very light use and battery lasts a long time.  I got them over a month ago and I haven’t needed to recharge them yet.', 'this is my second pair of AirPods.  the Pro is much better than the second generation.  sounds is very good considering the small and compact size.  easy to connect and switch with my Apple devices.  The noise canceling feature is really fantastic.  Talking feature is also very useful, which you can keep the earbuds in your ear and talk with others smoothly.', 'Excelente lo recomiendo al 100%  × 100% perfect todo original de la tienda Apple buen envoltura todo bien empaquetado todo legal todo original de verdad que estoy sorprendida como me encanta la inversión que hice en este AirPods estuve revisando viodes  y comparando los originales con la marca china y de verdad que este original de la tienda Apple es malo recomendé a una amiga a una vecina a mi esposo y a mi hijo y lo compraron con el mismo vendedor', 'AirPod Pros almost always get 5 star ratings.  For the price difference between AirPod generation 2, which I owned, and these, I expected a bigger difference in sound quality.  Further, Apple changed the firmware after I bought them and the noise cancelation got worse.  Perhaps they will fix that. I have wired Bose noise canceling ear bugs.  They are better than the AirPod Pros on an airplane.', 'Great ear phones but just short of perfection. They have such good seal and noise cancelling that when you run, you can feel the air pressure or impulses of your feet hitting the ground through your ears. They also some times lose blue tooth connection randomly and sometimes I have to put them back in the case and pull them out again to get them to reset. Other than that, these are amazing. I wish they came with bigger tips as well but I have large ears I guess!', \"Amazon is great in terms of shipping product in time, mine arrived 7 days after placing the order. My friend bought it at the same time at Apple.com but waited more than a month for it. Despite the great features, the AirPods pro I got has some connection issues with the left unit. 50% of the time, the left unit won't connect at all so I have to re-pair it with my phone. And also, sometimes the left unit won't charge while it's in the case. I saw 10% charged on the left and 80% on the right a couple of times a week. Ordered a replacement and it's been working perfectly so far. Will update if anything happens in the future.\", 'I have always hated apple earphones because they hurt my small ears, even the original AirPods hurt my ears and would always fall out. I decided to buy these just to try them ( I expected to return them because I thought would hurt my ears) I used them for about a day and I absolutely loved them! They fit in my small ears perfectly even with the medium tips. The noise cancellation and transparency  is amazing. They can be in my ears for hours and I don’t even notice them, and they don’t fall out. I love these and I would highly consider buying these if you need new earphones.', 'Very nice little headphone with a wide variety of features and excellent sound. The price reduction, $179 from $249, makes it a little more affordable. Highly recommend👍 Cons: do not provide a charging block (only a charging cable)', 'These are replacements and work great. The sound is clear and battery lasts all day or at least 5 hours, I only use one at a time so I have the other one charging.', \"These are the best headphones I have ever used. The sound is beautiful, the fit is perfect. I literally just got these out the box and I fell in love! These headphones are suitable for sports enthusiasts. Airpods Pro has a new anti-sweat function, so you don't have to worry about sweat damaging the headphones during exercise. For noise cancellation, they are surprisingly very effective. More effective than I thought they would be. The battery is very impressive, but the noise reduction function may consume more power.\", 'They are overpriced, sound isolation is not great, but that can be a good thing depending on your use case.  Active noise cancelation does not compensate.  They sound decent, hearthrough mode works great, and they are very good for making calls', \"I really enjoy these earbuds. They aren't perfect as many fans of Apple would lead you to believe. I find it them to fit uncomfortably. the main part of the AirPods themselves are a lot bigger and bulkier.  (To understand better see photos.) The original AirPods of fit perfectly for me. So i had believed that these would be similar. I assure you they are not. Looking past that, the sound quality is very very good. Similar to the original AirPods they have more punch and ‘bass boost’ sound. The noise cancellation isn’t perfect but it truly gets the job done. Transparency mode is quite helpful. I have trouble hearing conversations and voices but transparency mode give a slight amplification to outside sound. The battery life is shorter than the 1st generation AirPods, but given the new modes it’s understood why it will have a shorter battery life. Overall, its a great upgrade in the right direction, but has some flaws to polish out for a new design.\", 'They work amazing and the ear buds fits perfect! And the sound quality is amazing!! Also the noise cancellation works wonders 🙌🏼 But also be careful when you have the noise cancellation on because trust me you can’t hear anything around you 😅 And The packaging was good and nothing came in damaged.', 'I have the AirPods 2 and was excited to upgrade to the pros because of the features, even though my 2s are perfectly fine. But after trying them with every size of ear tip multiple times I can safely say that these hurt my ear cartilage/bones after 10 minutes of use, compared to hours on the 2s. I really wish apple thought more about ear shape when designing these. Will be returning.', 'my first impressions I close my eyes and I turned off my brain, it was  like I was floating in space. I recently started using this for meditation to block out all the noise, the noise cancellation it\\'s on some next level stuff.  the \"hey Siri\" feature works. also it\\'s kind of weird it is like talking to a robot, that does things for you overall this is magic', 'I was skeptical.  I have another set of air pods, but not pro.  I wasn’t a fan of them.  Kept falling out of my ears and just didn’t lock in the sound like I was looking for.  I was looking at BOSE and a few other top of the line noise canceling ear buds but decided to go with these. NO DISAPPOINTMENT at all!!!!!  Glad I went with the air pods pro.  Very impressed!!!  I’f your an apple user go with these.  I think you’ll love them too!', 'I purchased these after my Bose headphones died after years.  The noise-canceling works better than the Bose ever did.  The Airpods are comfortable and very easy to use.  I was concerned after reading another review about the strength of the Bluetooth but had no problem going from upstairs to down without my iPhone in my pocket.  The quality of playback in My Music is great.  So happy with this purchase.', \"After a month of having them and it was past the return date they don't hold a charge. The left one doesn't charge at all and the right only a little while before dead. These were listed as new, but believe they were refurbished or something!! Very disappointing to spend so much money for them to not work after a month!!\", 'It’s been two weeks , sound is crisp I can hear the beats clearly , bass is pretty good but I believe Sony headphones have more bass then these , noise cancellation works good. Battery life gives 5 hrs with calls and if you charge in case then it last you nearly 2 days. Cons: -Charge case can get scratches if you have keys in your pocket with it. -It would be better with more battery life. -Functionality to increase or decrease volume by gestures or button which is pretty hard to press. Over all pretty good purchase $169+tax', \"Works great, sound is not the best for the cost, would like a little more bass. Does fall out of my ears on occasion so if wearing it for any activity I recommend using something wrapped around your neck and attached to the buds just in case it falls out. I like that it is on as soon as you put one bud in your ear and the sound blocking is ok but does not block out completely. Haven't tried it with anything loud yet.\", 'So much better than previous air pods. Noise cancelling makes a huge difference. Also can charge with ear tips on now.

When I received them, the light on the case did not light up green and I had a hard time pairing with my phone. Despite charging the case and airpods to 100%, something was still messed up. I reached out to Amazon (who has great customer service btw) and they sent a new pair within a couple of days. I LOVE my new ones that actually work and I definitely think they are worth the splurge. The noise cancellation is insane and I love the discreet button feature.', 'I loved every about my AirPod Pros except the way they fit in my ear! My ears were in pain since  the first day I started using them. It felt like they were  cut into part of my ear. I had swelling, red marks, and bleeding. I didn’t wear them all the time and I only wore one at a time as well to see if that would help. I tried changing out the ear tips but nothing made them more comfortable. I contacted Apple and they suggested I return them and try one of their other products.', 'I love my Airpod Pros, these are probably one of the best products Apple has ever made!

They fit good and there are no issues with them staying in my ears! Battery life seems to be pretty good also', 'These are not that comfy. Disclosure - I have tragus piercings but I never had an issue with the wired in ears. WFH, I have to make sure to take breaks using these or my ear will get really sore. Wish these had volume control but my apple watch works well for that. Would still buy again. I will never go back to wired in ears.', 'I love the simplicity of using my Apple products together.

Unfortunately I have some difficulties with the left one staying in my ear.', 'I absolutely love these!! I have small ears so I’ve always struggled with finding comfortable headphones/earphones that will not bother my ears. Making them hurt or fall out. These are perfect because I can select from the 3 options of earbuds. I definitely recommend!!!! The audio and noise cancellation is amazing!!', 'The good:  very comfortable, compact, great looking, sturdy build. The disappointment: The overall sound is alright.  It has deep bass but too light.  The bass on this pair is exceptionally light in my opinion.  Maybe others like it but It’s too flat thus it’s not exciting.  Now I have Bose quiet comfort earbuds.  Both have kinda similar sound profile but Bose has a little more sub-bass.', 'They sound amazing and have the best noise canceling I have ever heard! They don’t work well with Androids. Update I dropped the right one in the cat water dish because I’m clumsy and it still works fine! Battery is amazing!', 'I was very happy with my purchase. The seller shipped fast and I got what I paid for. I have tried several true wireless headphones and none have been nearly as good as the AirPod Pros. I wasn’t a fan or how the traditional AirPods fit in the ear so I was sold when they updated the fit. They do still hurt my ears when they are in too long but that’s the only downfall. I love the noise cancelling feature and everyone can hear me very well on calls which was a big plus for me. It took me awhile to decide to spend the money on them, but I’m happy I did.', 'Sound great, noise canceling is great! A little uncomfortable in the ears at first but quickly got used to them. I prefer these over my Beats Studios for short periods as the battery life isn’t the greatest when noise canceling is on.', 'Bought my Apple AirPod Pros on sale and so glad I did! The sound quality is excellent, the operation simple and elegant. I have Bose Quiet Comfort ANC headphones, Aftershokz, and other brands, and these AirPod Pros are my new favorite. I highly recommend them!!', \"Won't regret, amazing purchase specially if you get them on discount here. If you own multiple Apple devices these buddies are AMAZING, the spatial audio feature with the new iPad Air makes it a cinema-like experience, the noise-cancelling feature works perfectly. Battery life is...meh, but with the charger u get through the days if you don't use them for extremely long periods, about 4.5 hours as advertised lol. Overall, great product, a masterpiece.\", 'I love the noise canceling and transparency modes. I’m still getting used to the in ear feeling. That has been odd. But transparency mode is amazing for walking and being able to hear the outside world. When I’m inside the noise canceling is as good as my old over the ear headphones. Good job Apple!', 'Love these! I bought a pair of Skullcandy Indy’s on Black Friday and have been struggling with them. They are truly awful. AirPods Pro are amazing. They fit and sound great. Did I mention that I love them? The noise canceling and transparency modes work great too. Nice feature.', 'I had the original AirPods for three years without issue, never lost them, never had any sort of problem with them. In less than 2 months I’ve had complete breakdowns three times over losing BOTH earpieces. Why? If the case falls, while falling, it opens and the earpieces fly. And when it hits the floor it closes again. So I’ve picked it up only to realize the pieces are missing hours later. This is terrible design flaw. Last time they fell getting out of my car and didn’t realize. One is completely shattered and it’s $80 to replace an earpiece.', 'The AirPods is not working. I already tried everything and doesn’t work, when it work the audio start to be bad and lagging. want to return it, but looks like i can’t even. Can someone please enter in contact with me for I solve this problem. I already talked with the customer service but the didn’t help. I want to return and I want my money back, I didn’t pay that much for something that doesn’t work', \"This apple airpods are the best! I love my airpods, the noise cancellation is awesome you can't hear nothing from outside which makes it better to hear music loud and clear. The quality is amazing. And I have to be honest I've started using my airpods to cancel out the noise that my boyfriend makes at night when he snores and sometimes he won't let me sleep so I started using my airpods without the music just to use it as earplugs and let me tell you even without the music this airpods work to cancel out any noise and I sleep like a baby.\", \"I was reluctant to purchase these due to the price but I purchased them when they were on sale and I had a gift card so the purchase didn't sting as much. They're worth the money because of the active noise cancellation. They also help me having to not take my iPhone or if my pocket while running due to the Siri integration.\", 'I first tried normal airpods. They are very comfortable, but would continually fall out of my right ear.  I tried the Powerbeats Pro- they are much larger and a reliability nightmare. I was going to give up on Apple wireless earbuds, but decided to give them one more chance. I’m glad I did. The Airpods Pro are excellent, both in fit and sound quality.', 'Color me skeptical for these ear buds. Have a wireless set with cords that kept getting in my way. Wanted something more compact for workouts. Long battery life. Unparalleled sound. Can’t hear anything but my music in the gym. I was hesitant to pay the price; but, glad I did. Very happy with this purchase.', \"It has been 13 months since I purchased this one and left one started buzzing on transparent/NC mode. Just 1 month after warranty expires. I also have 2017 MacBook Pro with muffled sound problem. Apparently apple has issues with sound hardware/software integration area. I'll never buy an apple product that has something to do with sound I guess..\", 'The product is very well made and works well with all my apple products. The charging case is small and works very well. In order to reliably use the earphone, you can one at a time. This is a very high en product. If you want to learn the features, check the Apple website.', 'Update Stopped working in less than a year, no way to get any appointment with apple store these days Takes some time to get used to it after the regular AirPods, once you get the hang of it you wouldn’t want to go back.', 'Was hoping for a little more battery life but the noise cancellation is on point. Not the easiest to figure out how to use if you’re not familiar with using something like this before. If you have the money to spend on a product like this I would say go for it. Maybe not an impulse buy though.', \"By far the best earphones I've ever purchased. The quality of noise cancellation has made my wife easier to bare, and the battery life to keep out the bickering and arguing for prolonged periods of time is unbeatable. If you are thinking about buying it, please let me inform you that this is a necessity.\", 'Since all my tech is Apple save the TV integration with the AirPods has been seamless which adds to the overall enjoyment. Audio quality is what you would expect of this level of AirPod although the fit could be better, but that is a nit.', \"They don't stay in my ears very well but I bought some Earhoox and together with those I'd give it a 5 star rating.  But they won't stay in my ears on their own.  I love how they switch between my phone and computer.  Noice canceling is nice and I love that I can switch between transparency and noise canceling.\", 'So.  I already have the regular air pods.  Good. But fall out of my apparently large ear holes.  These babies stay in.  But.  Best feature.  Freaking noise cancellation!  Great on the train but also when I am working.  Am a transactional lawyer.  Contracts.  Gotta focus.  These babies are great for that. Love them.', 'Solid earbuds and I like that they’re water proof even though I’m still afraid to sweat in these too much. There is other brands (Beats/JBL/Sony) that sound better but these have decent battery life. Bummer is the volume only reaches a medium level with my iPod as there’s no volume control on the AirPods themselves. Go with Power Beats Pro for workout and loud bass/volume. Also these are over priced for what you get.', 'These air pods are amazing!  The sound is beyond good but the best part for me is that they do not hurt my ears - they are comfortable.  I had tried a couple of other brands and it was difficult to get them seated in my ears and they really hurt.  These cost a lot but not much more than some of the others that have must less quality.  I would buy them again!', 'I love these. Everything about them. Sometimes though my ears do start to hurt and I’ll have to take them out for a while', 'Easy to connect. You’d think for the price the connection would be somewhat stable. Continuously drops out, or disconnects for no apparent reason.  Sounds is ok, nothing special. Battery life is great. The buttons are awkward, the tap on the old Pros where much better. On these, you have to feel around the bud for some tiny button. So for the price, not a great value.', 'So I lost my original pods and decided to try out the new ones. Unfortunately I wasn’t impressed at all. Also if you’re not comfortable with pods with rubber inserts these are no different. Ears got tired and painful after about 30 min even with the different sized ear inserts. Also the bluetooth connection is s_ _ t! It crapped out on me after about a week of use so only one pod would work at a time even after numerous repairing attempts. It’s nice that the nub is shorter and less in the way but the actual head speaker is larger as well so beware of that for smaller ears. (Although with the different sized rubber inserts the issue of fit could be fixed. my opinion, Stay with the OG pods! Much more comfortable and cheaper too! And the sound proof qualities ate always much better with over the ear headsets in my opinion. Get the original AirPods for working out and everyday use and get a pair of Bose QC’s for you “not so soon” plane rides!:)', \"These are some of the best headphones I have ever had, including my Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pros. I love the noise cancelling for when I'm walking around in the city and the stem controls are great for media controls or switching between noise cancelling and transparency. They are very comfortable and so far they have held up to sweat pretty well while going on walks.\", 'I upgraded from the first AirPods model (no wireless charging case) for the noise cancellation features without having clunky over-the-ear headphones. While they don’t last as long as the other models, these are definitely worth spending the extra $100 over, especially if you consistently use earbuds daily. The only issues I’ve had are dealing with them falling out of my ears on the occasion, that’s likely due to the size of the ear tips.', 'I absolutely love these!! They are well worth the money!! I love that I can lay in bed and listen to music and not have to worry about wires! If I fall asleep with them, they stay in my ears! The sound cancellation in these are amazing too! They stay really well in my ears and I have tiny ears. I couldn’t be happier with these I just love them! I even bought a case on amazon for them. So cute!', \"I used it for two days since received this. The noise cancellation is great, the transparent mode is extremely useful to help you hear others without stopping the music(yeah I know.. I just don't want the music to stop) The sound quality is.. normal but enough for an earphone that will only for walking for flight. Almost the only AWESOME Apple product this year.\", 'My first order was delivered to a lock rural box but not mine. I waited for others in our multiple box location to tell me it was put in their box in error.  No one I contacted said they received them. I reported them lost. I received excellent service from Amazon and got them replaced immediately. Hard to keep them in my ears but I love them for my audio books and riding my bike!', 'I was told by a coworker that they were great , actually I own a pair of AirPods that they would fall sometimes when I exercise al I ended up trying these AirPods pair and the sound is not at all superior to the standard the notice cancellation does lot add any benefit at all , they still work good  good battery life but not that much better than regular iPods', 'Coming off of the PowerBeats Pro, I’m really liking the noise-cancellation as well as the passive feature which lets you hear what’s going on around you in top of the music for those late night strolls. Overall, a hit. I haven’t picked up my Powerbeats Pro since... One flaw = super slippery.', 'First off, the only reason i took one star off is because of how expensive it is even tho thats all apple products. The sound quality is great and i absolutely love the noise cancellation mode because i took these on the plane with me and it made the ride a lot better because u seriously couldnt hear anything, you couldn’t even hear the crying babies!! The battery lasts rly long and they fit so perfectly in my ear its scary because ive never had earbuds that fit comfortably. Overall i have no complaints', \"I was hesitating to purchase these, but I've got a chance to try it from friend of mine. I have literally small ears, and was worried how it will fit, but they're just perfect. nothing is falling down, they stay in place (ok, have to admit while wearing them for more than one hour, my ear is little tired), the noise cancellation is awesome and the best part is, you can use them separately. how they activate themselves when you put insert them in an ear is just nice cherry on the top\", '3 stars for great sound quality, noise cancellation as well as the transparency feature. Do not buy these if you’re looking for some gym ear buds though. They do not stay in your ear, they always pause when you push one of them back in and it’s annoying not being able to skip songs, answer phone calls, or press play without getting your phone out. For home, car, or office use these will do great!', 'After finding a x-ray of the case I took a dremel to my case so I can close and charge without removing the rubber ear hooks. Now the airpods pro are perfect. They will stay in very well and are easy to charge. I know most people will not do this to their case but without the AhaStyle AirPods Pro Ear Hooks on my airpods pro they would not stay in my ears even with the memory foam replacements. For me this is the perfect fix. No regrets. Added strip of electrical tape to help secure lid shut for when in pockets and such.', 'Unlike the standard AirPods that always seem about ready to fall out these are a solid and comfortable fit. The setup on Apple products is easy and very reliable. The noise cancellation is very good and the sound quality excellent.', 'Bought these for my girlfriends birthday and she’s beyond thrilled. She loves how the second she took them out of the package they were charged and came right up on her phone. She has told me she also loves how they know when you take them out of your ears; if she’s listening to music or watching something it automatically pauses and the second it’s back in her ear it’ll resume. You can also change the equalizer settings and volume per headphone, as well as the option to use only one headphone at a time. If she keeps ranting and raving about these, I may just have to get a pair myself!', \"When everyone else did not have these in stock, Amazon came through with them and I had them to put under my Christmas tree. I bought several sets for all of my sons. They said that the quality is so much better than the first AirPods. They love the noise-canceling feature. We took a trip on a plane shortly after they received these and couldn't hear the engines on the plane. I may have to get some for myself.\", 'The sound quality and noise cancellation are nowhere near as good as a Bose.  But they are reasonably good, and (having list an earlier pair) I appreciate the iPhone feature that tells you when they’ve been left behind (even though it goes off when they are in my pocket).', \"I have a samsung galaxy S9. These airpod pro's work excellent. Sound great and feel comfortable. If you have an android phone you can download a free third party app so you can see your battery life and have in ear detection. I use mine mostly at the office and at home and I would definitely recommend.\", 'I LOVE these.  Was not a fan of the prior generation. They perched too precariously in my ears.  These are snug, have great sound quality, and cancel noise well enough to make walking down a city street a pleasure.  My one warning is that they may not be secure enough for vigorous movement, but they’re fine for walking.', 'These are great earphones. The big complaint is that there is not an easy way to find them when you lose them. To ping them the case has to be open and you can barely hear the ping even when you have them in your hand. The “find my” feature also only works from the last place the case was opened. Lost the entire set in a month. Not great news at $250 a set.', 'I bought a Apple AirPods Pro before my purchase from Amazon. This has by far been the worst! I lost my previous ones and I thought it will be the same. Seems more like used or refurbished when it should be new. Making squeaking noise when open and closing. Charging port doesn’t work very well. Pretty disappointed. I’d suggest people to just Prder through apple directly. I hope the seller or Amazon does something regarding this.', \"I bought two of these at the same time for Xmas gifts.  One pair was already registered to another name and we returned right away.  The second pair worked fine for a few weeks and then began to malfunction however now the return period has expired. I can't find any indication that these were used or refurbished so I felt like I was buying a new set but it doesn't appear so!  I've been told by Amazon support that these had to be new because they were shipped directly from Apple.  I'm not very happy!!!!\", 'These are great. I had the older version originally. I’m so glad that I upgraded. The sound quality and noise reduction is amazing. They fit snugly in your ears. It’s so easy to make and receive calls hand-free as well.', 'I’ve grown accustom to high quality products from Apple, but the new AirPods Pro is simply a huge miss.  Test: touch your finger to the inside of your ear and either talk to someone or chew a piece of gum.  What do you feel? Of course you’re feeling your inner ear move. What do we do when we have our AirPods Pro in our ear you ask? We talk to people!  Well, the darn things will not stay in my ears. I’ve tried all 3 adapters and nope, they all fall out. But what happens even more often when I have to readjust them while talking,  I accidentally press the poorly positioned button that ends the call. Over and over again this happens. Now, try getting these things out of the case quickly when an important call is coming in?!?! Good luck!!  Too many dollars for an inadequate product. Apple, let’s get back to the original AirPods and simply make them noise cancelling and we will have a winner.', \"These fit your ears well, have great noise cancellation, and connect to iPhone well. The big drawback is that there is a known apple issue that still hasn't been resolved when using them with your mac for video conferencing or calls that renders them useless. When trying to do video conferencing or calls on a MacBook the sound quality is TERRIBLE, people consistently say my voice sounded muffled and gargled. I tried all known workarounds (having the computer use internal mic instead of Airpod pro mic, paying $5 for an app called Toothfairy that supposedly helps override this and forces computer to use AAC format, calling apple support, etc. No resolution available -- forums talk about this issue dating back over 7 years and Apple has chosen not to address it, rediculous.\", 'I literally take them everywhere. Wasn’t sold on them at first, and they were even uncomfortable for a while. But I changed the ear tips, and eventually my ears got used to them. Now I’m always using them, and everything sounds great! It even has an awesome feature that enhances certain sounds (transparency mode), I highly recommend these.', 'A major reason I got these was because with other earphones I found myself cranking the volume to try and tune out the outside or to get more depth from the music. With the noise cancellation, great fitting plastic buds, pressure system built in, & balanced sound quality I now have my volume at 40% max. So great!', \"These are amazing! I checked the serial code on apple and they are in fact real, brand new sealed in the box. I didn't know that the skip/play/ pause was different and its a little more difficult but i'm ok with that. They are super comfortable. the noise cancellation is very weird when not listening to anything, makes my head feel weird. I will hopefully get use to it. Over all worth it for 199.\", 'The ear tips that come with the AirPods are not secure.  They always felt like they were ready to fall out, which was disappointing.  I purchased  aftermarket tips and the AirPods now are secure.  Apple should change the tips.', 'Awesome product. Loud, clear, good bass and the noise canceling is great. It does everything I need it to. Also anyone who says “it’s a fake Apple product” are just paid trolls. You can literally go to Apples website once you receive them and confirm they are real with the serial code lol.', \"Bought this couple days ago, looks great, unfortunately the touch sensor is not functioning, couldn't answer any call. Asked for exchange. This time they just sent me a opened box without the headphones and charging case. This is unbelievable.\", 'These work great UNLESS you’re on the other end of the phone call. Whomever you’re talking with will hear every little noise. I mean EVERY SOUND. So bad I exchanged them because I thought they were defective.', 'So much better sound than the standard airpods.

The sound cancelation is awesome and you can even turn off the sound cancelation to hear everything around you.

I also discovered that my tinnitus (which usually is drowned out by background noise ) is now more obvious and annoying.  This will be an issue with any active noise canceling products, of course.', 'I bought these for my husband about 2 months ago he wears them non stop he is able to hear conversation much better and ppl can hear him. His mother wears hearing aids and could never hear him on the phone with these she can hear my husband on the phone like his sitting right next to her.', \"It hurts in my ears if I smile and despite the three different ear tips, these do still do not fit well in my ears. The transparency and noise cancellation features are nice and work as expected but for more than $200 I expect them to not constantly fall out of my ears when I move or feel uncomfortable when moving my facial muscles. They fall out if I sweat a little, walk, if I smile too big, or even when I am sitting and talking - basically all the time. I even used the ear tip fit test on the iPhone to make sure I had the best fit along with trying all the other ear tips and they still don't stay in my ears well.

I guess you get what you pay for! The noise cancellation is excellent, and they are completely plug & play with my iPhone. Very happy with my purchase!', 'Really really wanted to love these! Unfortunately, they fell out of my ears very often no matter which tip I used. They also hurt my ears and I will be returning. Sometimes they made high pitched noises when using the noise canceling. Resetting them made it go away. Pairs well with Apple products and wireless charging case is handy. Good sound and call quality, but for hoping for a better overall experience. If they didn’t hurt my ears so bad I might consider keeping. Although, I couldn’t get them to stay in well enough to use for working out or even walking:(. I think there are a few other brands that offer similar features, a better fit, and better sound quality.', 'I use them mostly for listing to audiobooks and classical & jazz music while walking and running.  They are great for blocking street noise.  It takes a bit of trial and error to get the earpieces sized correctly for a tight fit and you will find that using the noise cancellation and tight fit will make them somewhat uncomfortable after 3-4 hours.', 'The sound quality is horrendous.

Im not sure if this is defective or even fake', \"The pods tend to frequently disconnect from a Windows computer even after the bluetooth drivers have been updated, and power settings adjusted.

I ordered different earbuds to wear with them so I don't encounter the same problem as many others by them falling out of my ears.

I’m a bit of a cheap person so I wasn’t sure I wanted them but I’m glad I did get them. Only thing I hate is that apple gives you everything you need but not the charging block for the usb c to lighting cable (so dumb). So if you do buy them I’d recommend buying a block for them while you’re at it if you don’t have one already.', 'I got these Ipod Pros on sale around Black Friday. I have other brands of wireless ear buds but not ones with noise cancellation so I tried these out. I have loved the sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life.

That's how much I use them!\", 'Love the pods. Leaves my charge port on my phone available and I don’t have a cord to get tangled in. The noise canceling works great and I like the transparency mode too. The only thing is the battery life is short and it doesn’t come with the charge plug. You get the usb-c cord, but if you don’t have a Mac or a usb-c port to charge the pods with, you’ll have to buy the plug adapter to get the quick charge. But otherwise great earbuds!', 'Love how the infos for battery pops on your device. They seem great and I’m finally glad I splurged (while they were on sale)! The sound quality is good, the noise cancellation is great. The Bluetooth connection slows down during my virtual medical appointments and the reason for 3 stars-my other Bluetooth EarPods don’t affect connectivity', \"I was excited to try out the AirPods pro and see how they compare with other truly wireless earbuds. The Pro's were going to serve as my on the go earbud as well, something I might take to the gym. I like the idea of these earbuds, but the execution is severely flawed. I have no problem paying a premium price for a superior product. Unfortunately, the sound quality of AirPods Pro does not translate at all to the sticker price. The noise-canceling and transparency modes are nice features to have but still don't justify the price point or improve upon the audio quality. If you're looking for an ok sounding earbud that easily syncs up with all your Apple products, this is it. However, if you don't want to spend over $220 or want higher fidelity audio, there are better options out there.\", 'Excellent sound quality, noise cancellation and battery life. Easy setup, operation and charging. Very comfortable. My husband tried mine and was so impressed he wants a pair now, like NOW. Done! Just ordered a 2nd pair, they should arrive in a day or two.', 'Must have especially if you enjoy listening to music or podcast and keeping an ear out for what’s going on around you.

I am not the only person this has happened to.  I called Apple and the AirPods are still under warranty, so I'm replacing them.  Fingers crossed this one works longer than a month.\", 'I just purchased these this past week and when they came immediately I had connection issues. They would not connect for a day and had to go through many steps in order for the “seem less” connection. After I did get them to connect the first time, however, they have been connecting fine. Another issue was the left AirPod was not charging. It was in the case for a long time (again brand new) and it was not charging or holding charge. I had to clean the charging port of the brand new case in order for it to charge. Overall, it works fine now, but some issues for brand new AirPod pros.', 'If you don’t have an Apple phone phone, don’t bother. Apple severely limited to audio output from android phones. At max volume it is almost to low. Noise cancellation is great but the audio output is still way too low on Android.

I keep one in my ear all day. When I see its low on power I switch it out with the other. It works with only one in at a time. Is great hearing and speaking. It won’t fall out like the AirPod 1 and 2. I bought the earpiece to help keep them in my ear but the Pro’s don’t need that, they stay in working out or just around the house.', 'Went to the Apple Website to register the serial number and it was not valid. Talked with someone in Customer Service via chat and they said there was nothing they could do and I had to deal with Amazon. Its not like they are any cheaper here, just get them directly from Apple is my advice.', 'I recently switched to iPhone and realized I’d have to get some blue tooth headphones. After a friend of mine convinced me to purchase these, I must say that I’m BLOWN AWAY by the positive impact they’ve had on my state of mind. They work seamlessly with iOS and hold their charge longer than any others I’ve had. I can’t speak to the quality of sound compared to the original model, but I think they sound great! Super convenient. I just love them!', 'Sound quality is outstanding along with the battery. I have had issues with the ear fit but my major concern is inability to transfer podcasts from phone to pods along with deleting unwanted ones. This problem is not related to quality of air pods & I can most likely address the situation when Apple stores reopen', 'Functionally for apple centric people they are great! The noise canceling is pretty good for in ear headphones and the fit is awesome. The only downside is the sound quality and 4.5 hour battery life. You’d expect a lot more from headphones that cost as much as these do. Don’t get me wrong, they sound pretty good but are quite anemic in bass. I have quite a few pairs of in ear headphones and the clarity on these leaves something to be desired.  The only time these come alive is when watching a movie in 3D sound mode. Overall I would buy them again as they are a perfect companion for iPhone users.', 'If you don’t already have AirPods, these are five stars. If you already have AirPods, you don’t need to buy these, there’s basically no difference between AirPods Pro and AirPods Gen 2. I bought these for the noise canceling feature but it’s barely noticeable. Not worth it. Returning.', 'it would’ve lasted me a year if my baby cousin hadn’t chewed up the earpieces. i don’t have them anymore but i would definitely buy them again. i sometimes used them in the shower (i didn’t soak them under the water) but steam or little splashes seem to do nothing to it. perfect 10/10', \"The sound quality is good. Noise cancelling is good and battery life is good, but the fit is terrible. I've tried every size of the silicon end pieces. The Air Pods fall out constantly. I have taken to putting over ear, hearing protecting ear muffs to catch them when they fall out when I'm outside.  I should also note that I have normal sized ears, so I wanted to warn people. These very expensive earphones will fallout on you.\", 'The only negative review has nothing to do with the purchase of this product. Unfortunately, I lost the left airpod within a week of purchasing it. Since then I bought accessories to help secure the airpods should one fall out of my ear.', 'Bought these for the noise cancellation, there is NO noise cancellation. At best they muffled the back ground noise like car engine or air conditioning but anything verbal (television, husband talking, etc) came through louder and clearer. As for music quality...the plug in ear buds that came with my iPhone are far superior in sound quality and the amount of available volume. Very disappointed in these AirPod Pros that came highly recommended.', 'Too heavy and the right bud doesn’t even work. I’m not an every day user of any type of ear buds so I just kept thinking the battery was dying before I got to use. Finally realized yesterday that I was shipped a broke product because the right ear piece has no sound. Should have bought a another cheap pair that lasts me a few years and then used the rest of the money to get something else. Happy bday to me, NOT!', \"Not what I expected. I now understand why music lovers hate wireless earbuds so much. This is a good product, but at $250 I was expecting to have my mind blown. The sound isn't bad, but I would call it just a basic. Also bass is just meeh. It's there, but you won't be impressed\", 'I love these more than is healthy. I used to use the corded headphones to talk on the phone. They would disconnect, fall out, or just get tangled. These air pods connect immediately. They sound great and are so easy to use. I also have been using them as a mic for my videos and they are better than the external mic I had. They are truly amazing! Also, I have small ears and the smallest ear things fit fine.', \"I was worried about the comments saying this is fake but that definitely wasn't the case (or I might just be one of the lucky customers). The product is legit and came in complete package. I live outside the US at it took about 3 weeks before I got it (used forwarder). Really nice sound but I honestly do not see any difference using the standard earpods and the airpods pro, except that the latter has noise cancellation. Battery life is okay but this is fairly new so I can't say. Maybe it will depend on your usage. My iPhone XR is already 3 years old and the battery is still at 83%. Will probably replace phone when it reaches its 5 years mark.\", \"With apple, you are never disappointed. Great product. I love how easy is to change the source of the sound between my mac and my iPhone. The airpods are always connected to all devices. It's just amazing. And the noise cancellation is impressive. The only problem they have is that in 1-2 years when the battery will die, I will have to throw them away. Irreparable product.\", 'I spent a lot of money and time with other headphones but these are amazing! Given the fact that they’re expensive, they’re definitely worth it! The sound quality is marvelous and the noice cancellation feature is out of this world. Also, the transparency mode allows you to hear your stuff but at the same time you’re aware of your exteriors. Regarding the battery life, I charge it every 3 to 4 days with an average use time of 4 hours a day.  Thanks Apple!', 'Unfortunately it doesn’t work for a lot of people, me included. It does not stay in the ear no matter what you do. If you’re ok purchasing different ear tips online, then that might work. For those who have \"normal ears”, it has Very good noise cancellation and battery life.  Sound quality is great but only with a well fit ear tip and with a good seal. Also, With a good seal spatial audio is activated and acoustic performance is pretty good. Of course all that doesn’t matter if it doesn’t actually stay in the air.', \"Noice canceling! I don't think so. I hear everything around me.  Returned under recall and same thing with new updated pair. Almost no difference with noice canceling on or off. Slight difference in transparency mode. Not very loud either. Need volume up 75% to be listenable.  Use with iPhone 12 Pro\", 'if you like listening to music with headphones that are comfy, block out outside noise, and you don’t have to turn up to block out the noise, these are the headphones for you. Although they are 250 dollars, once you buy them you know you spent your money well. the sound quality is crisp and clear however, if your more of a bass heavy person, go to the settings of whatever music platform you are using and turn on bass boost. the noise cancellation is amazing for when your riding the bus, in a gym, or even on planes. voices won’t get completely blocked out but they do get a lot quieter. also, if your a workout type of person or you wear headphones in the rain these are perfect, just wouldn’t recommend using them in the rain all the time.', \"I originally was debating whether to buy Beats X for the third time, on average the last me about a year and a half.. Instead I went with these, boy should I have done that sooner. The sound quality is great, the noise cancelation is incredible for how portable these are (i'm used to bose noise canceling, and these are almost as good as those).\", 'The AirPod Pros are worth the money if you plan on using them often. The quality is awesome and I love the noise cancellation feature. I’ve used my airpods at work, at the gym, and just cleaning around the house…. Yes, these guys stay in! Again, while these guys are really good, I wouldn’t get them if you don’t plan on wearing them often. They’re quite pricey!', 'I feel mislead, I don’t see anywhere, where I was buying a used product. This box has clearly been opened and clear wrapper not there—- is it refurbished? It’s clearly marked that it’s been given a second home so to speak ... I thought I was buying a new product and looking at the reviews other ppl opened new products so did I miss something?', 'I love the sound of these but I ended up getting the Power Beats as they last 8 hours.  The air pods do have a better sound.  I also got the Air Play Pros but they keep bouncing out of my ears and they only lasted 3 1/2 hours.', \"They said it could use a Qi-certified wireless charging station. Fake news! I used a famous cellphone maker's brand wireless charging station. After 30 seconds of charging, it stops. Tried several other brands products, I found this. If your charging station has more than 5W capability, sorry, no use. If you have a super old or cheap one, bingo! you are good to go!!!.\", 'I absolutely LOVE these!  The noise cancellation is a really good benefit. I am in the middle of a home remodel and have been using them for air protection while running compressors and other equipment. I can listen to music comfortably and not miss any phone calls or texts.', 'I had no idea that these AirPods would change my life - just thought they would be a nice upgrade for audio. The combination of sound cancelling and listening to music has brought a new calm to my work while sheltering in place. This is the first time in my life I can listen to music with lyrics AND be able to focus on my work. Days are so peaceful, calm and productive.', 'The sound quality is amazing. I purchased these to pair with my iPhone easier. One thing about these that I don’t like is that they don’t stay in my ear. I have tried all three sizes and they don’t stay. They will start slipping out even when you’re just sitting listening to music. But if you’re like me and you love music and hearing the intricacies of sound, then these are definitely the right thing for you.', 'So I\\'m sure plenty of people will point out that the quality of sound that you get, leaves something to be desired. I have found that the \"world mute\" button is incredibly relaxing for what little anxiety I have. I\\'m talking about the noise cancellation... and it\\'s pretty good. I would not advise them for use on a long flight or in a car for long periods, but in a crowd walking around... it\\'s perfect. Other than that, they are awfully comfortable for a while... the battery life is nothing to complain about. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase and my wife believes them to be the best gift she\\'s ever gotten.', \"The fit of these is a little strange. I usually use small ear tips but for these I had to use large so it wouldn't hurt the cartilage above my ear hole. The sound is great but noise cancelation could use some improvement. The right earphone drains battery faster and has a bit more difficulty connecting to the phone when I put it in my ear. Sometimes I have to put it back in the case then take it out again for it to connect properly. It has a few flaws but overall a good purchase for someone who doesn't want to deal with wires.\", \"When they work, they are amazing. Best in the market. This is my second set now. I returned the first set to get a replacement. They are all the same. The contacts inside the case are not very well designed. I have to nudge the pods at a special angle in the case otherwise they might not charge, and I wake up to a dead earphone. It's absolutely annoying.\", 'I love the sound. But the tips feel like they jump out my ears. Did the fit test on the small and large and I will be buying some Comply foam tips to rectify the issue. I have to rate the AirPod Pros a 3 because I can’t justify telling people to buy a product that they will probably lose if they wear it outside or running.', 'I previously owned the beatsx with foam tips and that set up proved better sound and passive noise cancellation than the AirPods. I like to think it’s because the silicone tip on the AirPods do not cover my ear canal completely. I do recommend these over the regular AirPods due to the noise cancellation and silicon tips. I personally would not even bother with the regular AirPods after using these.', \"I really wanted to like these. I bought them for the gym, bike riding, maybe even for listening at my desk. Unfortunately, I can't get them to stay in my ears. I've tried all the sizes but none work. The right one stays in with the medium tip but the left just pops out no matter what. I can't really assess the sound quality and other aspects since I can't keep them in long enough to make a judgement.\", 'Sound & noise cancellation is nice.  Battery and comfort I expect better from Apple.  Does not stay in ear.  Had to buy memory foam replacement ends. Plus no way of charging without buying a new block or adapter. Would rather pay and get a square or something where I could charge.', \"Everyone knows these are great headphones, in fact I'd say they do too good of a job with the noise cancellation, but you can turn it off when necessary.  The only issue I have is that my husband & I both have a pair and it causes issues all the time.  Mine have never been paired to his phone or his to my phone, but that doesn't stop them from pairing up to the wrong phone all the time, especially during phone calls...That being said, I'd still buy them again and deal with it because they are very good headphones.\", 'I read the “fake” reviews and ordered anyway. These are NOT FAKE. They are real Apple products. And so far, I am happy. The custom fit ear buds fit my ears so much better! The originals always fell out of my ears, and seeing why since I wear the small in the custom fit. Definitely worth the extra money for me. And the noise cancellation is a bonus. Now it won’t cancel out a person talking or a lawn mower, but simple noises, yes.', 'These are the best Bluetooth headphones I’ve ever owned. I was going to give it a 4 for battery life but to be fair, they are really small so that had to be taken in to consideration. Something to note, noise cancellation and transparency modes will burn the battery faster. On normal mode, I get about 3-4 hours of listening time out of them but they do charge really fast in the case and the case has a really good battery life. Never had a problem with them falling out of my ears but I would suggest getting some sort of lanyard if you are going to run with them or do a lot of head movement.', 'They fall out of my ears, I’ve tried three after-market solutions that didn’t work. Also, they randomly connect and disconnect, maybe related to the aftermarket foam ear pieces, I don’t know. I’m not the only one with this problem, must be a solution', 'I had some damage to my AirPod s, they were older, and so I was on the fence wether to upgrade to prod or not. I did and hate them. They fall out often, the battery doesn’t last as long and there connectivity is shotty. Often I have to put them in and out of the case a few times for them to register even if the case is charged, overall they don’t connect /stay connected as well as my AirPods did.', 'These headphones are really awesome but not perfect, especially for the actual price at apple. I did get it for cheaper at amazon and I would say maybe it was worth it. The best feature is the \"spatial\" feature on these. Unreal. Unfortunately, the silicone tips do not stay on 100% no matter what size. These are the few reasons why I can\\'t give it a full 5 stars.', \"5 stars for one specific reason - they stay in my ear while talking, laughing, eating, and walking around.  Apple nailed the balance on theses, they shift slightly but don't come out on their own when my jaw moves around or my ears flex from talking.\", 'I took a chance & ordered these from Amazon. Normally I would purchase all my Apple products directly from Apple, but these were on sale during the Christmas holiday through Amazon. The sound quality is top notch, but I would expect nothing less from an Apple product. I would highly recommend them.', 'The air pods pro Are great Pros Great sound Mics sound clear like you’re not talking on Bluetooth earbuds Good battery life 5 hours and about 5 mins Case charges earbuds quickly Cons They don’t stay in my ears with out 3rd party Accessory’s Don’t come in black not really a con lol The price im buying another pair i want 2 pair', 'I use these every day, for phone calls, zoom calls, to listen to music, etc... The only complaint I have is if I bend down they fall out of my ear. I have tried to use the smallest to the largest earbuds but they fall out. Otherwise I really like everything else about them.', 'Bought a pair of cheap ear buds a while back. Thought I was a genius saving the money. THEY SUCKED. After a week the left one stopped working. Maybe these things are expensive but they are great. The noise cancelling is worth the price alone', 'Love these AirPods, quality to the max, and the technology is premium. The noise canceling is excellent. And I love all of the automatic features. The one thing I hate about these AirPods because you cannot raise the volume from the AirPod. Siri has to do it for you which is annoying. Other than that great product', 'These are by far the best wireless headphones I have ever had. Great noise cancellation, when I mow the lawn and can’t hear the lawnmower at all. Small package which is nice to carry in my backpack. Strongly recommend since they pair well with non apple electronics as well.', 'They don’t stay in ears no matter which size ear bud u try from Apple. Constantly falling out onto floor then pushing them back in my ear and accidentally hanging up phone calls. The battery life was terrible! Returned them. Their flawed', \"They are made by Apple what more can I say? They perform well and the first gens I had worked great for 3 years then the battery life began to diminish. I expect 3 year out of these as well, my only issue with them or how they fix in your ears. Somehow Apple hasn't figured out that out yet but I guess we all have different air canals so....\", \"Great product, completely legit I was skeptical at first but they're real apple airpods pro so I got a silicone protective case and a clip so I can transport them easily, the charging case alone scratches very easily so its best to buy a case right away\", 'I think they’re overpriced for the quality and the fact that it slips out of my ears regardless of the various sized buds and the fit test they have. But it’s convenient and I like the noise cancelling mode. It’s battery lasts a decent amount of time before I have to charge it again. It uses USB-C and didn’t come with a block which is ridiculous but luckily I had one from my iPhone. Overall three stars.', 'Okay so In general there okay. One HUGE issue. They will all of a sudden just pause my music on Spotify. Will do it every one or 2 minutes. Sometime I’ll be good for 15 min sometimes 30. I’ve had them for 5 days and the annoyance is unbearable. I just want to listen to what I want in peace without having to unpause all the time. I read that you have to turn off the proximity sensors, but the recognition to pause and unpause when I pull them out of my ears was literally the best feature of the gen 1s I’d rather just have the gen 1s.', 'Finally got the great sounding apple airpods pro from Amazon for discounted price. They sound great with decent (not great) noise cancellation, but definietly meets all my needs. Compared to the Powerbeats Pro, I would say the powerbeats has more deep bass than these, but the bass on these are just decent. $250 from Apple is on the high side, so I highly recommended these especially for the discount from Amazon.', 'I love my AirPods Pros so much! True story: the first time I put them on I was in a BUSY Starbucks. The noise-cancelling feature activated the moment  I put in the second AirPod and was SO good I thought I was having a stroke, so I grabbed the nearest table to steady myself. Well played, Apple...', 'Revolutionary product with super noise cancellation technology, sound quality and battery life. Easy to carry. The only problem is that they slip out from my ears sometimes and one of them almost fell into the hole of my sink! I hope there could be some anti-slippery design on the AirPods body.', 'I like the product Pros: Noice cancellation both active and passive which is good for making calls and music for the average user. IPx4 rated for water resistance which is good during workout but they are not waterproof, so be careful. Great connectivity for Apple ecosystem. Wireless charging is also a plus Cons: battery life is decent not great. The mids are good but the highs and the base is decent.', 'I treated myself to iPod pro’s when I got my $1400 stimulus. I need less TV and more music. The sound quality of these buds is beyond approach. Perfect combo of past buds. The corded ones would always fall out of my ears. These babies stay put. I’m so in love with them. My favorite thing.', 'After going through multiple other vendors products, thought I would give these a try.  What a mistake!  The Airpods will not stay in my ears.  I have tried all three sizes of earbuds that come with the unit and all of them fall out.  Very frustrating as it defeats the whole point of having these. Would not recommend until Apple fixes this serious usability issue.', 'When I first received the earbuds I was very happy. I am a techno-nerd and setting up the earbuds with my devices was amazingly simple. It practically does it by itself. The quality is exceptional. But now that I have had them for a few weeks, I have stopped using them.  I am a therapist currently seeing clients through telehealth and they fall out constantly.  I changed the size of the pads and it makes no difference.  They are too expensive not to send back.', 'These are my first AirPods I’ve ever gotten, at let me tell you that these are great for listening to music and watching movies/TV shows. Sound quality is good, and the active noise cancellation really does quiet out background noises. There is also an option to allow your AirPods to amplify background noise so you can listen for sounds in your environment. Battery life is only like 4 hours if you have the noise cancellation on at all times but even when it’s off you’ll still get like 5 hours. When you’re ready to take them off and put them in your pocket, they charge inside the small carrying case.', 'This is the best wireless headphone I ever bought. The only thing is that you can’t adjust volume , you have to adjust from your phone. It does automatically do noise canceling , I found it out when I was mowed my lawn. I have the BOSS before this is much much better . It has only less than 4 hours battery charge .', 'Was excited but... Will not disconnect from my phone. When I put them back and close the case they keep playing in the case. Apparently this is a common issue and I’m not willing to pay over 200 dollars for headphones that don’t work like they are supposed to. I don’t know if they are remanufactured but not worth it in my opinion.', \"I haven't been able to go to an apple store due to the pandemic, one came fully broken and unlistenable in ANC, and the other mode, it's like I listen to myself. I don't know if it's a factory issue but I can't even go to an apple store to have it checked.\", 'These are good earbuds. If you are using this with an iPhone they are a great pick. They sound pretty good and have different ear tip sizes. The noise cancellation is pretty good but in some situations if you don’t have the volume somewhat high you can still hear the muffled noise. However I’ve had some issues. Sometimes pairing would have some issues and I would have to forget and reconnect. Also I had an issue where sound setting wouldn’t change when being changed in menu. These also are not the most durable I would recommend a case. But if you can look past these issues these are very good earbuds.', 'Very easy to use for home office and travel.  I usually use these to join conference calls and since im working from home now, I use them non stop.  Overall great asset to have now that I am working from home.', 'Great sound and really like the noise cancellation and active listening. I feel like the headphones don’t last the 4.5 hr time per use as described. For the price they should last much longer but that’s my only compliant.', 'The wired earphones ALWAYS drove me nuts. Yes, they were a great improvement from what we had before but the wires were forever tangling around your hands, your listening device, yanking one of the earplugs out, etc. The Apple AirPods Pro are simply the best!', 'I’ve had the 2gen AirPods. And I ordered these because they’re supposed to be better.  They won’t stay in my ear.  People keep saying they can hear everything around me (supposed to be noise canceling). The battery life is horrible.  I may get 1 hour of playtime. I’m very disappointed', 'I’m very disappointed with this apple product.  They only charge if you fiddle around with them when you put them in the charger.  I had the pods replaced just a few days ago and the same thing is happening.  If they are charging and you move the case they will lose its connection.  What good is a portable charging case if the air pods lose their charging connection. Sound and noise canceling are excellent.  Doesn’t do much good if you charged them for a future walk only to find out they didn’t charge.', 'It was a tough decision to buy these at first, but after lots of research I believe I made the right choice! The Airpods Pro have much better sound than the predecessors, have great transparency and noise cancellation modes, and most importantly STAY IN YOUR EARS! The original Airpods would always \"fall out\" of my ears and I would constantly adjust them every few minutes or so, and seeing that the Pros have tips that go in the ear definitely pushed my decision to buy these. After they arrived, I immediately put them in and tried the different modes and was just amazed with everything about the Pros. I haven\\'t had any problems with them yet, whereas I\\'ve had several with the original Airpods. This purchase was definitely worth it, and I love my Airpods Pro. I would also suggest getting a simple silicone case for them to preserve and protect the white case. My original Airpods case has tons of scratches and I\\'m assuming the Airpods Pro case would be no different.', \"Prior to owning any AirPods, it was recommended to get the regular ones as the Pros weren't worth it.  I ended up with the non-Pros at first, then upgraded.  Pros are comfortable, sound better and noise cancellation works great for me.  Highly recommended!\", 'I love all things Apple but I resisted buying these AirPods for as long as I could. Pros: sound quality, noise cancellation (perfect for ignoring my teen ) and good battery life. Cons: I love them really. I changed the earpiece because the original ones were a bit to big. I don’t completely like the fit but I just shove them back in. I would say if you can splurge get them. Think of it as an investment. It really is actually. I have no regrets.', 'I had bought Sony &. Beats air pods & there is no comparison. These Apple Air Pods Pro do everything they say they will do. The battery lasts a long time & finally the person that I’m talking to can hear what I’m saying & understand what I’m saying. They may be more expensive, but worth every penny!!!!! I love, love, love them!!! 😊😊😊', 'I understand I did not purchase these brand new, I purchased and paid $204. for the used ones titled, “VERY GOOD” and I was disgusted!! They couldn’t clean the ear buds that were DIRTY and had caked on EAR WAX??? It was absolutely disgusting and off putting!!!! Really??? It was disgusting!!!!🤢🤮 I’m taking them back and I’ll spend the extra money to buy them BRAND NEW! So disgusted! Overall-just pay the extra money for brand new ones so you don’t get this crap sent to you!!! AND time out of my day to go back to UPS to wait in a long long to return them!!!!! SO UPSET!!!', 'This is a nice Airpods with great sound and pretty good noise canceling feature.

Also, it is ~double the weight as the regular airpods.', \"After 5 off brand ear pods for my iPhones/Ipad, I finally went with what works best, AirPods Pro.  My only gripe is the lack of bass for my taste.  The off brands have better sounding bass, but don't last as long. These are the best overall ear pods for the Iphones.\", \"A solid, easy to use product with great sound, but pay attention to anchoring them in your ears, as they can fall out and roll away.  That's not usually a problem, but can be a challenge in tight places like an airplane.\", 'Not sure why these are rated so high. I have had both versions of the Apple EarPods and I admit the non noise cancelling version eliminate little noise but for the extra $100 the noise cancelling version doesn’t do much better. I returned them. I also own the Bose noise cancelling EarPods and they. Are great. They cost more but worth the money.', \"I like the way they automatically connect to my Apple device when taking them out of the case.  I can also keep the volume at low levels, and the music is very clear.  Some complain about not enough bass, but I think it's just right!\", 'These are expensive, but so worth it.  I wasted money on the cheap ones.  The sound quality for music is great and calls are crystal clear on both sides of the call. I like the feature to have an option to hear what is going on around me while listening to music or cancelling the noise out.', 'Very disappointed in the new AirPods. They costs so much money already and are not secure in the ear. Buying additional tips.. why should I have to after I paid so much for the item itself? I tried it anyways and it still falls out of my ear! Returned for a full refund. Stick with the other AirPods if you like working out in them like me.', 'Be Careful if you are prone to dizziness and Vertigo, ever since using these I have had to return them because every time I use them I end up getting dizzy and get vertigo, really bad episodes, not sure if its the noise cancellation, there are multiple articles on this so just a word of caution.', 'I’m glad I was able to grab these on Amazon for a slightly better price than what I’ve been seeing. They are great and the noise canceling is so good I thought it was a fluke!!!? So I’m definitely impressed and thankful that they are living up to their worth.', 'These are not the latest/greatest editions (now charging with USB-C vs. Lightning), but the sound quality and especially the noise canceling are the benchmark/baseline for the marketplace.  Simply put - you may find earbuds of equal sound quality, but not better.', 'My son just opened these tonight for his birthday... I’m very disappointed that there isn’t an adapter included for the charger case. The only thing it came with was a cable that doesn’t fit ANY of our other Apple electronics. Spending 250.00 for an item only to find out when it is open that there are still additional pieces to purchase is very irritating!', 'Sound quality is the same as the previous model and the wired versions.  The noise canceling feature makes them worth the price.  Plus the new ones offer a better fit then the previous model.', 'AirPods Pro are great. I’ve really got nothing bad to say about them, other than I expected the sound quality to blow me away. The sound quality is nothing to complain about, just not what I expected. The active noise cancellation is very nifty, and I think everyone can find it convenient. Going from sound transparency to noise cancelling with the squeeze of a button is insanely nice. I’ve also never had an issue with battery life and I’ve listened to music for hours on end. One feature I’d enjoy is comparability with Windows PC/Sony consoles to use as a gaming headset. They work for sound but not for microphone. I’d purchase these again, they’re very nice to have.', 'Pairing is extremely easy on any Apple device! I switch between multiple apple devices a few times a day- and apple made it very easy to transition from one to another Sound quality and Noise canceling is very good - although there are better options for audiophiles. Highly Recommend', 'I bought these 10-12 days ago and since then I’m using it all the time. I loved the way it isolates surrounding noise through its active noise cancellation. The sound quality is better than my Beats Pro even though they have same H1 processor chip in them. I felt the AirPod pros are little better than beats. The bass has improved way better than the previous versions of AirPods. The only negative point I noticed is the price. Overall, they works just fine.', 'I was super excited to get these from Amazon at such a great price! I opened my SHRINK-WRAPPED box, and upon opening the case, noted that these were not new, as advertised, but had been USED! My iPhone and iPad identified the Airpods Pro as someone else\\'s name, and there was earwax leftover on the L earbud. I immediately opened a chat with Amazon Prime, and they were going to replace them...however, now the item is \"out of stock\" and I will have to wait until they get more to send me my replacements. Extremely disappointed. They did \"make it up to me\" by giving me a $10 promotional code.', 'It worked fine for a month until the right charging sensor in the case broke. The right AirPod wouldn’t have any audio because the case still thought it was charging even when it was out. Even before it broke, the right AirPod always charged slower than the left one. I ended up returning these and just got one from Best Buy.', 'I recently purchased the Apple AirPod Pro during Prime Day.  The whole apple unboxing is exactly what you would expect.  Everything was packaged very neatly.  Pairing to your iPhone was a very easy process.  The sound quality was pretty close to my Bose Quiet Comfort 35.  The noise cancellation was perfect, however, sometimes my left earbud would think that my left earbud wasn’t in, so I was unable to use the noise cancellation.  Easy fix was to put back in the charger, then take it back out.  Battery power was great and charging from fast.  I would recommend this product.  I haven’t done a workout wearing these yet.', 'I was unsure of it at first, but believe me it’s worth it. The noise cancellation blocks anybody whose constant talking annoys you.

Highly recommend these!', \"Heard a lot of great things about the AirPods over the years, never thought that they were worth the price. Decided to finally give them a try. Great sound, noise cancellation is passable, and the battery is pretty strong. Been using them in the gym for awhile now, and they do an alright job of keeping me in the zone. Just need a pair to take out more casually - I've already come close to losing these a couple of times!\", 'Felt like I wouldn’t like these after refusing to get the original AirPods but I fell in love with them! Very nice upgrade from the AirPods 2 with noise cancellation and the ability to change to transparency mode. Took me a bit to get used to it but overall they’re pretty solid. I prefer these over the Beats wireless pros as they feel more comfortable during long usage.', \"I have the original Air Pods but received the Air Pod Pro for Christmas. Since then, I can't live without them. They are in my ears probably 60% of my work day. They are also great for home life. I listen to things on my computer without disrupting my husband. I highly recommend these.\", 'These were my first airpods and I fell in love with them instantly. I was at the airport gate, popped them in, and then \"schwooooop,\" silence as the active noise cancellation turned on. Then I press Play on my podcast with the volume down low, and I could still hear it flawlessly. Then used them to watch a movie on the plane, and the  movie sounded better than on my tv at home.', 'I bought these in spring 2020. In spring 2021 had a crackling issue and had to send in for repairs which were covered by warranty. A few months later and now noise cancellation not working. They said to send in and they would let me know how much to fix !  These are way too expensive to expect people to pay for repairs for faulty product after a little more than a year of use. Disappointed in apple quality control on these AirPod Pros', 'Although they are quite expensive I am happy with my purchase. They fit well and the box comes with different sizes to fit your own ear. They have several options on setting etc. typical apple product. I do prefer the pros over the regular AirPods', 'At first I was skeptical about the product arriving empty in its box due to some of the 1 star reviews stating “no AirPods inside the box”. And I, was hesitant wether I should purchase it or not at first the package was lost, Luckily I was able to order a replacement and I was still worried if the AirPods would arrive in bad condition or it would be a fake pair of AirPods. Fortunately it was a pair of authentic AirPods Pro plus in good condition. I was amazed with some of its new features stated in the description (Noise cancellation, transparency mode and spatial audio, etc) Absolutely the best 200$ I’ve spent on a pair of AirPods!. Totally recommend it!', 'These sound very good and work great with Apple Watch. So far i have not been able to shake them out of my eat but a serious sweat test is still needed. I did have to get a replacement pair sent since the first time i received the package it had an empty AirPods box that somebody in the supply chain had apparently Removed the plastic stolen the contents.', \"sound was great.  they paired easily.  everything is pretty much awesome about these like everyone says it is, except for this fact: no matter which tips i used, they just wouldn't stay put in my ears. Regular Airpods work better for me; they don't sound as great, but they stay put better.\", \"The best earbuds I've ever used. I didn't believe people when they said how good these were until I got my hands on some for myself. They were paired almost instantly as soon as I took them out of the box. The noise cancellation is incredible!!!! And the transparency mode makes it possible to keep your AirPods in while checking out at the grocery store or any situation like that. These are awesome and WELL worth the $180 price point I paid for them. I HIGHLY recommend these.\", 'They don’t sit in my ears very well even trying the different size buds.  Hopefully I can find some aftermarket ones soon. I do like the noise canceling especially at work where we are all sitting in half cubes. The sound is also way better than beats pro wireless ( which I use for the gym and running since they won’t fall off).', 'I bought the AirPods Pro a bit ,less than 14 months ago and now regret buying them from Amazon. For the past 3 months they have been charging unevenly intermittently. Lately the right one lasts a fraction as long as the left pod. And now the right one doesn’t charge at all. I wish I had bought them directly  from Apple so I could at least have a hope of getting them replaced. Because for the price, this longevity is outrageous. Very dissatisfied with this purchase! Think about where you are purchasing and the likelihood of needing replacement in about a year.', 'I’m a big Apple person myself but I have to be honest sound quality isn’t all there. I have some Bose earbuds and those are good but don’t have noise cancellation. I do like how easy and fast it is to connect to AirPods and the noise canceling is good.', 'I absolutely adore my AirPods pro. I’ve gone through about 13 different wireless earbuds. Whether it be sennheiser momentum, JBLs, AKGs, Bose, the origional AirPods and beats. I really disliked all of them. But these AirPods pro hit the perfect point. They’re comfortable, they fit properly, they have excellent noise cancellation and pass through; and to top it all off the sound quality is very good. This device hits all of the right spots. I highly recommend them.', 'Compared to the non pro versions, definitely worth the money. Connecting to devices is super easy, rest easier in ear, controls are fast n responsive. The ability to switch between transparent mode and ANC mode is amazing, transparency mode really does make you forget you have them in your ears. Wish I bought a pair of these sooner.', 'I bought these as a gift to myself for a new job and I love them except for whatever tf the material the ear bud tips are made of. They kept slipping out of my ears regardless of which size I used. Eventually I gave up and bought a memory foam pair and those are perfect! I wish I didn’t have to buy an additional accessory for this to work but here we are.', 'I ordered these in June of 2021. By November the right air pod started to mess up. It’s almost as if the noise cancellation part turns off and on rapidly and sounds like it is vibrating my ear drum. It is very uncomfortable and sometimes turning the noise cancellation off manually works but it also seems like the air pod is trying to still turn it off and on its self.', 'I say almost only because of a small movement with the lid on the case. But it is very small and the lid still closes perfectly. I highly recommend buying this product, I paid 190$, it is always on sale so wait for it to reach this price then go for it. They also fit perfectly in my ear straight out the box. All of the issues I read online are not true, at-least for mine.', 'I had been using it AirPod from first generation so when I see that new AirPod relieve I was so excited for it but I have to give comment on it. The sound quality is very good but compare to air pod I will say it is not a huge improvement. The noise cancel is actually working when the music is on but your will still hear the sound when the music is pause so it not as good as a headphone The battery is still very outstanding as most of the Apple product that I am getting But the price is a bit to pricey for it wrath compare to air pod . I will still suggest my friends to go with air pod', 'I rarely endorse products, but this is virtual perfection. The noise cancellation is so good, I find myself wearing the AirPods without any music playing, just to silence my environment. Also, the charging case is the PERFECT size. Being able to fit in your coin pocket sore shows how well thought out the design is. They only flaw I see is that they don’t always stay in the ear. They should’ve at a hook or tab built in to keep them from falling out while moving around.', 'No longer working, will not pair with Surface or iPhone -- light on front of case will not come on -- I am very careful with my technology and this is unacceptable, 5 months and Amazon Chat, after keeping me in Chat waiting for a response for 15 minutes, and validating/authenticating who I was, stated they could not help -- my IT determined AirPods were defective.  Disappointed Amazon.', 'I used my kids’ AirPods from time to time and wanted my own. These fit much better in my ears and the noise cancellation worked well while I used my power tools. The transparency feature was awesome while driving or having a conversation.', 'My son had the original Airpods and decided he needed the Airpod pro’s after he lost one on the originals. The features of the pros warrant the additional cost. The noise canceling alone is worth the upgrade cost for airline travel. As for cost you get what you pay for and being in the apple ecosystem they just work right out of the box with all of our apple devices.', 'I have tried all of the sizes of nubbins they send and they will not stay in my ears for more than a few seconds. Not even sitting perfectly still at my desk trying to have a conversation on the phone. When I push them back in they hang up on people. These are trash. Expensive, overrated trash. We miss you Steve Jobs.', \"Very good pair of earbuds, It's small and compact enough to put in your pocket when you're not using them. It's very comfortable when wearing thanks to the silicone eartips that apple provides. I do however think the noise canceling is okay for its price point.\", \"I bought these to pair with my Mac pro laptop to use for conference calls.  The sound quality is great and no one has complained about not being to hear me or not.  The battery life works well for what I use them for, as I usually just use one at a time, so I always have a fresh one available.  Used them on a flight from New York to Phoenix, and was able to have them on the noise cancelling mode the entire flight (5.5 hrs), while using them in the airport (transparency mode) before and after the flight.  Yeah, they are expensive and do not expect them to compete with noise canceling prowess of the Bose over the ears headphones.  I've tried multiple cheaper bluetooth earbuds and around then neck wired buds.  These are more convenient for me.\", 'While I like the music quality the reason I use headsets are for phone conversations.  Everyone I talk to while using this headset complains, they say I sound like I am in a tunnel, tin can, or they can hear every noise super loud.  I mostly use my old set of airpods as they are better for the folks on the other end.  Disappointing.', 'The AirPods Pro work as expected.  They give you a chime or tone when it is time to charge them again.  I just wish they had a longer battery life on a single charge.  4.5 hrs is not very long.  I do like the fact that the case will charge them back up to 100% in about 20 to 25 minutes.  To maximize my use time I only wear one pod at a time.  I got these to replace my LG Tone neck band.  I prefer wearing my neck band then having pods in my ear but they stopped making the style I like.', 'The AirPods where fine for the first few months, then it started having some crackling issues, first on the left one the on the right one. After the issue occurred the sound on the bass would get really distorted too. I wouldn’t really recommend them until this issue is fixed since they are very expensive.', 'Christmas gift for my 15 year old daughter. She has an older set of air pods. She says the new air pod pros have a crisp sound and she can hear her hair move!! She is very happy with the quality of these. Only issue is the wire they give you is not compatible to our cubes. The charging wire is useless to us.', 'I’m on my third pair because after a while they develop an annoying amplification of every foot step, head turn, or crunching noise.  The two units that failed were for different reasons, but the effect was the same.  So unfortunate that something that works in the Apple ecosystem fails so regularly for me.  My wife’s pair also eventually failed as well.', 'This pair of AirPods were surprising The noise cancellation isn’t top of the notch but pretty good for wireless earbuds. It last for hours too. The case holds a good amount of charging power when you run out, and it charges them quick too. It also fits easily into my pockets. They give different cushions for ear sizes. The command buttons are nice and respond on time.', 'I have tried a few other pairs that look like AirPods but do not have the quality. I had to return one pair as they kept falling out of my ears, disconnecting and hanging up on calls. I should have just bought the AirPods from the start. They are comfortable in my ears and work correctly and sound amazing. Would highly recommend!', 'So product is great but they neglect to tell you that a regular cube from Apple is unable to charge the pods but they send u a charging cord for the pods just no cube cause that is helpful it would have been nicer at $150 for the pods and cube and cord separate instead of finding out the day they are delivered that there is no cube to charge them very rediculous and unsatisfactory, how can you sell a product that has no means of charging it on arrival?', \"Get them in at the right angle with the right tips and they're the best sound product I've bought. Ever. They aren't reference monitors. They aren't hifi people's dream headphones. These are well made, well engineered, highly convenient, lightweight, ear gripping, comfortable, gems. There aren't volume controls on the actual headphones, but that is the only flaw. Otherwise.... perfect\", 'Great fit and feel on my ear. Does not hurt like the regular ones. Also sound is great with noise canceling option. Used in the bath a few times and water splash or sweat did not damage it.  Battery life last long a plus too! 6 months strong and still works great!', 'I upgraded from the original air pods. Those were good. These are great. I mostly wear them when running and they stay in my ears great. Love that they are sweatproof. Sound quality is better with the pros. I’m keeping my originals at work and take my pros with me.', 'I work from home and use multiple audio inputs depending on the circumstances. These give me great mobility when I want to move around during a call. The noise canceling seems to work quite well. They were a good investment for me and I recommend them.', 'I bought this \"lightly used\" \"very good quality\" product expecting to receive a like-new product.  What I received was a personalized product with the name \"MASTER KIM\" on the case.  That was the least of the problems.  The case had several very large indentations from what appear to be canine bite marks.  Inside the case, were the airpods themselves, each with their own canine bite marks.  The real kicker was the large chunk of earwax that was still attached to the right airpod.  This was an incredible waste of time and resources.  What a complete joke.  Do better Amazon.', 'I previously had a pair of Air Pod Pros that I bought directly from Apple. I loved them but then they got damaged and I had to buy a new pair. Saw these for cheaper on Amazon and they work exactly like my previous Air Pods!', \"These are fantastic and worth every penny. I'm really picky about headphones, earbuds, speakers in general, and if something doesn't sound great then I won't keep it. These are good enough for me to use instead of my audiophile sound nerd Shure SE535 earbuds. That says a lot.\", 'These are totally worth the money. My favorite thing about them is transparency mode. I love being able to listen to music and hear what people are saying to me. The sound quality is incredible and the ear buds fit perfectly in my ear. When I use them as a phone to talk on them, I have no troubles hearing the person talk and they have no troubles hearing me. I love them!', 'Update I changed the size of the tip and so far so good no drops. The sound from these airpods are amazing, they matched up with my iPhone and iPad with ease I love that, I would have given them  5 stars except when I did the ear tip test the tips the app said were the right ones do not fit and they keep falling out of my ears. I’m  very disappointed but that seems to be the only flaw for me.', \"My overall rating for the AirPods Pro is five stars only because Apple products are simply the best personal electronics out there. Actually I'm a huge Apple guy. Currently I have eight apple products being used. However, if anyone interested in purchasing the AirPods Pro has an issue with finger dexterity or tactile sensation, these are not for you. I struggle with that issue, therefore they are very difficult for me to grasp and to insert into my ears. They are quite small and made of very slick material, just as the originals. They were so cumbersome for me to use because I was consistently dropping them while picking them up and dropping them while putting them in my ears, etc. That is the only reason I had to return them. They simply weren't functional for me.  Obviously, if you have none of those concerns, these are absolutely perfect for you.\", 'The reason for the 2 stars is... I bought them for my wife and even with the smallest ear piece they still fall out of her ears. The sound is great the batt life is great and easy to connect to her iPhone. Just won’t stay in. I wish that apple would include different types of ear tips so that everyone could use and enjoy AirPods.', 'Cancels noise well, audio quality excellent, but not best fitting or comfiest buds. They tend to work themselves out of my ears and need to be pushed back into position frequently. Never had that problem with any pair of wired buds. Now that they’re wireless they want to fall out lol. The slightly older, cheaper model might fit more people better. The next generation of buds could also use a gentle physical touch volume control.', \"These sound fantastic but will not stay in my ear. As long as I don't move much I really enjoy them. I am going to hang on to these and hope that Apple will come out with better fittings for these.\", 'I purchased a pair of these and normally Apple is an exceptional product. I feel that it was the product but maybe the seller that was selling defective items. I sent original pair for an exchange due to the left ear making a high pitch noise. They replaced. I got the second pair and the left one didn’t even work. The would not exchange but offered a refund. I sent the item back 2 weeks ago and today got a partial refund of $175. That is shorting me with tax $50. Not good business. I don’t blame Apple. I do blame seller.', \"I bought the original AirPods when this first came out in 2016 for college. When I was packing for graduation, I lost my originals and was debating whether to upgrade to these. I originally bought these from BestBuy and i would recommend just ordering off Amazon. The ones I got from BestBuy were faulty and noise cancellation was not working a day later. These work just fine and I didn't have to waste time commuting to pick them up. On top of which they're $15 cheaper than the apple store. Great job amazon at making these easy to purchase!\", 'Unboxed and honestly horrible quality for the money. Nothing special about them. The worst part is that they just blink for me and will not connect to my phone or any other device. And yes I tried everything anyone else would tell me to do, and nothing works. Also won’t even let me reset the AirPods they just continue blinking white. Obviously going to get them fixed because like everyone else im a sucker for apple. But do yourself a favor for once and just get a different brand headphones', 'The AirPods Pro work great but the product was delivered missing its charging block and cable. I contacted Amazon support and they were only able to send me a replacement product if I exchanged my purchase but weren\\'t able to send me a new cable or block. Their replacement product was also missing these items, disappointingly. I wouldn\\'t recommend buying \"Used Like New\" as it\\'s misleading. You\\'re missing out on a $50 value without the charging accessories.', 'These turned out to be a great pair of AirPods! Everything is working well and functional! I got them for a great price! I’m a satisfied customer and will recommend to others! The price for this was reasonable! The package arrived on time!', \"I really want to like these.  The sound is very good.  I like how minimal they are.  Noise cancellation is meh.  But the real problem is that they don't stay in my ears.  I tried all the different sizes and they fall out constantly.  Maybe my ears aren't normal...not sure.  Will go with the Powerbeats Pro instead since they will for sure stay in my ears no matter what I'm doing.\", 'These sound nearly-or maybe as good as my over the ear Bose NC headphones.  Beautifully packaged.  The set-up consisted of putting them in my ears and my eye phone displayed a lovely rotating image of the Air Pod container and in minutes I was playing music.  I was able to test them later the same day on a bike ride and they felt secure and the noise cancelling worked extremely well even in the wind with traffic noise.  BTW, you can check the fit in settings also. Sound was good for speaking on the phone as well.  I wish the battery life was a couple hours longer-but they recharge quickly.  Great product!', 'In the end they were a big waste of money.  The charging case “burned out” on two separate AirPod Pros that I bought…and both within 6 months.  Apple customer service is terrible as always.', 'The Airpod Pros are terrific.  Initially, I was content with the Airpod 2nd gen model but the Pros are definitely worth the upgrade in my opinion. The noise cancellation feature is a welcomed and easy to use feature and so is the outstanding battery life of the Airpod Pros and the charging case.  These are my new go-to wireless earbuds and they pair so easily with my Apple-friendly household.', 'If you’re nuerodivergent or on the spectrum these headphones are a godsend! I was a Skullcandy user through and through until their wireless headphones came out and they just went downhill in quality. I use headphones daily and was really debating on wether or not to get these. I really struggle with overstimulation and being overwhelmed by my environment and it’s sounds. These headphones last on a single charge almost my entire 8 hour shift! I gave 4 on the noise cancellation because either I’ve gotten use to it or it’s wearing out. I don’t know but I thought I should include that.', \"I like to listen to audiobooks. These are perfect for that. When I'm walking, I just use them as regular airpods. I just took a flight and tried the noise cancelling feature while on the plane. It was fantastic. I definitely recommend these.\", 'Got the \"used - fair condition\" for $150, and have to say I am very impressed.  They came clean, with just light scratching that you would expect.  These for forsure real.  I have bought many fakes, and you can\\'t switch seamlessly through multiple apple devices.  The sound quality is good, along with great noise canceling, but the main draw is the multiple device connectivity.', 'Out of all of the Apple products I have owned these are the worst. The fit is horrible and I’ve had to buy different tips to stop them from falling off my ears and even with the different tips it feels like they will slip out at any minute.  Sorry Apple but these SUCK!', 'I’m going to be quite honest. They really are jot that great. Sometimes it sounds like it is crackling, other times it sounds like it’s skipping in between words. Just not that great for the price. I feel like it was a used product when it should have been brand new.', 'Just got mine. Took 5 minutes to set up, try all functions. Had my wife stand about 5 feet away and talk. I could not hear a word. Turned on transparency heard her fine. Comfortable without having to posh pods in my ears. I’m in heaven, love them and great price.', 'I tested almost all the top notch earbuds released in 2020 and I can say that these AirPods Pro blow em out of the water in all domains (yes , music , and bassy ones too !!!) Only drawback is the battery life , but the (very tiny) charging case is here to help ! 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️', 'I have a sedentary job sitting in front of a computer all day. I am able to listen to music, podcasts, etc and have wired headphones. I tried the AirPods twice (bought and returned both times, second time was to give them a another try). They do not stay in my ears. Even if I’m just sitting there, they work their way out and any slight movement they fall out completely. The sound quality is great, but if you can’t hear it because they fall out of your ears, sound quality doesn’t mean diddly. Also, battery life is short and one side drains faster than the other rendering both useless.', 'I use these pretty much daily at work.  And when I fly, these have been great when you use both.  I use only one side at work usually.  It doesn’t fall out as easily as the original.  I think the noise cancellation works well.  I am happy with the sound and quality.  They are expensive for what they are.  But they are worth it in my opinion if you use them on a near daily basis.', 'Older version AirPods didn’t stay in my ears. We bought 2 of these (one for me, one for wife) and both fit and stay in place. These have better noise cancellation than expected and compare to our Bose over ear NC headphones. The only reason for 4 stars is the price feels a bit high compared to other options.', 'Not a regular USB so not compatible with normal iPhone iPad blocks.

Cheap Apple!', \"Got this for my bf and he says he has a hard time keeping it in his ears... He tried all the ear attachments and couldn't get one that was secure.. We ended up having to buy hooks and memory foam ear attachments and he finally had no problems with it falling out... Other than that, sound quality is great and noice cancellation is excellent\", 'The apple air pods came in a box with 3 size ear pieces and a charging cable for it. You have to figure out what ear size you have to make sure they are the perfect fit. The charging cable is the newest apple cable they have, but they didn’t come wit an adapter for it. So you will have to go buy one to charge it. Working out wit them they feel like they will fall out if you sweat. Both modes are very useful , noice cancellation and transparency mode work like a charm. The buttons to change the music or perform actions could be better or stick wit the regular tap like the old air pods.', 'Purchased as a gift for the husband. He loves them, the transition to the earphones you wear around the neck did not take long. The noise canceling feature is a dream. Only issue is the sensitivity on the touch features. Sometimes when you are pushing the earphone in more you can end the phone call.', \"These are really good earbuds they sound great the connection is amazing. The battery life is also pretty good I used these for a while but I have recently lost them. I'm very sad that I have lost them.  Anyways the noise cancelation is really nice especially if you like to ignore people or if you like to have some peace and quiet when listening to music or other things. They sound way better with the noise cancelation and I couldn't go with out it.\", 'All you need is to use ear pieces that don’t slip out the ear. It can be the best sound in the world but it’s pointless if you can’t hear it because it won’t stay on your ear. Use the type of rubber that won’t slip out. I’ve used some cheap earphones that don’t slip out', 'I bought these primarily for working out and they are perfect at cancelling out the noise of the treadmill. They also manage to stay in my ear even when I’m running. I’ve used them in the car and they also manage to cancel out a surprising amount of the road noise, though I’m not sure how they would do on an airplane. I was also fairly surprised at the noise quality. IMO, they are a step up from pro beats, but a step down from typical over-the-ear headphones like my Sony’s that I own (nothing can beat those Sony’s). But for being a noise cancelling earbud, these do a phenomenal job.', 'I love these lil cuties. I’ve been struggling to find headphones that don’t hurt my ears for years. I tried my partners air pods (originals) and they hurt my ears after 10 seconds! I was SO excited when Apple came out with squishy air pod pros. I can wear these for hours, and the noise cancellation makes studying in a loud cafeteria possible! :-)', 'Expected better battery life, 4 1/2 hours before recharge. They do suppress the sound somewhat, but I would not want them to suppress it all. And their ability to be translucent is definitely a premium where I live. I am very happy with my purchase, and am inquired about them continuously. Leading question is, can you really hear me easily?', \"Could be better with battery life. Easy to use and pair. Like the customizable ear piece sizes. Still feel the smallest ones I use don't keep them in my ear. Have to adjust a lot and sometimes they just fall out. Also I'm not a huge fan of how to play and stop songs and skip them.\", 'Bought these for my wife for Christmas. Didn’t know if she would enjoy them, but they are already getting a ton of use. She’s loving them. The pro is worth the extra money, the main selling point for me was the pressure release that helps with comfort when wearing them for a long period of time', 'I contemplated buying these for months because of the price but I am SO glad I did. They are worth the money and are everything I hoped they would be. I use them the most while I workout and clean the house. They are amazing.

The first time that i toggled the noise cancellation, my mind was absolutely blown. Great for turning on some music, tuning everything else down, and getting work done. The battery life is also fantastic, microphone and sound quality are great. All around a fantastic purchase and I've found that I get more value out of this than I ever expected.\", 'I wasn’t really sure what to expect when ordering these because you see adds for headphones all of the time just to be disappointed by quality. With the Apple air pod pros I can honestly say I was not disappointed. The first thing that shocked me was the noise cancellation. These literally clear out everything and make it so easy to zone out and just vibe with whatever you’re listening to. No joke. The sound doesn’t get extremely loud like I know some people like but it’s perfect because they lock into your ears and cancel other noises so they really compensate in other ways. I would definitely order these again!', \"I really wanted to like this Airpod as I got it much cheaper on black Friday. However, it gets disconnected for no reason often.

Apparently some AirPods Pro have different firmware in each AirPod so they stop connecting and it’s a hassle. They say it’s like a glitch in them.

I can walk my dog around the neighborhood and listen to music while also hearing cars near me. I like being able to know what’s going on around me.', 'I had these AirPods for like 3 months or less and they broke not only that but I actually avoided using Tham because of how uncomfortable they were, when they broke I did not buy AirPods again instead I went for Tozos which not only cost way less, they sound about the same they both have noise cancellation and the Tozos can actually wirelessly charge to, they fit much more comfortably as well too.', 'In my neighborhood we have poor cell quality to the point you had to be touching the window on one foot. No not that bad but the pods allow me to set the phone in an area where I get reception and be able to walk around the house and get things done while catching up with friends and family.', \"The sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing. But they start to die after 1.5hrs of calls, not convenient for business if you're on the phone frequently. Also I found myself often needing to push them pack into my ear, they get loose after talking for a while. For business and travel, I think a wired solution is still best.\", 'I like the noise canceling sound. I upgraded to the pro from regular. I wish I’d kept the regular. These continually fall out of my ears', 'I use these with my Ipod touch, my samsung android phone and a bluetooth dongle attached to my computers. Works great and great sound quality. Noise reduction is really good. Battery life is less when in noise reduction mode. Easy controls on ear piece allows for music pause and easy change between noise canceling on or off. I like they are soft and fit entirely in the ear. Much better than other similar apple products.', \"Saw a renewed pair for cheap. First pair static filled the calls that were made. Second pair, case doesn't charge through port right away and now wirelessly. NOW A NICE PAPER WEIGHT. BUY NEW.....WORTH IT.\", 'Having owned $20 earbuds to AirPod Pros, this is my honest opinion. The sound quality is average. My Enacfire E60’s sound better. In regards to the noise cancelation, the Beats/Bose is better. Where these AirPod Pros shine is the transparency mode. It does work great. Battery life is average. Actually is a little crazy that you have to use either Siri or your device to lower the volume. You can’t just simply touch the earbuds to lower it. My opinion is you’re paying for the Apple brand than the actual features of the product. 3 out of 5 Stars.', 'If you need an in-depth review there are several on YouTube. To sum it up, if you have an Apple phone these pair effortlessly and sound great. The noise cancellation is a new feature for me and I gotta say I’m impressed. It doesn’t block out everything but it makes a huge difference if your mowing the yard, riding in a car/airplane etc.', 'These are solid.  There are very few times they discount but when dealing with Bluetooth anything it can happen. There are times connecting might be an issue but that’s rare.  They fit perfectly in my ears and when on I hear nothing else even if the noise is right next to me.  I’ve heard people say there are delays in sound when watching movies but these are perfect.', 'The sound, noise cancellation and the transparency mode are really good. But sadly I will return these Airpods cause they don’t fit well in my ears. 10 minutes after wearing them causes me pain in my ears, and tried to wear the different sizes and none of them fit. I really wanted to like them but the pain is annoying.', 'I bought this for my wife and her ears are small so it kept popping out of her ear all the time So if your ears are small these AirPods are not for you.  She kept pushing them too much just to stay in her ears which gave her real pain in her left ear that stayed for two weeks and her ears started to ring. The sound was really good and it had noise cancellation that you can barely here anything around you. But sadly it’s not for everyone . We will try the original one now', 'The sound is great.  The active noise cancellation for YOU is good.  However, it does not cancel noise in the background if you are on a conference call or regular call.  The people on the other end hear everything, where as, you may not.  The fit was also a bit disappointing although I could have lived with it.  There was also some really bad feedback at times when one of the pods was not in my ear properly or while I was adjusting it.  VERY uncomfortable noise.', 'Apple actually put a lot of r&r into these.  The pros are definitely worth the extra money to get the transparency and canceling features.  I tried half a dozen different brands with all the attachment options and none fit better than these did straight out of the box.  These are a must have IPhone accessory.', 'Mine came without the cushions you need to actually use the AirPods so i couldn’t even tell you if they work or not Update the right AirPods stopped working after 2 weeks and now the left AirPod has a shortage. The case also will not stay charged', 'I bought these so I wouldn’t have to hear the constant yelling and screaming of kids but I can still hear it. If I’m not listening to music it doesn’t work. I’m only keeping these because it’s got great sound quality.', \"If I could go lower I would.  So far amazon has been fairly trustworthy but this was quite the disappointment.  There was not charger and product came opened even though it said product was new. I will order product elsewhere.  I don't usually write bad reviews as I prefer a positive outlook so this was quite disappointing...\", 'I had bought two cheaper wireless buds in the past.  Both had problems with the sound cutting in and out. No problem with these.  Great for walking or jogging.  Has three different buds for a choice on fit.', 'Well, everything works perfect. I love the ease of pair with the iPhone. You only need to open the AirPods box and accept the pairing. That is all. The 4 stars are due because as every Apple product is overpriced. At least should have bundle package for buy everything at once.', 'Nowhere does it say youre ordering refurbished airpods but thats what arrived.', 'There was no charger. It did not state that the charger was separate.  It was supposed to be a gift. I kept the iPods and bought a charger. That did not cause happiness and I am an Apple user. Do not use my name.', 'I just love love those AirPods pro they are the best, the sound is so great and noise cancellation is so good that you will not hear anything at all and when you activate to transparency mode you will hear everything what is happing around you, those AirPods pro are the Best', 'I absolutely love these headphones, they are fantastic but I got them about five months ago and they are already broken. The left AirPod will not hold a charge, in fact it is draining while in the charging case for some reason. I am absolutely furious because these were not cheap by any means and already having battery malfunctions. Beware that if you buy them you may have a similar issue as I also had the exact same issue with my Gen 1 AirPods as well. They are not built to last, Apple told me themselves when I went into the store to get my original pair fixed.', 'At first I thought I had purchased fake AirPods Pro, but turns out they were the real deal. The noise cancellation didn’t want to work, and for some reason only my left AirPod was charging. Idk why this is an issue, I’ve tried charging the case and everything the right AirPod won’t charge. Disappointed, I’m guessing there is something wrong my with my right AirPod and I was wondering if I can get a replacement', \"The airport pro are really luxurious and amazing! The sound and noise cancellation work great and the earbuds fit comfortable in the ears. I was a little hesitant at first because I thought they were going to be fake but I was wrong' they are real airpods pro!\", 'I watched lots of videos before I bought this one and kind of convinced that it’s good with IPhone. Connection is seamless there is no doubt about it, we don’t even need to connect from Bluetooth, I even tried connecting with windows 10 that’s too work like charm. Sound quality is wonderful and battery life is not so good as I thought, it didn’t even hold the charge for 10 hrs though I used it 2/3 hrs on the first two days. Noise cancellation is something I’m not convinced with as I hear lots of noises though I turned on ANC. I also bought jabra and used in parallel and observed that jabra have lots of customized option than AirPod. So I decided to stick with jabra.', \"I love how great the item actually worked out for my fiancée. I was skeptical about purchasing Apple products on Amazon because I wanted to purchase it from Apple directly. Now, I'm thankful I did. My fiancée enjoyed his birthday gift. The quality in this item is great, the noise cancellation is as advertised and the sound quality is awesome. It tunes out all of the noises in the background and when my fiancée is working out, he appreciates the fact that he can listen to only the music as oppose to the distractions in his surroundings. Thank You Amazon and Amazon sellers.\", 'The left one has gone bad two times now. It goes buzzy and has a loud hummmm on noise cancelling. The first time Apple sent me a replacement. The second time I went to the store and they were out of stock and said come back. But you can’t just walk into the store - need an appt! Ugh. Not getting these again.', 'I had a feeling these would not fit in my ears . I tried all the different size ear buds. They just don’t stay in for me . Worst when I sweat . I gave it a month and now stuck with them . I guess I will try to sell them myself.', \"Best investment.  I bought the regular AirPods when they were on sale, only to have these go on sale a month later.  So happy I also bought these!  If you're on the phone or video for hours, air pods pro won't hurt your ears due to the rubber earbud covers that the regular AirPods don't have.  Also, the Pro buds have noise cancellation which makes listening to music that much clearer and crisper.\", \"Really looked forward to getting these, but once I got them, I notice that they would not stay on my ear. I tried all the ear tips but none really worked, there are some anti slip tips out there, but I don't feel like spending more money on an already expensive product. Sound quality was great and loved the noise canceling feature, no comment on the battery since I never used them long enough to deplete the battery, they just wouldn't stay on my ears. Sad, but returned within a week and I'm going back to my AirPods.\", 'I got these as a gift for Father’s Day. He set them up and was amazed with the noise cancelling since that was the first thing he noticed. They are pretty sleek looking. Everything about these is worth the price though we both questioned about charging. The box came with a charging cord but to plug in to charge the wireless charger, you would need an adapter as it was noted in the little booklet. Without the adapter, you are able to charge the wireless case using the standard Apple charger. Other than the charging mishap, everything seems fine and easy to set up since there is a step by step guide.', 'Loved the product except for a couple things. They would not stay in ears. Good if sitting on couch, but any activity at all and they will fall out. I do NOT like having to push buttons on earpiece. On the originals all you had to do was tap on them. Pros are very awkward. Prefer the originals until they redesign Pro.', 'The sound quality is good in these headphones, and so is the noise canceling. However, they will not stay in my ears for more than thirty seconds at a time. They slip out constantly, which makes it really hard to enjoy listening to music with them at all.', 'I was so excited to upgrade my Airpods ,my husband got some awhile back and I liked his.so for my birthday I ordered one too.Well one AirPod no matter what I did wouldn’t pair.so I decided to send them back .I’ll just buy somewhere else .', 'I am a big fan of Apple AirPods and think these are the best yet! I recently used the noise canceling feature while on a plane and was super happy with the results. I was able to leave my bulky travel headphones at home and enjoy watching movies at a normal volume. This is the best Bluetooth headset I have ever owned.', \"These are my 1st Air pods and let me say...WOW!!!  As soon as i placed them in my ears, I knew they were seriously good.  The noise cancellation shut everything out! Then when the music started I was thoroughly impressed!  They surpassed all my thoughts on how they'd sound. From the lows to the highs, I love them.\", 'Estos audífonos están bien. La conectividad entre el iPhone y el Apple Watch es genial. El sonido es uno de los mejores, pero puede mejorar, sobre todo en los bajos, así como el volumen. La batería dura menos de lo que espere, unas cinco horas. En cuanto a comodidad, debo decir que estos audífonos se van aflojando con el uso pudiendo caer en cualquier momento. Es para estar atento. Y ya probé todas las almohadillas. Los appleliebers sin duda amarán y los más objetivos dirán que están bien, algo caros porque sin duda, pueden mejorar.', 'I bought this for a customer and she returned it back to me in 5 weeks and I am stuck with now. This is the worst Apple product, it doesn’t stay inside ear. First hour or so is okay but then it’ll start popping out of ears. I wouldn’t recommend this insanely expensive Apple product to anyone.', 'Bought me these headphones I can only get one sound play out of only one headphone either left or right but they will not connect together for both sides, I forgot the device restarted my phone and cannot get the headphones to connect for nothing not even on my dads phone so I sent them back I will be buying them from Apple instead', 'I like the sound quality and I really like the noise cancellation. I struggle to use these if I’m trying to talk using them. They seem to fall out too easily. And that’s after trying the three different sizes.', 'Usually Apple is very good with clean and elegant products out of the box. But as soon as I unboxed my pair, I noticed a chip on one of the air pods. I figured that was unusul for Apple…. I then looked deeper into the ear pieces and noticed what looked like some orange ear wax. I had purchased airpod pros back when they first came out, but recently my dog eat my last pair, so I ordered these as an replacement. It just seemed off so I’m returning them. Can’t help but shake the feeling that these were used.', 'Great ear buds that provide noise cancellation and transparency feature . Comes with 3 pairs of inner ear piece so you can create a good seal for noise cancellation . The button has more functionality than the tap in air pods . The only issue I have is that while using it in the gym , I lose some Connectivity , maybe coz there are other people but the AirPods didn’t do that . Also one ear piece sort of slips out while running or jump rope .', 'I have had these for a little over a year and I haven’t had any technical issues yet. The only problem is that they get lost very easily and the find my app is useless when it comes to finding a lost airpod. I have had to replace these about 7 times alternating from the case to the right and left airpod. I just suggest that you be very responsible with keeping track of these otherwise they will be very expensive.', \"The only thing I wish for improvement is price. Getting to the same as normal Airpods would be asking too much, but somewhat in between the current price of Pro and non-Pro would be ideal and customers do not have a different choice so whatever. Sound is neutral, resolution is ok and dynamics is good. Don't own wf-1000xm3 so cant compare. Compared to my wi-1000x, sound quality is a bit worse yet tolerable, but everything else is better. All in All, this is the go-to option for iPhone/iPad/Mac in-ear ANC earphone.\", 'Noise canceling is next level! So worth the price.. easy to sync.. easy to use.. great sound quality. I own Bose wireless ear buds and Sony wireless ear buds.. these work way better for noise cancelling and the extra ear tips are great for those of us with large ears.', 'Awesome headphones with a minimal design, I can’t seem to not love them.(They look better in person). On the other and they aren’t the best for working out, I run 5 miles and they can’t seem to stay in my ear no matter what size adapter I use. But product was great I’ve had no issues so far regarding anything else. The quality is also a big factor in that they are beautiful to look at. I would definitely recommend this product but if the price is to high wait for a sale.', \"These are awesome.  I love them!  The sound is fantastic and the noise cancellation great!  I can't hear someone speaking next to me or to me directly unless I click it off. Two things I am getting used to:  one will slide out of my ear occasionally. I have to double check them after first putting them in. The clicker directions take some getting used to. That’s it!\", 'The airpods constantly fall out even when not working out. I have tried various attachments that came with the pods but  it did not make any difference, I have hurt my ears at times because I am constantly pushing them into my ear so they do not fall out. they have great sound quality and the noise cancelling is great. They are good for regular use but definitely do not buy these if you plan to workout with them as they will fall out constantly, but if you are looking for a good sounding device for regular daily use then they are great.', 'Excellent product in every aspect. I didn’t even realize that there are two battery systems: one battery in the charger case which charges the AirPods Pro in your pocket while on the move, and of course batteries in each pod. On my Apple Watch 5 both system battery levels are shown. The Watch controls the sound system perfectly. Using iPhone 11 Pro Max. My AirPods Pro work well at over 40 feet away from phone inside house. Easy charging by putting the pods inside case on top of approved wireless induction pad.', 'These are so easy to set up and use. As a family we now own three pairs as we keep on borrowing them from each other to try and then not wanting to return them. Yes, there are cheaper options out there but when we have tried them they don’t work as seamlessly and just cause us frustration.', 'I was doubting to buy these AirPods here and not directly in Apple Store, since I’m from Ecuador. But I dared and I don’t regret doing it! Even I got a better price, and they’re new and even sealed AF! Noise cancellation mode is the best thing you want to do if you’re the type of person who likes to get lost in your music and forget about the rest of the world. I’d recommend them more than the recent version of AirPods Max. Practical, fitting, comfortable. The best.', 'First thing I noticed was the sound quality was very basic. Personally I think the earbuds that come with the iPhone has better sound. The noise cancellation is average at best. Not nearly the same quality  as my headphones. Voice calls are clear and crisp and interaction with Siri is excellent. Personally I do not think they are worth $250.', 'Returned!', 'Awesome for conference calls. I do use only one at a time when I’m connecting for work. It allows me to only drain one battery at a time. I did have to get different earbuds so that these wouldn’t fall out of my ears. The foam ones work best.', 'They work great but I didn’t like the silicone tips. They bothered my right ear. Bought new tips from CharJen - AirFoam Pro. They fit great feel nice and soft and stay in my ears with no problem. It made the Noise cancellation EVEN BETTER ! I’m happy with the purchase.', 'These would be great if they were $50, but at $250 they are a terrible value. Just buy a good pair of Sony noise canceling headphones.', 'I love the quality and noise cancellation. My problem is I used the smallest size and they still are a tad too big for my ears. I have regular airports and they fit perfectly. Yes I will continue to use my air pod pros it’s just sad because if I’m not careful they fall out, and because they are too big they won’t fit in my eat perfectly causing the noise cancellation to work minimally. I can normally hear within 3 feet of myself any noise made', 'I am an Apple user from my iPhone 12 Pro Max, MacBook Air M1, iPad and AirPods. Oh I forgot to mention I have two AirPod pros although I have lost all of the actual device’s Because they fall out of your ears I wouldn’t advise it for anyone', 'Absolutely great sound quality. I would definitely recommend you try these ear buds. They did not fit my ears, due to several surgeries as a child, but if they had I would have kept them. I’m returning them and ordering the ear phones instead.', 'So happy I purchased these I have using Beats headphones for over a year since I had a bad experience with the old AirPods that fell out of the ears. These actually stay in my ear and the noise canceling feature is fantastic for tuning out noise. So happy I purchased them', 'They keep falling out of my ears which is really annoying  and I can barely workout  in them since the sweat just makes them even more slippery sometimes the music also cuts off but maybe thats just my WiFi other than that they are pretty good the noise cancellation is amazing and transparency works really well too they feel pretty comfortable in my ears charge super fast too and don’t die as quickly', \"I am really pleased with these buds.  I dropped a star because the tips aren't comfortable for long use - like a long meeting.  I have a pair of Bose (wired) noise cancelling earbuds I have used for hours on long flights and are far more comfortable.  None the less, I use them and am happy to have them.\", 'I like the noise canceling feature along with transparency. However, they did not stay in my ears the way I wanted them to stay. I found myself adjusting them more often than usual and at one point one fell out during my workout from the moisture caused by sweat. I’ve adjusted the earbuds to make sure I had the right fit/size as well. This was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me, however to each their own.', \"Doesn't matter which rubber earpiece I use, these will NOT stay in my ear.  When they are in my ear... the sound is fantastic... the noise cancelling is great.  To fully enjoy AirPod pros, I suggest you get covers that secure them in your ear better.  The covers are cheap and a game changer for this product.\", \"Best ear buds I've ever owned. I really didn't expect these to quiet my mower very much, but I'm impressed. I knew they worked well with everyday noise, but on the mower was surprising. They make mowing much more enjoyable plus I can hear the phone (may not be a plus for some people). Oh, and they sound great too. Definitely recommend these. Not cheap, but worth it.\", 'I love these airpods. The battery life is absolutely astounding. Rarely ever need to charge the case either. Sound is very good. The noise cancellation is also stellar. I had wireless sony airbuds for years and liked them very much but my number 1 gripe was the battery would only last about 90 minutes before needing to recharge. I never got different ones because I assumed that other brands would be the same...... booooooyyy was I wrong!', 'Noise cancelling is outstanding - for earbuds. Obviously it’s better with big over-ear nc headphones. Where these shine is during phone calls - I can be vacuuming and the person on the other line can hear me clearly but can’t hear the vacuum, even if I put my head next to the vacuum.', 'Was hesitant to get these because they cost so much, but soooo worth the price. Sound is great. Love the noise canceling option. I use mine a lot when riding my Harley. Can hear great and with the noise canceling it really drowns out the pipes but when gassing up I can stop noise canceling and easily chat with my biking partner. Game changer for me!', 'The performance of the active noise cancellation is very impressive, to be honest. I have two ANC over-ear headphones from big brands. This in-ear AirPods Pro has a very closed match with my other two headphones regarding the noise cancellation. The most important selling point for me is the portability with this level of ANC. Good purchase, Love it!', 'Pros: Good sound quality Great noise cancellation for the size Transparency mode works surprisingly well pairs easily to apple products long battery life fits well and doesnt feel like it might fall out (for me at least) Cons: Many features lost when using non apple products very expensive Overall I think that the Airpods pro are very high quality headphones that are worth the price to apple users that use headphones daily; other than that i think that they arent worth the price.', 'I tried the original Apple AirPods and now these since September. I have attempted every tip and every single screwball way to keep these things in my ears, but to no avail. Compared to the Bose earplugs, Apple’s are trash. The only think I wish the Bose had, was the ease with which the earphones connected to my devices. Super disappointed. Wish I could still give them back.', 'These are definitely the right choice for you if you have an iPhone. They put out good sound (although I wish they would get a little bit louder), the case will charge the buds and will charge itself wirelessly, and they work seamlessly with the iPhone/Apple family of products. I have used other wireless earbuds in the past that were cheaper and I have to say that these beat them hands down.', 'Everything is 5 stars in sound, quality, but negative 1000 stars in how horrible they design AirPod Pro ...it fall off yr ears even when I change the size of the ear tip...the suction doesn’t stick...and the tab for the pause button works maybe 30% of time...no!!...that’s not going to work me...if I pay this much it better be the best...and it’s not', 'I got these for working out and they fall out!  Believe the reviews that say these things can hurt your ears.  I’ve never had an issue with cheaper wired earbuds popping out of my ears while exercising or causing weird ear pain.  Totally disappointed.  So not worth the money.', 'Good sound quality, and useful for many situations: School, car rides, etc. The noise cancelation is best when near a consistent noise (ex  humming of a car engine, nearby dishwasher, washer/dryer, etc.). For being the size that they are, they’re okay for blocking out voices - wouldn’t recommend these solely for that purpose. I bought mine used, “good condition”. Came with EVERYTHING you’d expect: manuals, cable, ear tips,  user guide, and airpods themselves. The box looked rough when I received the Airpods Pro. But honestly if you’re worried about a scuffed up / dirty (used) box, get a grip; the box doesn’t impact user experience whatsoever - I still recommend getting them used. When I got them they were in good condition: minimal scratches, no dents or heavy wear/tear. They’re still holding up very well! Good price and would  recommend getting a used pair!! The user EXPERIENCE is very good so far!', 'Love it! I have the originals and such a difference! The old ones always fell out of my ears but these do not! Only issue I have is they don’t get loud enough for me. If I’m working (since I work from home with 2 kids), sound is fine but If I’m working out, I like my music a little louder. Probably a good thing though, don’t want to damage my ears but would like them a little louder. Since I do listen to music while I work, I do have to put them on the charger and use the old ones since I listen to music like 7+ hours a day, but don’t take too long to charge. I do hope they work on how long they last for the next generation. Other than that, I really enjoy them and I’m happy I did purchase them.', \"These air pods would not stay in my ears when working out.  I tried all three sizes of pods, and while they would 'kinda' stay in your ears, they felt loose, and often fell out when doing any kind of push ups or sprinting. Since they are so popular, I assume it must be that I have some sort of weird ear hole shape -- so they did not work for me and I returned to using my Bose Sport Wireless -- which fit very snuggly. I am hoping that perhaps the next generation will fix this.\", 'Of course these are great!  And the bass is much much better than the reviews from the experts.  I love a hard pounding bass and these earphones deliver.  Yes, perhaps the Bose $300 earbuds give slightly better bass, but these make the grade and more.', 'I’ve only had these a few days and I’m so obsessed with them. I noticed they were on a good sale and it was so worth it. I’ve been using beats for years and decided to try these. They are so comfortable and last well, I only charged them when I first got them and I’ve been using them non stop. They sound great and I’m so happy with my secession to buy these.', \"Pros: the sound is decent. They're not as good as my Senns, but better than Bose. Transparency mode is a great feature for both running and keeping an ear out for the kids' mischief. Surprisingly, they stay in well and fit better than the wired EarPods that came with my iPhone. BUT (and this is HUGE): I think I was sent a used set. They smell like acetone (think: NAIL POLISH), the charging cable looks like it was dragged across concrete, and the left AirPod's seam isn't flush. I'm completely disappointed - for such an expensive purchase, where the listing shows it as being sold by Amazon, I expected better. I am strongly considering sending them back, because who wants used IEMs? Not me.\", \"Bought my son these airpods pro for christmas. He opened them christmas morning and when he connected them- someone had changed the name of them to - “Find you I'm gonna track you down and kill you's AirPods Pro” I was horrified that this was the message he received on christmas morning.  Upon calling amazon about this issue, they said I could return them, but that there was no replacement available. So the “solution” was after a horrible christmas unwrapping, take the gift away…. So frustrating and disapointing.\", 'Like everything except the mic performance on my Windows machines in Teams/Zoom. Update: With Jabra Bluetooth dongle, I get dvd quality frequency response instead of the default telephony quality. So it’s a Microsoft problem. Updating from 3 to 4 stars (5 would require tips that seal and/or fit better)', 'Thought these would be great but they are ok. The thing that bothers me the most is that they die pretty fast no matter how long I charge them. I like that they came extremely fast, same day I believe it was. Maybe I got some bad ones or something but hella disappointed.', 'Honestly had higher expectations I live all the way in the Caribbean and decided to order these bcz they’re 2 time the cost in my home country but I think I would’ve been better off with buying it here so I could return it... I just got these today at about 1:30 it’s now 8:30 and I’ve charged them twice already the sound quality is honestly not even great the cord air phones sound better to me.', \"Best ear buds I've ever owned. They work great for the gym, jogging or just sitting in the breakroom and not wanting to listen to the snapper heads. Noise cancel does just that. These are worth the money. The case recharges the ear buds.\", 'I do not normally like in ear headphones, but I wanted to try these for the noise cancellation. They are now my go-to headphones! They fit great, there is even a setting to test the fit and find the right size tips. The sound quality is fantastic, better than my over ear headphones! I am very happy with this purchase.', 'So far, the sound quality is great! The active noice cancellation is great, and the pass through setting works great! These setting can be turned off and just use passive noise cancellation. The quality of the construction lives to the Apple brand. So far, no complains.', 'Best earphones I have EVER owned. They are comfortable to wear and the sound is amazing! Earbuds in the past have made my ears sore but not these. Waited and read reviews before I bought them but they are absolutely awesome! No regrets or complaints! If you are on the fence and undecided I would say buy them!', 'I’m extremely happy. I got these used and saved about 25% off the list price. The noise canceling is 10/10 - I am a cosmetology student and these turn the roar of a classroom of driers to a whisper under my music. They also easily and automatically connect to my iPhone. The silicone ear cups are comfy and I have no issues with slipping nor have they fallen out of my ears during hours of use.', 'Excellent for listening to music on your iPhone device. Very good noise suppression. Not quite good enough for airplane use and not as good as the over the ear Bose products. When used on a teleconference it is somewhat problematic it is easier to use the wired earbuds for a much better sound quality on teleconferences.', 'I love the noise cancellation feature and everything else about them except the fit!! None of the air pod covers stay secure during a high intense interval training or any exercises where jumping is involved. Constantly having to catch them before they fall out. I would not recommend buying these unless you are ok with returning them should they not stay in the ear.', 'Noise cancellation & battery life was very impressive. However, I just do not find the AirPod pros to be comfortable in my ear whatsoever. Even with the different sizes it came with! It was very uncomfortable in my ear especially while exercising. I ended up just going back to my regular AirPods and sacrificing sound quality.', 'Only had it for like a week and I’ve been using them everyday it’s great sound quality is great good it has ok bass battery life haven’t noticed to much but most of time I wear them and take them off they lasted quite a while without giving me warnings AirPods are gonna die noise cancellations is pretty good I’ve never used any headphones with noise canceling before to me it’s pretty good', 'I only got it today, so far  it sounded really good, ear tips on it were perfect for my ears, dont know how battery will be the whole day with me, i can charge it in between work i guess, sound is good but could still be better. So far really secured in my ear but im still buying a wire to keep it from falling off my ear and losing it.', \"They worked at 5 star for one week then it became a horrible experience. When paired with my Android I get a skip every minute or so. If I have my phone wifi on the skipping becomes un bearable. If I answer a call from the headphones it will go through were they can only here you then you will only hear them then will connect. Keep the call though cuz when it's over you will need to pull over to re pair. If the phone moves out of range of the case then you will need to re pair. Not just connect but off and on multiple times or a power cycle of the phone. I have done all the internet trouble shooting including factory wipe. No change\", 'I own several brands (LG,Jabra,etc.) and these are by far the most comfortable & stay in the ear the best no matter how much you shake your head. The audio quality is the best as well.', 'Previously had been using the 2nd edition Apple AirPods, wasn’t really convinced that the “pros” were much better ~ well after giving them a whirl I’m definitely convinced!!!  They’re so much more comfortable in your ears thanks to the ear tips, sound quality is insane, stay charged for a good while. Very happy with the purchase.', 'Several issues: 1) I experienced intense itching from the silicone tips. Never had that problem with the old earbuds. 2) Noise cancellation was mediocre and not worth the extra $$  3) Difficulty using the small stem to change modes even though I have small fingers. I will order the regular AirPods without the silicone tips and noise cancellation.', 'Noise cancellation is decent, sound quality could be better, but works seamlessly with phone, computer, tablet, what have you. Battery life is alright. I’d say it’s a little overpriced, but that’s all apple products in general. I’m sure there are better/cheaper products out there but this one ticks all the boxes nevertheless.', 'I love my airpods, the sound quality is good, the range from phone is great, the noise cancellation is not perfect but really god. The only downside is the battery that last only for 4hours and they have to be put in the case to recharge. They adapt well to my ear and I recommend them.', 'They fall out. Like all the time. Even just sitting still', 'I have been using Etymotics wired ear buds for over a decade waiting for the right blue tooth wireless ear buds.  Apple always seems to get it right in next generation.  Now using Comply foam ear tips which are much better than original.  Really happy with them and charging is a breeze.  I cannot find anything to complain about.', 'Had the original air pods before these. If you use an iPhone these are the best option for earbuds. Connect seamlessly, great noise cancelation, and good sound. Definitely pricey. Have been using these daily since May and had very few issues. Even accidently washed them and they still work great.', \"Headphones stopped working after 3 months. Noise cancelation doesn't work, the right earbud disconnects on its own. The headphones are useless. I should've bought them directly from Apple but lesson learned. If you're looking to purchase electronics or headphones do not get them from Amazon!\", 'I had to buy a Q charger because there was not one included in the price . I bought a skin  case with keychain ring . I was afraid they would be easy to lose ...but am loving the skin case . The sound is great and easy to set up with iPhone. They were pricy but the pro have the attachments so they fit firmly in my ear. No slipping out when doing housework', 'I am so glad I found this deal. I have been wanting these for some time but couldn’t afford them.  The sound quality and noise cancellation features are terrific, better than expected.  I haven’t used them long enough to judge the battery life yet. Overall, this is a great item at a great price.', 'Had to return these earbuds although I was very excited to have them the sound was absolutely phenomenal and noise canceling worked perfectly. Sadly Apple made the earbud very big almost bulky and on top of that tips that add to the bulky earbud. I tried all tips and the small and medium slip out of my ear when minor movement. But the large don’t slip out but they hurt if I leave them in after 15min. They should of made the size universal like the AirPod Gen 1 and 2. Terrible earbud design but amazing features I’ll wait to see if the Gen 3 has noise canceling.', 'These connect better than the original airpods but sometimes still have problems. Usually they appear to connect to my iPhone but when I play music it just plays through the iPhones’ s internal speakers. Sadly, I have zero confidence in Apple under Tim Cook to fix anything...', 'This product does not come with a charger. It comes with a cord that looks like a charger but that cord does not plug into a USB port. I can’t put into words how infuriating it was to open this after spending 200 bucks and discover that you have to buy another thing from apple to charge it. Also: I tried using my iPhone cord and while it plugs into the AirPod case, it doesn’t charge it.', 'These are just flat out reliable. I love the easy of pairing them and they connect flawlessly every time. So many minor details that make this product the best headphones. Top notch noise canceling and perfect ambient features.', 'I’m not sure what took me so long to get these. They’re great to go on a run or when taking public transportation thanks to the noise canceling feature. They’re cheaper and fit much better than the Sennheiser momentum 2 and such better sound quality when making phone calls as well. I highly recommend the AirPods Pro!', 'I absolutely love these earbuds and was so surprised at how good they sound and how convenient they are. One of my favorites, i’m just very disappointed as to how my left earbud has been giving me a lot of feedback issues after more than a month of use. It’s made it almost impossible to use as any movement would provoke static to sound from the left earbud and it gets uncomfortable after a while so i’m suck only using the right one. Very hesitant on buying a new pair as they are expensive.', \"I'm glad I got the Air Pods Pro.  They work seamlessly with my iPhone and Mac and the sound quality is awesome.  I like the charging case it comes with.  I had cheaper quality ones, but glad I upgraded to the Air pods pro.\", \"Not sure if these air pods were refurbished or had some kind of damage. And maybe that's why they were affordable to buy. But the sound and quality of it sounds amazing! Highly recommend this product.\", 'these stay in a mans ear really well coming from an older man with ear hairs going everywhere.  i have tried a few different ones and they all seem to work their way out in less than 2 minutes.  these stay in all day and the sound is great.  not quite Bose quality but right there close', 'The AirPods Pro are extremely good earbuds with AMAZING noise cancellation and transparency mode, but the reason I gave them 4 stars is because they always feel like they are going to fall out whenever I’m walking. The AirPods 1st gen fit in my ears perfectly, but for some reason with the pros, whenever I move it feels like they are slowly falling out. Would definitely recommend them though.', 'glad I finally stopped putting off buying these l, because they’re excellent! sound quality is perfect, and the noise cancellation and transparency modes are life changing. the charging case stays charged for many days and i never have a problem losing battery life when i bring these out. love the ease and functionality!', 'The noise cancellation is the real star here. I mean it’s really impressive. They really set themselves apart from other headphones with this feature, which is easily enabled by touching the button on the AirPods (which also feels very cool). They stay in your ear in a variety of positions and come with three size choices for the rubber tip. I personally prefer the smallest size. It’s also worth noting how great the battery life is. In summary, the best pair of earbuds I’ve ever bought.', 'Had to pass along my experience with the Air Pods Pro. Last week I was on the dock and fell head first into the water. (No alcohol involved)  Had to swim to the shore, about 3 min distance. I had my AirPods Pro in my ears, Apple Watch 4, and of course my Iphone Max in my pocket. Got to shore, took out the AirPods and rinsed everything. The watch and phone were fine, but I was sure the AirPods would be toast. Waited about an hour, put them back in my ears and they worked perfectly.  Oh did I mention it was saltwater?', 'Works good K’NEX fast but I’m a little disappointed that these are not more noise canceling because I would really like to have peace and quiet once in a while! I also wish there was a way to set it to where it would not answer every phone call Ding!', '', 'Ok, so my iPhone is USB-C, my MacBook is all USB-C and my iMac is all USB-C so why on earth do I need to still lug lighting cables around just to charge my brand new air pod pros? You know, the air pod pros that were just redesigned for 2020! Very annoying and frustrating. Insult to injury, the cable they provide is a USB-C to lightning just to rub it in I suppose. Come on - give us a break on the cable madness please!', 'So disappointed in the AirPod Pros.  First of all they come with these cheesy rubber ear fittings that are suppose to fit your ear size.  Well, I tried all three sizes(small, medium, and Large).  All three fell out of my ears, and if you want to run or workout.  Forget about it!!  I was constantly pushing them back in my ears or picking them up off the floor.  I have the original AirPods and I never once had them fall out of my ears.  The only positive is the noise canceling!  That works well, but the rest is garbage!  The sound quality isn’t that great!  Save your money!', 'I like the Pros, I will say I think the sound quality compared to other brands in this price point is a bit shallow, the highs bottom out with a bit of a tinny structure. However the bass is smooth and not overblown to make me turn them down. They are super convenient, pair easily, battery holds longer than expected including cross country flights. For conference calls they are a contender, but not as good as hard mic line.', 'The battery life kinda sucks but I mean it works for what I need. The charging case is great and lasts forever but the pods themselves are a little lacking. I love how the work and integration into my iPhone. The fit is great. Just buy them. You’ll love them', 'It was a good thing I bought apple care for these trash pods, after not even 2 years Ive already had to get not only the case and the left headphone replaced. The case stopped charging about 6 months in, and the left headphone died after about 1 year 6 months. Unless you’re willing to risk having to replace something every 6 months, buy apple care, and then still be without airpods for a week when they break, dont buy these.', 'Love these, lost my newly purchased I-pods and bought these soon after, I love the sound quality and the noise canceling is phenomenal. I only wish I could turn them up higher. Probably good that I can’t.', 'I’ve ordered a pair.. then had to order partner, dad, and BFF some... says a lot! They go with me in my pocket like my keys and wallet. If I were 30 mins from home & realized I forgot um,  I would turn around to go back to get them hahaha! Noise cancellation is EVERYTHING!', 'They fit my ears better than regular AirPods. Sound quality is great. Noise canceling is good but not fantastic. Microphone is great and everyone says I sound clear as a bell on the phone even if I’m using just one bud at a time. I extend the battery life by just putting one in an ear at a time unless listening to music in the workshop. Worth the money.', 'Apple swung and missed on these. Sound is great. I love the noise cancellation mode. Design is awful. They just would not stay in my ear throughout a workout regardless of the size tip I used. They were also very uncomfortable. For the price these should wear like a dream but they don’t. I returned them and bought the older version and am very glad I did!', 'It obviously depends on the user. I ended up purchasing a nylon lanyard with silicon grips to keep them attached to me in the event the fall out. Battery life is no long either, so it is necessary to keep the charging base nearby.', 'Bought the Galaxy pro’s which are great but had to get the AirPod pro’s. All things considered, Apple is just easier, fit better, great sound in an easy way. Bought custom tips for the galaxy pros and the sound is great…just can’t move with them and takes time to fit them. AirPod’s pro are plug and play…easy!!!', 'The best AirPods Apple has made. I’ve owned both AirPods gen 1 and gen 2 both in wireless charging and normal type. If you’re an iPhone user, this is very handy and you’ll cherish for having it. I wear it almost 6+ hours daily on weekends and 9+ hours on workdays. The best thing is you won’t feel it’s presence since it’s really comfortable to wear. Like all my Apple goodies I love my AirPods Pro. I’ve only one wish and that’s Apple making it in different color options like space grey and silver.', 'Works great with all of my Apple products. I work at a school and I have 3 young children. When I need to be in a Zoom meeting and my children are home, the noise cancellation feature does a phenomenal job of blocking out the sound. And if I am watching a movie on my iPad, the sound quality is great. I feel as if I am surrounded by movie. When I first experienced this, I asked my partner if they could hear it because the sound wasn’t coming directly into my ears. Definitely worth the extra money over regular iPods.', 'I am so happy that I purchased these Airpods Pro. The noise cancellation feature helps me so much with my daily life. I use these every day and the charging case charges the Airpods really fast! Allowing me to use them throughout the entire day with little breaks for them to charge and to give my ears a break as well. They fit well in my ear and are firmly in place. They have not fallen off my ear yet. The sound is great quality and I love that my iPhone will automatically lower my volume if it is too high for long periods of time. Amazing product! Highly recommended!', \"Sound Quality, battery life and noise cancellation is decent - but not as good as my other head phones. Most importantly my ears started hurting after wearing them for an hour. They are bigger than Gen 1 & 2. Tried all the tips. I don't feel comfortable wearing them. They even fell off couple of time, if you try not to push inside the ear to have a good fit. Painful. My worst buy from Apple so far. Never disappointed by Apple before, but it's not the case this time. Have to use them as back up.\", \"I was so excited to get these and after a day, gave them to my husband. They simply don't fit my ears -- and I couldn't figure out any way to make them work. The quiet is great, but they are definitely made for larger ears!\", 'I own a pair of wireless Bose sound sport. When comparing the apple AirPods Pro to  the Bose, the sound quality of the AirPods is no where near as good as the Bose. However, the battery life, ease of use, noise cancellation feature, and battery life of the apple AirPods are superior to Bose. Overall, the AirPods Pro are a great product and if you have some extra money to spare I would say it’s well worth it.', 'Transparency mode was cool. That’s about it. If the Walmart $20 earphones had this mode the Walmart earphones would be better. The headphones will give you about 3 hours of battery life before you have to recharge and the case last about 48 hours. The sound quality is okay. After about 6 months  I heard a lot of rattling in my ear. Not good! I’m going to call Apple to see about replacing them.', \"I spent $200 to for AirPods, looking for a more integrated Apple solution for Bluetooth ear piece connectivity.  I've used Plantronics with my iPhone for years and it works quite well,  AirPods on the other hand, can maintain connectivity through often a single call.  I see various troubleshooting steps on line, but for $200 I don't feel like I should having to troubleshoot a Bluetooth connection between two Apple devices.  AirPod reliability is exceptionally disappointing.\", 'I’m rating the product here, but unfortunately, I had to go out and purchase it from Apple myself today. When my amazon shipment arrived in an amazon sealed box, I excitedly opened it up. To my surprise, my Apple AirPods had been opened, and not only were the AirPods missing, but so was the case and extra ear buds. Clearly, this was an “inside job”, as the shipping box was untampered with. I’m sure something this small and expensive is simple and very tempting for an amazon employee to pocket before packing up the remains. Otherwise, sound quality is excellent, with deep bass and clear tones. I love the sound cancellation feature and they’re simple to pair. Only complaint is that I had to go through the trouble of requesting a refund and just go out to purchase them myself.', 'I love these AirPods but the only problem is that they don’t fit well in my ears. I’ve used all the sizes provided but ended up having to buy ese hooks for them. They would fall out if I leaned over or smiled. Good headphones but isn’t a one size fits all.', 'My wife bought a pair from apple about a year ago, so I finally decided to get a pair via Amazon. Amazing!!! They are just as good and better in my opinion. Noise cancellation is beyond what I ever expected and has different sized ear pieces to fit yours as needed. Good price too!', \"I absolutely love these. I upgraded from the airpod 2nd gen and i'm obsessed. these are a way better value. The noise cancelling feature is more than i could have asked for. I have sensory issues when i'm out in public and these have helped a ton!\", 'I’m sad. I have duputrins contracture and had to return these AMAZING ear pods as I couldn’t easily remove the pods from the charging case. These are a great must have if you demand awesome sound quality.  I’ve ordered the wired ear plugs instead. Getting old sucks.', 'These have amazing sound quality but they do not stay in my ear there are times when they’ll fall out and I’m doing nothing. I am highly disappointed because I paid way too much for these to constantly fall out of my ear. If these just stayed in my ear I’d love them but they are a constant nuisance and I just had to write this.', 'Love these. I bought them to replace my Powerbeats Pro which I loved, but the case was massive and a little annoying to use. I’ve wanted these for a long time, but I was waiting for a price drop, and $200 is perfect. I love them and I can see myself using them for a few years.', 'Love everything except the fit at times is awkward. For some reason I cannot always put them in where they stay in and work. When I get them in right they are awesome.  I know you aren’t thinking, “you have to think to put in ear buds?”  Right!  That’s why they are 4 stars vs 5.', 'These airpods are great. I love them and the ease of connecting and use. The only bad thing about them is the ear tips. No matter what size I tried, I could not get them to stay in. It was pretty frustrating especially because everything else about the airpods are so great. I ended up buying a third party ear tip replacement from CharJenPro. I got their second edition, and they work great and make the airpods so much better.', 'I was one of those that couldn’t use AirPods (they wouldn’t stay in my ears. I had a hard time overcoming the price at first, but my glad I broke down. I love these. The convenience of the Apple Ecosystem with my watch and iPhone plus how seamlessly they work with my other Bluetooth device. Love these earbuds.', \"I use these airpods every day on my run, and they are fantastic for it. I was concerned that if I sweat heavily they would destroy or damage the airpods pro, but they haven't, and they've actually been fantastic. I don't notice them slipping out unless I sweat pretty heavily that day, and even then it's just a quick push back into my ear. The transparency mode is great for when I want to listen to music or watch something, but I still want to be somewhat aware of my surroundings. The only thing that could be better is the Active Noise Cancelling. I had read somewhere that the ANC was great, but after a firmware update the quality of the noise cancelling had gone down. Not too big of a concern for me though. They also smell like blueberries which I love.\", 'Worked fine for 4 months, though there were some issues connecting to my MacBook (kind of a red flag), and then after 4 months the right earbud crapped out. Don’t have AppleCare so they want me to pay $90 to replace it!! Kind of outrageous for a $250 pair of headphones. Support wasn’t helpful. Apple sucks and I’m ready to quit their whole ecosystem.', 'A significant upgrade that maintains the excellent convenience of Air Pods while adding active noice cancellation. The ANC isn’t groundbreaking but is good enough to help you retain focus at the office or drown out engine sounds while commuting. The improved Bluetooth chip add range and sound quality as well.', 'The product is what I expected and intended it to be for my personal use. There are plenty of reviews out there so I am not going to explain that here. I really love the product and yet to understand the spatial audio feature. Battery life is a major issue for me on this one, but I got it at a sale price, so I can let go of it.', 'I love the noise cancellation! I can’t believe how well it works. Great for everyday use. I do wear them then I workout. If my ears get sweaty they do like to fall out, which is probably my only negative thing about them. Oh and they last a while on one charge.', 'Best present ever! I never thought that I would be able to tolerate having something stuck in my ear canals, but these are a true delight.The ability to listen to music or Ted talks or the news while walking comfortably without having to worry about the wire and phone placement have been wonderful!', 'I absolutely love these. I decided to purchase these as my other air pods kept falling out of my ears and they were a little bit annoying to keep fixing. These fit my ears perfectly and the noise cancelation is amazing. They are just what I was looking for!', \"I purchased to alternate with my apple airpods and didn't use these very much. Couldn't see an improvement in sound quality or noise cancellation. They stopped charging 36 days after purchase and return policy said they needed to be returned within 30 days. I was looking at website today and saw where I had 90 days to return and now it is past 90 days. Someone asked if Amazon airpod pros were really by apple and the answer given was yes. Not sure I believe that, very disappointed. I had purchased a set before that were fake and this feels very much the same.\", \"If you are a student or person who wants to use the airpods with a Chromebook, DON'T! When I paired them and started to listen to music, the right airpods was delayed by like a half a second. Then the music cuts out then comes back up. They even made popping noises once, to solve the problem put them back in the case for 5 mins. But I pair them with my I phone and I pad and they worked, amazingly! No delay! And no cutting out! SO DON'T LISTEN TO THEM ON THE CHROME BOOK! WORKS WITH APPLE THE BEST! But, if you take them up 10,000 ft in the air if you are traveling in a plane. They make this weird sound if you push hard on them. Other than that they worked!\", 'Despite being an Apple product these AirPod Pro earbuds have a fantastic sound quality, delivering an audio experience second only to Samsung Galaxy buds. The in-ear design makes for a secure and comfortable fit and the battery life is exceptionable. All in all, I am very satisfied with my purchase.', \"Simple - I had Bose and couldn't hear squat.  I got these and I can now hear it all or if I don't want to hear it all I put them in active sound cancelation and outside distractions disappear like magic.  Love these buds.\", 'Audio quality of Sony’s are better but these pair easily with the MacBook, so I bought them for my daughter (zoom classes) and she appreciates the noise cancellation.  OK audio quality for the price (I paid $200 a month before Prime Day and then Amazon listed them on sale on Prime Day for $200 - What?!?!).', 'I had the original AirPods and they never fit my ears correctly. They would slip out. These, I love! They fit great. However... every so often, one of the pods, the left usually, doesn’t charge when it’s in the case. Then, when I’m ready to use them, usually on a run, I’m left with just one pod working. Very frustrating! There must be a problem with the connection from the case to the pod, but I can’t see anything wrong. Anyone else have this problem?', 'Our grand-son asked for these for Christmas.  He was so excited when he opened the package; immediately synced them with his technology and we could hardly get him to remove them the rest of the day.  They appear to be very high quality and fit perfectly in his ears--he is 12.', 'The case is uniquely long and the shape of the buds are larger.  The on ear controls are a little difficult to understand initially by touch, but clear after trying several time.  Instructions are vague.  White ear inserts come in different sizes but will soil quickly.', \"The sound quality is phenomenal.  The noise cancellation is very good ... nearly as good as my Bose over-ear headphones.  I wish the battery life were longer ... but otherwise, these are outstanding. I don't have an iPhone, iPad, or iAnythingElse, but these work fine with my Android phone and Windows laptop.\", \"The sound is good. The connect fast and the noise cancelling is nice. My only issue is when i yawn or stretch or anything to scrunch my face they slide out of my ears. I wish they had these in the same shape as the non pro's.\", \"it didn't take long to dislike for the first time an Apple product. the Airpods are just a bad product overall: - short battery life - don't stay in-ear - keep falling I had to buy a plastic fin to make sure they stay in-ear. so bad. disappointed.\", 'Day 1: Airpods pro worked just fine, both had 75% battery out of the package. Light use throughout the day. No major complaints with quality, doesn\\'t sound unusually high quality. Interesting if not gimmicky noise transparency mode. Every single silicon ear somehow was a perfect fit according to Apple\\'s \"check your ear canal\" technology. Day 2: Right earpod suddenly will not power on, Left ear works fine. Spoke with Apple Care support, they could not fix the issue. 3 hours of my life wasted. Waste of money. The quality control is absolutely pathetic - THERE IS NO WAY to troubleshoot your airpods via your iPhone. They are nothing like the apple watch, which has an in-house app. You hold the button on the back of the case for 15 seconds and say a prayer to RNGesus that they re-pair. Hot trash.', 'The AirPods Pro are genuinely worth their price. For all the fuss about “Apple Price tag”, for its features it is competitively priced against Sony’s noise canceling buds and they do it better! Not just noise canceling but in every way. Sony’s is a bit too bulky and not easy enough to slip into your pocket without adding yet another huge bulge your phone and wallet already does. The AirPod pros are slim and only 10% bigger than the OG AirPods. But Apple gives up battery life to be able to be slim but only about 4-5 hours under Sonys. I love these for the gym and they definitely look a lot better than the comically looking AirPods before it was worn into trending status. It’s ease of use and integration makes it compelling to buy it over Sony’s If you have a iphone. Overall great 8/10', 'Nothing beats Apples AirPods Pro, the sound is AMAZING, and the noise cancellation is outstanding. I know the price seems a little ridiculous, but it’s really not for what you get. I’m saying splurge, you won’t be sorry.', 'These are the absolute best, the sound quality is impeccable and the noise cancellation works great. The only thing that needs improvement is the battery life, in my opinion. They last 5 hours. The wireless charging case is very convenient.', 'I wore these about an hour before the pain was too much.  They hurt!  Don’t fit in ear canal well, kept falling out no matter which silicon cup I put on ear piece.  I wanted to love but hated,  terrible battery life compared to other brands', 'They are the original Apple brand. Love them. I bought them on sale for 165 so I jumped on them. I was even able to buy Apple care through Apple themselves. Have no complains they came well packaged and they work and they’re original Apple product', \"I bought these to cancel the background music in my gym along with the voices of other people. They don't completely cancel it but they definitely make a substantial difference.  I'd also prefer to control the volume from the ear piece like I do on other ear phones. not the end of the world though. The frustrating part is they often slip out of my ear. I've tried them with all three rubber ear caps. Apparently this is a common problem.  Apple????\", 'It’s a great product but only one issue the main issue I have. It hurts my ears really bad. Just after few mins of usage my ears are sour from pain. But other features are really good noise cancellation, sound quality, device connection etc. Original AirPods are great fit for my ears but these not so much. So I guess these both are mutually exclusive.', 'I like the because unlike my Bose headset I can carry them anywhere and they fit comfortably in my ears.  The sound quality is not as good as the Bose, but the convenience of being able to carry them anywhere is worth the loss .  The battery does not last as long as I like but they charge up quickly.', \"This is the second iPod Pro I purchased within eight months (I should have learned my lesson the first time). The sound quality out-of-the-box is phenomenal but within a month or so the headset starts to crackle. Sounds like the speakers you blew out of your mom's car as a kid. Starting with the right-hand side. Strangely enough both units were the same condition. Clearly this product is not meant to be used every day. In my opinion you're better off looking for something more durable.\", 'I wear these while doing yardwork, including grass cutting and leaf blowing. ANC works great. I also wear them under my motorcycle helmet and the ANC is almost too good. With the Comply Foam Earbuds, they are more comfortable and never fall out.', \"They sound great and the noise cancellation is good.  It fits in the air nicely and don't feel like they will fall out.  You can get a quick charge if you need it by just putting it in the case for a few min, but I wish the battery life was longer.  I get a few hours max out of them.\", \"Although the battery life is less than others I've tried the Airpod Pros are the only ones I've ever found that actually stay in your ear and you don't have to adjust them every few minutes. Well worth the money for that alone not too mention they sound great\", 'I honestly thought the pros werent worth the price. I am glad that i was proven wring. Excellent sound quality and legit noise cancelling features. Must buy if your an apple user looking for better audio and noise cancelling.', 'These things create an incredible surround sound experience. While watching the mandalorian which had high enough sound fidelity in its output, it literally felt like the sound was coming from a speakers not headphones. Worst part about them is the battery life but they charge rather quick in the case.', 'Doesn’t work with Microsoft Teams in Windows because they are not supported by Microsoft. Not sure if this is Microsoft’s fault or Apple making them difficult to support in Windows. I can hear the other person but they can’t hear me. Microsoft says they have no solution and it has been this way for a long time.', 'The Airpod Pro fit function said they were not fitting properly in my left ear no matter what size bud I used and there was no sound in that ear. My \"refund\" was a gift card instead of a credit back on my card, forcing me to use the money at Amazon.', 'Works great when there’s a good seal but it just kept slipping out eventually even when I wiped my ears bone dry. I tried every size of insert but no change. Ended up returning them and just purchased over the ear noise cancelling.', 'My mother and I tried this for about a week before we realized we did not like these. The noise cancelling feature has this awkward feeling when it is activated, it feels like the air pressure is going inside your ear while feeling like a blockage. It is certainly a strange feeling. However besides this, it has good battery life and ok sound quality.', \"Intuitive. Connects across my iPad and 2 iPhone 7 &12 without having to disconnect one or another from the ear pod like in my previous non apple ear pods. I'm trashing them. Easy to use just like the iPhone and iPad. I would have loved to be able to control the volume from the ear pods though, but not a biggie.\", 'Awesome sound quality, great noise cancellation, great battery life. Everything I could ask for, except for one thing. None of the three sets of pads that come with it fit my ears. And these are far too expensive to risk having them fall out and be lost.', 'These are fantastic! The noise cancellation is so good, even on an airplane. The sound is great and these actually stay in my ears without any issue of them falling out. Great for work outs too! The battery life blows me away on these. Definitely a good buy.', 'Okay, so they are pricey.  With that out of the way....these are a great product.  Sturdy, great sound quality, unbelievable noise cancellation ability and the battery life is incredible.  Was concerned about spending so much on these, but I’m happy I did.  Very impressed.', 'Not going to lie, when the AirPods first came out I thought they were stupid. Later on down the line, I have gotten these and am in love. Sound is great, love that is pauses when you take one out. I have paid for cheaper versions and they always break, these ones are holding up strongly.', 'I have owned other earbuds and nothing compares.  Good price on Amazon and I will never buy another brand after having these.  Noise cancellation is great and so comfortable to wear!  Very happy!!', 'The sound quality is great. The noise canceling is amazing. I wear them when I mow and it almost completely cancels out the mower. The call quality is great too. People tell me they hear me through them fine, like I was talking on the phone. The battery lasts a long time too. I have no complaints. They are expensive but they’re the best ear buds I’ve ever bought. No complaints at all.', \"AirPods Pro should be every bodies dream list. Unfortunately, I noticed it's not perfect at least to me. Noise cancellation can be better. Battery life also can be better. Even walking around the apartment I have  spots where AirPods Pro is stopping work. Would definitely appreciate LONGER distance, battery life, better noise control and ... COMPATIBLE price overall. In general, I'm still satisfy with purchace.\", 'I’ve used these for 3 weeks now. The sound reproduction is good and the noise canceling is great when it works but the fit in your ear is not good at all. After only a few minutes of use while talking or eating they start to loosen up and can fall out on their own. I have to constantly readjust them to prevent this. I actually had to buy some cover hooks for better fit , they work but will not fit in the case to charge with them, so to charge I have to remove the hooks. A very big hassle.', \"I like them they do what they're meant to do and should for $200 but the charging wire doesn't come with a plug so I can't charge them. Guess I'll shove it up my ass?\", \"Purchased these in October 2020 and they worked great at first! Now people are unable to hear me on phones calls that last more than a minute. Super frustrating!!! Especially since they aren't even a year old yet! Purchase them from a different seller so you can get the apple warranty that should come with them!!!\", 'Overall pretty decent earphones! One con is that I seem to be in between ear sizes (medium becomes a little right but small falls out) so I wish they did include more ear tip sizes. Blocks out most noise which is fantastic especially for when working and needing to concentrate. Once gyms open up will definitely see how they last during workouts.', \"When you pay for a high quality product you expect them to work. Within the first few months we had to replace both the right and left airpods due to malfunction, and in 8 months we had to replace the entire set because the microphone wasn't working. This product is not worth it. Buy a set of Bose which allows you to control volume from the headphones and won't break constantly.\", \"Bought these airpod pros April 21 2021, never dropped, never got them wet, always kept them in a protective case, as I do with all my apple products. Just like that the right airpod stops working,(charging). I reset them, unpaired from my phone, made sure I had the latest software and still nothing. When you do a search on the web, that's all you see, right airpod not working. I do recommend buying.\", 'Best earbuds you can get in the market right now as an Apple product user. Smart noise canceling, and clears out the loudest sounds as long as you are actively listening to something. If not, you’ll hear a little background noise, but that makes sense if nothing is being played. I go running with these and they stick in my ears great. Quick connection to your iPhone or whatever other Apple product you pair it with.', 'Fantastic little device, but the inability to get a proper seal in the ear is a major drawback. I ended up getting foam inserts, which improved the fit, but they still feel like they’re on the verge of coming out of my ears. That said, they’re otherwise amazing.', 'Bought this for higher sound quality, longer battery life, and of course for the noise cancellation feature. Noise cancellation does work well but the pods tend to loosen up with jaw movement (talking, eating, drinking) which causes them to lose the noise cancellation seal. They are comfortable and a high quality product otherwise.', 'I love the size and fit. Takes a bit of getting used to. Not liking how they auto connect to my iMac. I like the sharing with another function. Must be careful to avoid them from falling out of your ear. Saved 25% on sale.', 'This airpod is Insanely overpriced but you have to pay the price for the best Apple product syncing.  If you want thing to just work between your iphone, ipad, macbook, then you are forced into buying airpod products. The noise-canceling is good and the fit is comfortable. However, the battery life is short (~6 hours) and is a bad value for this item.', 'Their Apple so you expect quality. You get quality sound and they last about four hours but they really don’t fit that well in the ear no matter which size adapter I tried. I expected a little more but I suppose they’re OK.', 'I love how small they are and how great they fit as well as how well they worked with my iPhone. But the have severe distortion in almost all songs and crackling noise. I got help from Apple with updating to the new firmware which made it even worse and it also made the active noise canceling almost non existent. So I returned them because the replacements they were going to send me will also have the newest firmware which basically takes one of its best features away. I really wanted to like them but they sound the same as my $20 skull candy’s.', 'They sound good, but they have trouble connecting/ staying connected. They don’t stay in your ears very well, no matter what size buds you use. Very expensive for the poor quality. Would recommend you just stick with the first gen air pods.', 'Do not buy the classic AirPods over these to save a little money. The noise cancellation is worth double that price. You will not regret buying the Pros. Use daily, seamless with the iPhone. Incredible and worth every dollar.', 'Amazon sells defective airpods and they did not care me they say your warranty is just one month. One month????? What the helll???? It stop working in 2.5 months!!! Go buy somewhere else not here', 'These are 100% without a doubt genuine Apple Airpods Pro. They keep a charge all day thecase only needs to be charged every other day and the noise cancellation mode is Phenomenal. I work in the manufacturing field and can only hear music while at work... Would buy again', 'Full disclaimer ... these AirPod Pros were a gift to my son, I haven’t used them myself. He has told me several times how much he loves these AirPods, especially the noise cancellation capabilities and the wireless charging. He has not specifically mentioned the battery life. He loves them!', 'This is my second pair. Sound cancellation and quality is just okay. Versatility is great. Durability is okay, my first pair stopped working on one side. If you are going for sound quality and noise cancellation go with UE fits.', 'Great fit for me. I am on the phone most all day. I can leave them in for hours at a time ( basically until they die) and still comfortable. A lot of earphones  start to make your ear sore after a while , Not these !!! I am on phone calls at least 5 hours a day and not a complaint yet from these', 'Great product! Convenience and minimalism at its best! The noise cancellation is mind blowing! it literally beats all the cons about the product. It connects quickly and connects easily to any non-apple device. The sound quality is okayish, I expected a distinctive quality of sound from apple, like we get from Bose or JBL for the price, but was disappointed there. Im using a non apple device not sure if thats the reason. But also on research I found out that other competitors similiar to this in the market have the ear buds penetrating further in which might damage the ear drums in the long run. But apple has taken care not to keep it safe for people to use, which explains the low sound too.', 'The noise cancellation is awesome for blocking out consistent noises like Airplanes, but for voices it’s hard for it to cancel it out since voices aren’t predictable. But otherwise upgrading from 2nd Gen AirPods to Pros. It’s been awesome. Transparency is one of the best features like Noise Cancellation.', \"I have been using AirPod for a few years, and it doesn't work now. So, I decided to buy the Airpod Pro and finally, I got it! I expected that the Noise cancellation is gonna be really great, but I was surprised by the Transparency mode which is insane! I feel like I am not wearing the Airpod, I can hear everything, and I don't even need to take it off all the time. If you wanna get some wireless, I would strongly recommend the Airpod Pro!\", 'If I had to compare it to the older model and this one I would say I like the old one better. It charges faster in the case and I can leave it on longer without my ears being irritated. However I still like this version too. It reads my messages for me and the volume is higher.', 'Came in on time and was a good purchase. No damage. These has functioned well and beyond what i was expecting. I’m glad i bought these because i unfortunately just lost my regular airpods although these are bigger and a bit easier to find. There is only one problem i have noticed and that’s when they drop the airpods seem to fly across the floor which can be difficult to find afterwards. Besides that these are a good investment also keep in mind the sound enhancements only work with both airpods in.', 'Bought for a gift for my wife, as I buy all of her apple products even tho I have all Samsung products lol. But she loved them, she loves noise cancelations features. Loves them better then all other air pod generations. Great buy!', 'I was surprised how well these worked.  Quick recharge by putting back into case for 5-10 min. Only have to recharge case every couple of days with heavy use. Noise cancellation works well. Worth the extra $$ to get the pro version of the air pods', \"While the primary use of these are for music, I found them to also be very useful for gaming. Whenever I don't feel like wearing a headset while gaming, these make a great alternative as they have minimal (not noticeable) lag.\", 'So disappointed that this was not a new set as I had paid for. There was packing tape sealing the box shut. A amazon printed sticker that said New on the tape. These did not have the extra ear tips and WOULD NOT stay synced with my phone. Only positive note is that I was able to return for a refund.', 'If you ever listened to real noise canceling technology, you wil be totally disappointed with these.  Do not buy these, waste of money, the positive reviews must be from people who don’t know how good noise cancellation can be!', 'I have had some ear buds that were okay, but even though these aren’t cheap, you get what you pay for. The noise cancellation is excellent but the sound quality is amazing!  I plan on using these for running in to see how they function but I have no doubt they will be superb!!', 'As anything Apple makes stuff just works and it works flawlessly between devices, pairing super simple and it auto goes to earpiece for convo....great job Apple BUT.....active noise cancellation not the same as Bose quiet comfort. Almost perfect...almost', 'These are pretty great. I came from the Samsung life style and when it comes to sound these are better than the Galaxy Buds. Battery life isnt to bad and they have pretty great noise cancelation.', \"I loved my original airpods and after the mic failed on them I decided to try the pros.  All in all just not for me, I wasn't crazy about the in-ear feeling and the noise cancellation or using in transparency mode.  The sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is cool but when using for phone calls the echo of your own voice in your head was too distracting for me\", \"I figured that since I had an Apple I-Phone that the best way to go would be with an Apple branded set of ear buds. Big mistake. Poor range, battery life is terrible, and don't get me started on trying to receive customer service from Apple. I've had issues with not charging and both ear buds constantly disconnecting and connecting whether I'm on a call or not. Extremely disappointed in this produce.\", \"Man, Apple does know how to make a product. This are great. Pros: Great sound, great noise canceling, awesome battery life, they look good in the ear, they don't fall off and so much more. Cons: NONE. If you can afford it, buy it, trust me you won't be disappointed.\", 'They’re a good pair of headphones. The sound quality at higher volumes start to drop but they still have great quality. The sound cancelation is a great tool, helps around loud noises. The battery is phenomenal, I never really run out or feel like I’m going to. the case is able to give me about a day (or two if I’m conservative) of charge. My ears are small so they do have a slight issue with staying in, a problem a never had with the standard AirPods. I like these a lot but if you are being kinda tight with it the standard ones with the wired charging case are going for about 120 last time I looked, a great choice in my opinion.', 'Best sound source I love them . Definitely worth the purchase ! I love how you can tune the world out and let the sound in as u please . Also comes with different sized ear buds mine fit right out the box ! Charged them up and they lasted all day switching between them .', 'I thought AirPods were for teenagers?! I thought they looked weird in people’s ears. They always look like they’re about to fall out. I just never thought they’d be “my thing,” even though I’m an iPhone/IPad and IMac owner... Wow, was I WRONG!!! I LOVE THESE THINGS!! They fit securely in your ear and sound excellent! I was a little hesitant to be “that guy” wearing them in line at a store, but without the cumbersome wires they’re sleek enough to wear in public. Definitely pricy, but generations ahead (& ABOVE) regular AirPods. Highly recommend!', 'I answered a call while mowing on a zero turn and I could hear the caller clearly. The caller said they could hear me with very little background noise. I had the AirPodsPros in for over three hours with air temperature over 95 deg. They were very comfortable and the fit was very secure.  I have no complaints.', 'Many aspects of the Pro version AirPods have a better quality to them. The design of the case and Buds themselves are improved, with the AirPods having a rubber tip to customize, which fits snug inside the ear, versus the original AirPods which did not. Battery life is about the same, the pros last for close to 5 hours on a full charge in normal mode. In noise canceling they last about 4-4.5 hours. These are the ones you want to get if you have never had AirPods before', 'These earbuds are very comfortable when I get them in the right ears. They block out much noise weather I’m listening to music, books on tape, or just shutting out the ambient noise.  The controls on them are EZ to use also.', \"I bought these as a birthday present for my wife. When using the airpods pro I have to ask her to remove them so I can understand what she is saying, My son has a pair also and he is experiencing the same problem, people can't clearly understand when he talks. Apple has a big problem with the Airpods pro.\", 'I love how the music sounds and the noise cancelling but, it dies too quick! It was on charge all night and the right ear one died within 2 minutes of it being charged at 100%.', \"The noise cancelling on these is PHENOMENAL. The sound quality is great and the fit is ideal. Apple really did a good thing with the AirPods Pro. I only wish that I had an iPhone so that firmware updates weren't a pain and so I could enjoy Spacial Audio. Well worth the price, especially since I bought them for $50 off!\", 'I bought these as a gift for my husband, he is thoroughly impressed with AirPod Pros. As a musician that used to wearing in ear monitors, these provide high quality sound, battery life and noise cancellation.', \"I'm glad I invested in these, because they are extremely convenient for someone who likes to listen to music during work. They tend to slip out fairly easy, though. When I first started wearing them, my ears hurt a lot because the fit was wonky, but they're fine now.\", \"I Always wanted a pair of noise cancelling headphones that I was willing to drop some money on. Bought these because I am an apple fan. Everything about these earbuds is great! Good sound, convenient, and noise cancelling is great. EXCEPT... doesn't fit too well in the ear. I tested each earbud size and medium worked the best. But I was on a run and the airpod got sweaty and dropped out of my left ear. Now less than a week of having them, my left airpod is scuffed up from the pavement. Thought i needed to go down a size but that definitely doesn't feel natural in my ear. They didn't break, fortunately! But very frustrating that it has happened, particularly because I got these solely for jogging.\", \"When I first bought these, they were great. Now they both have popping sounds, people can't hear me on the phone, I can't hear them, and I can't get them to stay connected through a call. My old AirPods work better (gen 1.) Apple will replace one AirPod, not both, or the case and AirPods as I would expect. HORRIBLE SERVICE FOR A HORRIBLE PRODUCT\", 'Unreal quality just wish they were able to fit my ears. I tried my best to fit them with the different tips but they just didn’t work out for me. Disappointed as I really enjoyed the ANC along with the shorter stems.', 'I was so disappointed that these didn’t work for me. They did not stay in my ears and are much larger than corded earphones that come standard with iPhones. They hurt my ears after 5 minutes and constantly feel out.  The setup was incredibly fast and easy.  The charge lasted a long time. The sound quality was good.  But they just didn’t work for me and sadly will be returned.', 'For the black friday price I got these at, I would argue nothing can really come close to the quality and sound quality. Noise cancellation works pretty darn well, transparency works flawlessly to allow you to monitor your environment and you have the option to turn both features off and use as normal headphones. Charging case holds 2-3 charges I think and with latest iOS and MacOS Big Sur (Which is garbage) the airpods sync to whichever is playing music/audio content. Would buy again but expect these to last 1-2 years.', 'The sound is good and the noise cancellation is even better. Battery life could be a bit longer as I’d like to be able to have them in while I’m working 9 to 12 hours. ***EDIT*** After submitting my initial review, I realized there’s an issue with the right ear bud. I’d take the AirPods off of the charger and soon realize that the right ear bud is at 1%, it’s basically not charging at all…. Not at all pleased considering the amount paid', 'I kept looking at other cheaper earbuds to buy and kept putting off getting these. I wish I bought them sooner. Super comfy, amazing sound and noise cancellation, incredibly easy pairing with iPhone. Get them. Get them now.', 'I buy this expensive AirPods, great sound quality but terrible that it falls every time no matter what I do. I buy several attachments to give it a try because I like the sound but no attachment is worth it it still falls from the ear. Frustrated with this expensive purchase.', 'I love my new AirPods! I’m thankful that you can change the tips for smaller ears. That had always been a problem until now. I find myself using my pods a lot more than I ever used earbuds. Easy to use & easy to keep clean. The charge holds amazingly well. I like that I can wear only one pod, if I choose, & swap out, if needed. I find that helps keep me in tune with my surroundings but also allows me the privacy of what I’m listening to or watching without disturbing others. Best money I’ve spent in a long time!', 'Noise cancelling wasn’t working so I took them into the Apple Store and they confirmed these were FAKE AIRPODS. They refused service (of course) and suggested I contact Amazon for a refund, but said they were the most convincing knockoffs they’ve ever seen. For this price you may as well go directly through Apple to purchase the real things.', 'Okay. I can’t find a good fit even with 3 choices. Medium size leaks sound according to fit test and large ones hurt my ears. Amazon listed this renewed product as “like new”and they arrived dirty. Yuck!  Alcohol’d the heck out of them and bought new tips.', 'I honestly didn’t know what to expect when I purchased these AirPods Pro. I have the regular airpods and I wasn’t sure how they were different. WOW. I can’t believe how awesome these are. When I first put them in I had a fan on in my room. When I put the second AirPod in my ear everything was COMPLETELY silent. It was amazingly cool. The noise cancellation was awesome. And that feature can be turned off- but why would you want too?! The quality of these is well worth the money. 10/10. I also like the silicon on them which is really comfortable and also allows the AirPods to stay in your ears- great for working out or falling asleep to music. The battery life is also very good!', 'Do NOT buy these. I have been fighting extreme ear infections, drainage and now crusting in my ears for the last 8 months since I bought these. There is 70 Pages of comments on Apple complaining of exactly the same issues as mine. I could not figure it out till lately.', 'Opened the package only to find a used pair of AirPods with only one AirPod inside. Looks as if someone repackaged and returned their old pair. Probably a one off, but super upset. Will be buying directly from Apple next time', 'The sound quality and noise cancellation is good. But the problem is the battery case and the Bluetooth connection. For the battery case, there is a very bad design flaw that the right ear often is not charged if you do not push it hard into the case even it has the magnet. So you need to check every time to see if it is charged and this eliminates all the benefit it provides. For the Bluetooth connection, if it connects to a Mac, the connection is loss once a day which is worse than any cheep Bluetooth earbuds that only cost few bucks. From the above two major flaws, I recommend not to buy this product. For that price, Bose is a better choice.', 'I have original air pods and love them. I tried these and the noise canceling is cool, but even with three different size fittings they would slip out of my ear while I work out or run.', 'You don’t realize how much background noise you’re exposed to until you pop in these bad boys and everything fades to nothingness. Annoying gf/bf? Gone. Fan blowing on level 3 because it’s August in Texas? Can’t hear it. Only crystal clear music. Pair these with a middle finger at work for 100% less stress… 50% of the time. Is Karen talking smack because she thinks you can’t hear her? Switch to transparent mode and gather dirt in stealth mode. 10/10 would highly recommend', 'So much better than 1/2nd gen. The way the design is no more of the “one side is out and not working” complaints. You had to constantly maintain and clean the originals due to ear wax build up on the black mesh screen (not easy you need small course horse hair brush, alcohol wipes, small pic). The new style eliminates that issue', 'I am  completely disappointed in this buds, they are a pain to connect from one phone to iapd/mac, and constantly I am having to reset them to get them to work again. the actual sound quality and noise cancelling is good, but o man is it frustrating to switch devices or simply connect them to my phone in a hurry when a call is coming in', 'They work but I cannot get them to stay in my ears during any kind of activity. Tried all the different ear pieces. Also the integration with the iPhone is not great. I always get a notice they are connected, sometimes every few minutes, when they have been connected for a while. Noise canceling is superb especially on a plane. Sound is good. The other issues have me looking for something else.', 'Did everything I could to keep pods from falling out. Bought the foam ear end which helped, but the it wouldn’t charge. After watching videos on both keeping ears and fixing charging issues I gave up and returned. BIG disappointment in this Apple product. Seems like they put more into their box packaging than the overall product. Too much $$ to put up with and risk losing ear pod.', 'The left ear stopped working after 45 days. I requested a repair through amazon and was referred to apple. An apple representative told me they were going to send me a replacement and after an hour said that their policy had changed and then hung up on me.', 'Noise cancellation is wow!  May take these on a plane with me, they’re that good.  The sound is better of course, and I just use a charging pad for them.  The battery lasts longer and they come with 3 sizes of extra ear tips to get a custom fit.  There’s even a “fit” program so you’ll know which is correct for you.  Just a great overall product.', \"Absolutely love these headphones! I much prefer using Bluetooth headphones as it allows me to listen to webinars and podcasts when I am at work. I can simply take the headphones out as needed and I don't have to carry my phone with me. I love the feature where it pauses whatever is playing when you take the headphone out of your ear.\", 'No matter which of the three sizes of tips I use with my Airpods Pro, they will NOT stay in my ears.  They constantly fall out at very inconvenient times.  Not very happy.  Apple should have come up with a better design.  As a result, I am being forced to buy aftermarket foam tip or ear hooks as I am now out of the return period.', 'My kids bought me these for Mother’s Day. I walk a lot on the local trails and my son thought these would be best because of the transparency mode. I can still hear my music, but also hear things around me. I also really like the different size ear buds that come with the air pods. I highly recommend the Apple AirPod Pro.', \"Let's just say I start to panic when I pat my pocket and these aren't in there. I don't know how I lived without these. Noise cancellation works incredibly well, sound quality is awesome and I can really multi-task around the house while talking on the phone.\", \"I can not recommend these headphones enough, the bliss and quiet achieved with the noise cancellation is amazing. Please make sure you set up the decibel level limit on your (I assume) iPhone so that you are saving your ears. The transparency mode makes it easy to stay aware of your surroundings and have a very natural conversation with someone while your airpods are still in. Get them, you'll thank me.\", 'The sound quality was alright and the noise canceling did the trick but unfortunately the fit was not quite right for me. I tried all of the tips for quite some time and no matter what it would not stay in my ear well, I would have to keep adjusting it. Hopefully the other AirPods work better.', \"I loved almost everything about them. The noise cancellation was excellent. The music sounded great. I liked the feature that allows you to hear external sounds a bit amplified. The problem? Somewhat bizarrely, it wouldn't stay connected to my phone outside. And when it was connected, it would make strange crackling sounds- ONLY outside. Inside, perfect all around. I heard somewhere that some have problems with airpods pro in loud environments, so maybe that's what it is. (I live in NYC) I returned them for another pair of headphones and this problem went away.\", 'The chargeable case is sleek and the magnetic seating of the buds in the case is very clever. However if you drop the case, and you will eventually, the top is guaranteed to pop open and the buds will shoot out with seemingly explosive force, scattering as far a physics will allow. This is a fixable problem, Apple. Fix it!', 'I am extremely unhappy with my purchase as I believe my airpods are faulty. I only used the airpods once, as the earphones continue to fall out of my ears. Apple staff advised that occasionally the airpod pros have design faults where the ear plugs vary in size. I am disappointed with my purchase and would like to return my item. I understand the return window closed on July 6, however I have been a true customer with Amazon and was only notified by Apple staff recently, which recommended I return the item due to design quality. Please accept this review as an exception.', 'The noise cancellation feature is very cool and works great. My issue is finding the right fit. The pods start to fall out of my ear after 30-60 minutes of use, and I need to keep pushing them in my ear. Then, when pushing into my ear, I accidentally hit the side button. Cool product, but I regret purchasing and wish I had got another pair of basic pods after mine stopped working.', 'I want to like these. The only problem is I have a lot of piercings in my ears (daith, tragus, rook, conch). They won’t stay in my ears! 😩 the sound quality and noise cancellation are what they claim for sure.', \"I'm a huge Apple fan, but I just can't get over how annoying these things are. No matter what I do, I have to adjust them every couple minutes or they will fall out. I've tried all three tip sizes, I try twisting/locking them, nothing helps. I can run and/or talk on my regular AirPods and never have this problem, doesn't make sense to me. Unfortunately I've kept them longer than the return limit, so I will keep trying to find a solution.\", 'I can’t believe I waited this long -  The effortless sync with my iPhone puts my past earbud experience to shame and the sound quality is exceptional. I still go to my old earbuds for fitness-related purposes but that just because these are so dang petty.', \"These look neat but they also tend to fall out of my ears and run out of battery really fast - in about 3 hours. I paid $280 two months ago and for that price these are rather pathetic. I had friends rave about these and then the air pods arrived and I found that their noise cancelling capability is just so-so. The package didn't even include a plug into the wall to charge, just another lonely USB-C cable. Based on my mediocre experience with these headphones, I do not recommend them. You can get better for less.\", 'Packed with features. I\\'ve been surprised how much I enjoy the \"transparency mode\" for driving in the car or when I am listening to music but still want to hear ambient sounds around me. The noise cancellation works great when i need to focus at work and the kids are noisy in the background. Worth every dollar.', 'I can’t believe how painful these are. I absolutely loved the original AirPod the first was great. These have great noise canceling feature but the pain is just unbearable. Maybe my ear holes are too small even though I 6’2” I’m not sure. All I can compare is that episode of Friends when Monica buys expensive shoes that hurt. When she tries to put the shoe back on she’s cringing in pain.', \"Won't stay in my ears as well as my Bose headphones.

Its a very clear difference. They do last awhile, and hardly feel like they're there. I'll probably update this review when I connect it to my Google Pixel 4 XL, I only paired it with my iPad and it works wonderfully with that.\", 'These are mighty for their size. Sound is good.

The transparency mode and surround sound features are especially cool. Easily one of apple’s best products.', 'Best ear phones ever. I also wear them to sleep cause of the noise cancellation. I don’t hear the two kids running anymore on the floor above(night shifter here). After losing lots of sleep before, I’m sleeping like a baby. Also cancels out all noises at the gym. Sound quality GREAT.', \"What more can I say they are the real deal don't buy anywhere else besides the Apple store. Make sure to keep your Airpods case charged at all times the battery's don't last very long but they are worth every single penny.\", 'Delightfully adequate for what I want them to do: allow me to listen on the go wirelessly. The noise cancellation is scary good - seriously, watch your back wearing them! Audio quality is just fine, but nothing remarkable. Set up is ridiculously easy. My only issue is the earphones get really uncomfortable after just an hour of listening or so. I’m willing to put up with it. In short, Apple has succeeded again in creating an easy-to-use, good enough product. And that isn’t a slight!', 'These were bought as a gift for our adult  daughter who works from home. The noise cancelling feature worked well on her recent flight, too. The sound quality was much better than any other ears buds she had tried. She loves then', 'I have had these for about a year now and they are amazing. I wear them almost all day at work to listen to music and pod casts. They are also more clear to hear and speak when using for phone calls. Turn on the noise canceling and the world around you disappears and you become immersed in the audio.', 'Love the sound quality and ease of use but no matter what size ear fitting I use they won’t stay in my ear :(', 'Absolutely awful. Uncomfortable, overly complicated (for no reason), features you don’t need and no explanation how those features “work”, horrible connectivity etc The worst part is how they feel in your ears! A total downgrade, stick with regular Airpods. Returned ASAP.', 'Many times, I’ve replaced the ear buds in their case for charging and only one ear bud has charged. Extremely frustrating. Apple has been resting on the laurels of Steve Jobs too long. This product is JUNK. After a year of use, one of the air pods no longer charges or connects despite having factory resetting the case and extensive cleaning. What a waste of my money. Save your cash and get better, cheaper ear buds somewhere else. I am extremely disappointed in this product.', 'Apple is doing great on its ecosystem which is the main reason I bought Airpords pro. However, comparing the sound quality to other top-tier brands, the sound is just so so. The noise cancellation is a good strength compared to others but overall it can be btter.', 'I’m in love with these! Being able to seamlessly switch between my Apple Watch, iPad, and iPhone without having to connect and disconnect them is also a huge bonus. I was hesitant buying these after having to get rid of my regular AirPods due to them not fitting in my ears, but the changeable tips make for a much more snug fit. I do wish this would be a feature added to the cheaper non pro models tho, as the battery life for the pros isn’t as good, but they get charged super fast with the case so it’s not too bad!', 'I’ve gone through two sets of these AirPods and they stop pairing properly, stop charging. After following all of the problem solving routines they work for a few hours and then one bud does not work. These are expensive and I’m over this-if you buy through Amazon you can get a refund-that’s a good thing. But until Apple fixes this I recommend trying something else.', \"Wasn't sure about these since I have the regular Airpods.  The AirPods are always good, but these are like being in the concert hall.  The phone quality is excellent!  And such ease of use.  Just watch a video and you know how to do everything with them.  Just lay them on a charging pad to charge - no more messy wires!  Great Job Apple!\", 'My wife and I bought these air pods and we went to the apple website and entered in the serial number. It checked out on our phones when we connected them as well. Also having only bought cheap headphones before, these are incredible compared to other headphones. The noise cancelation is un-real.', 'These do not stay in my ears, I’ve even changed the bud size to small. They just fall out randomly, even when I’m sitting still? The noise cancellation is cool, but it doesn’t cancel out stuff they are constantly falling out. The sound quality is good. Also i work construction, and i keep my case in my pocket dirt will get inside the case even if it’s closed.', 'The sound is fantastic with the AirPods Pro. My only wish is that they fit better in my ear. I did put in the smallest setting for my ears. I did not try the larger ones but I have a hard time keeping earbuds that stick  inside of my ear to stay.', 'The most important thing for me regarding headphones is sound quality. I have a $50 pair earbuds that sound so much better than these $200 earbuds. They don’t feel super great in my ears either.', 'It\\'s a good investment if you\\'re trying to cancel out your surrounding noise while studying. Although it doesn\\'t completely mute the noise around you, it does lower the noise. I have small ears so they are a little uncomfortable to wear for more than 2 hours because the \"wing-like design\" kept on pressing my outer ear. The other thing is, the sound is not smooth. It kept on cutting up. I called Apple and apparently the version I had was not updated so they did update the version over the phone. The sound is still cutting up and doesn\\'t sound smooth, but maybe that\\'s just my Airpod Pros. Overall, it depends on what you need it for. I bought the pros for studying purposes and I think they\\'re worth it, but get APPLE CARE just in case.', 'I recieved my AirPods yesterday and I hear static and my AirPods start and stop playing completely on their own. The Apple worker who is spoke to via Messaging was completely unhelpful and did not resolve my issue.', 'I used cheap ear buds for a long time and finally bought these. 100% improvement. The comfort in the ear is good and the flawless bluetooth connection is great. I would highly recommend these and will be buying another set for my wife.', 'The right earbud rubber piece, wont stay attached to the airpod anymore. So I have to tweeze it out of my ear every time I take out the airpods. Now the right airpod completely stopped working, yet I’ve never dropped them or anything!', 'I use these for work as I work in retail performing audits. The noise cancellation dramatically drowns out the loudness of the stores I visit. My only gripes are they are very easy to lose since they are small and the noise canceling could be a bit better. Battery life is perfect for what I use them for.', \"I was not sure I was going to be impressed with the noise cancellation from earbuds. I'm a big fan of the Bose noise-canceling products and didn't think Apple could do it as good in such a small package. Wrong. Great sound. Good noice cancelling. Very easy connection and use to Apple devices. Battery life could be a bit better, but there is a lot going on in those tiny earbuds.\", 'Falls out of ear very easily, had to buy aftermarket product’s to keep buds in my ear. Battery life is horrible. I also have issue with Bluetooth control. I have multiple devices and it keeps switching almost like it knows what will annoy me the most.', 'These have great sound quality, good sound cancellation, but horrible fit, worst design possible. They fall off so often than I went to use the restroom, flushed, and as I was walking away the headphone fell in the toilet and got flushed. Terrible fit for running, gym, hikes, but amazing for listening to anything while you sit and not move. What’s the point of you can’t move. Great sounds terrible fit.', 'My wife bought me a pair for Father’s Day, and I had to turn around and buy her some so she could enjoy them as well! The sound quality is unbelievable. I use them intermittently during the day, but can easily go 3 days without charging them. I don’t know how I survived without them!', 'I am constantly on the phone for 4 to 5 hour straight. The battery life can not last for more than 4 hours. The Noise cancellation works very well, so I wear one ear at a time to make sure the other one is charging and will be ready when the wearing one is low on battery.', 'The battery life of the right headphone was horrible it died three times faster than the left and they stopped working/pairing after literally one exact week of receiving them. Amazon contacted Apple support for me to send them back but still disappointed that I have had to call and return after one week.', \"I got these to replace my aging 1st gen AirPods but I didn't quite expect to love these as much as I do! I use these all day from listening to music and partaking in conference calls. I knew I'd love the Noise Cancellation, because who doesn't love an immersive experience, but I wasn't expecting to enjoy Transparency so much. The ability to listen to your content or phone call while still being present in the world around you is so underrated and is absolutely essential for any future headphones I purchase. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for new headphones or might not be sure about upgrading from your old AirPods!\", 'These hurt my small ears - paradoxically, using the largest of the three silicone inserts that come with them helped the most! Noise cancelation is obviously not like over-ear headphones but is pretty good - like turning the TV halfway down.', 'Even with 3 different cups for size, they will constantly feel like they are falling out. If you’re lucky, they will connect like normal and won’t be buggy at all. If you’re me, they are buggy as hell. Long hold for Siri? No problem. You’ll hear the click, but Siri won’t hear a thing through either the headphone or microphone on your iPhone. You like ear infections? Great. Common problems include irritation from the silicone, which in the first week gave me an outer ear infection. Save your money, get regular AirPods or any other Bluetooth headphones. They will work just as well, without all the hiccups.', 'I really wanted to keep these. They are great headphones if you don’t workout/exercise intense. I’ve tried every size ear tip and they both go flying out everytime I’m on the heavy bag. Guess I’ll stick with my gen 2 AirPods. Let alone I haven’t been refunded in over 3 weeks. So that’s cool too.', 'I have owned different ear buds from a variety of companies.  None of them had the sound quality and fit of these.  The ability to modify the fit of the earbuds to your ear makes sure they will not be falling out.  Totally enjoy them.', '1. better fit - Never fell of my eara 2. Better size - smaller than the two previous ones 3. Better sound quality 4. Much better bluetooth connectivity 5. Noise isolation works well because of the earbid silicone tips Is it worth the upgrade? Yeah, to me is is so worth it', 'If you’re always traveling in a plane with a super loud engine, YOU NEED THIS! If you have annoying parents, friends, or coworkers who always try to argue with you with nonsense, YOU NEED THIS! If you want a deep focus or intentionally wanna ignore someone YOU NEED THIS!

I HAVE HAD THEM IN MY EARS FOR A TOTAL OF 12 HOURS SO FAR. I HAVE \"NOT\" EXPERIENCED ANY EAR DISCOMFORT WHAT SO EVER. IN FACT, THESE PODS ARE SO COMFORTABLE, I HAD FORGOTTEN I WAS WEARING THEM.', 'This is my third pair of AirPods Pro. The first set I bought when they were first sold lasted 1 year before they began losing sound quality. The left ear pod had a bad fuzz. Bought a second pair from amazon and after 1 week the left ear started to make an odd fuzz noise! So I returned them and got these as a replacement. So far so good! Overall dissatisfied with the quality of the apple product.', 'A little too bulky to be comfortable even trying the different size of the adaptors. Falling a lot more than the original design. After few months the left mic quality is dropping. Very disappointed after being a long time usage of the previous generations.', 'Love my new AirPod pros! Sound quality is fantastic! I recommend turning off the ear detect if you use the smaller ear pads. The ear detect doesn’t work as well with a smaller pads. Cuts on and off. Otherwise they are fantastic! These are my first pair and I wish I had bought them a long time ago.', '4 months into use...not daily use either...and the AirPods have stopped working. Well, for accuracy sake...they still attempt to connect (one at a time) and they do transmit sound (the one that happens to be working in that moment that is) but after a few seconds the single working pod cuts out. On a positive note, it will come back on within 60 seconds usually so that the user can enjoy another 10 second burst of music, or a podcast, etc. Far too expensive to have this result. After contacting Apple directly about this issue, it has been 10 days (give or take) without response.', 'These are a very nice pair of headphones but if your looking for a workout pair these aren’t it the buds and water will jus cause the airpod to fall out but if your looking for an everyday use these are perfect noice canceling is very nice to have but these aren’t the best I’ve heard in a pair of headphones but they do the job', \"I like these much better than the prior generation Air Pods I had.  In the first generation, I got a weird pain, from what felt like the electric, bluetooth signal.  I don't have that issue with the Air Pods Pro.  Sound it great, and they are more comfortable.  I do miss the easier tap features of the regular Air Pods, but have gotten used to it.\", 'Website says \"AirPods Pro with MagSafe Charging Case\" under Technical Details however these are NOT the MagSafe version.  Returning', 'I love this product. Apple knows how to make us buy things and then later need them everyday. I think the sound quality is amazing and I love the noise cancelling feature for when I am traveling or i just want privacy in my room. I recommended this product to all my friends and they are happy with it.', 'I experienced a hiccup in my order and it was corrected immediately. I am beyond impressed with these AirPods. The noise cancel setting is amazing. I got them to use for when I go into labor any minute. I can’t take the epidural because I am allergic. The next best thing would be to listen to music to take my mind off of contractions. Definitely worth it!!', 'Worse than the first or send gen AirPods. The sound is garbage, the battery life is awful and the pain they create in the ear is annoying. Overall just stick with the classic AirPods cause these are over priced garbage.', \"Not sure if it's because they were purchased from Amazon and not Apple, but the displayed charge in each AirPod seems to fluctuate wildly in accuracy. For example, the iPhone states they're at 58% and 61% one moment and then you plug them in and they drop instantly to 10% and 12%. In this day of the increased proliferation of conference calling and Zoom meetings, it sucks not being confident that your audio isn't just going to cut out completely and unexpectedly on you. If I had noticed a week ago I would have returned them, but my window is now closed and I can only hope for the best.\", \"These are the BEST Bluetooth earbuds I've ever used in my life . I've been using Bluetooth since 2003 and people have never been able to hear me well (likely cause if my beard) The Airpod Pros sound perfect and people hear me perfectly.  The noise cancellation and transparency features are obviously magic .\", \"sadly as good as they sound and feel - none of the three ear sizes that are supplied fit -  and they pop out .... if they could solve this it would be a 5 Star product.  but if you can't keep them in your ear - they are simply not worth much... also the mic is too sensitive on calls and people complain about noises.\", 'If you’re someone why has tiny ears you may have some trouble getting these to STAY in your ears while running/etc. I’ve tried the small, medium, and large rubber pieces that it came with and unfortunately they all fall out as soon as I start to run. Sound quality is better than first generation AirPods but now I only wear the pros around the house to be safe since losing one would be really expensive.', 'I bought these as a gift for my husband’s birthday. He loves them. These are the first pair he’s owned so we can’t compare to previous versions. The adjustable earbud inserts are nice and soft so they don’t bother his ears. Overall the charge holds awhile but once they’re less than halfway through, it won’t make it through the whole day. Great purchase and couldn’t beat the price anywhere else!', 'Only cancels noise on my end. Ex: it blocks the noise around me so I can hear more clear but does not minimize the sound for the person I’m speaking with for them to hear me more clear. Sound is very low when listening to music even when phone sound is at maximum volume. Worse investment I’ve ever made.', 'One of the most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever owned. Sound quality is really good. Pairing with an apple phone is effortless, it does it automatically every time the buds are removed from the case. Battery life could be better but what can you expect from such a compact, light earbud. Battery life is better with some other brand earbuds but you will compromise on weight, fit & comfort. I was able to purchase these Apple earbuds on Black Friday before Christmas for $169, great price!', 'Bought these used (very good) and the right one didn’t work, Amazon needs to step up their inspection on used electronics and put things through the test, what a waste of time I really wanted these before my trip guess I’ll be buying them through Apple instead, only reason why I bought them through Amazon was because 2 day shipping, I’m very disappointed', 'I like the sound quality. I did not like the fact that the right one still falls out of my ear with the largest tip and a good seal. I did not like it that the phone has to be at least upgraded to at least 13 or limited functionality.', 'Yes am very happy with them. I gave them 4 stars because it comes with a new style charger cord and not a block to fit it. The cord is the small USB and it doesn’t fit in my current block.', 'I was skeptical at first because basic EarPods were painful to wear. However, the smallest ear cushion solved the problem and I have really enjoyed using these since. The sound is great, they remain in place while exercising, and I’m very happy with this purchase.', \"They keep slipping out of my ear, so design wise not the best. Battery life is also mediocre compared to Monster Air Clarity which is worth half the price. The mic and software available on Apple devices is the only plus. Overall I personally can't justify the price tag for the product, but i'm keeping it since I need good bluetooth headphones with a mic for meetings.\", 'Sound and noise cancellation are great. Transparency mode is great. Easy to use in Apple ecosystem. But they are practically unusable because they keep falling out even with the largest rubber buds! $250 foe elite, top of the line, trendsetting Rolex of earbuds and Apple cannot figure out how to keep them in people’s ears. Other folks were able to find a solution: use memory foam ear buds so they expand a little in your ear canal.', 'There are way too many things for me to say on how much I love these earbuds so simply... The sound quality is amazing and the BASS is just right, Works very well with the rest of my Apple products. All I need now is a nice leather case which I am waiting for from INCASE or NATIVE UNION. You CANNOT go wrong with this purchase and I was lucky to buy them on Amazon on sale!!', \"I like the noise cancellation. Other than that, it would fall out of my ear until I switched the earpieces from medium to a small. Lastly, the battery life is only ~4hrs so you have to plan when you're going to use them. Another good thing is they charge quick but 4 hours isn't enough for me. These are legit Apple ones because I typed in the serial number in the Apple Website. I recommend you to buy a case for these because dust particles accumulate easily.\", 'Finally Apple got it right!  These will fit anyone’s ears without having to constantly put on and take off extra fitting for them to securely stay put.  Battery life could be better but the charging case charges them really fast so I’m ok with it.  All in all happy with the purchase.', 'They sound great, noise canceling works very nicely I work in a construction (loud) can’t hear hardly anything. If you do anything except lay in bed I’d get a protective case I scratched up the case pretty bad first month. After three months they started having buzzing noise and connectivity issue, granted they did get a bit wet a few times. Apple replaced but still a pain for $200 I would hope for better. Pretty typical Apple tho just get the extended warranty.', \"What a waste of money... 2 months in and the right side won't charge no matter what I do... There is nothing blocking the connectors, it simply won't charge. It started disconnecting during usage for a few days, now won't work period. Don't waste your money on these.\", 'Overall these are better than the AirPods 1 and 2. The noise cancellation is great for louder environments (but you have to play music to actually notice that it works. The weird thing is that unlike the AirPods 1 and 2 the pros like to fall out of my right ear from time to time. Would recommend getting on sale.', 'as we all know apple is a very expensive company.. I guess you could say these are an 8.5/10. I have the Sony WH-1000XM4 they’re like $350 and they are a lot nicer than these. they are a great alternative to the wired headphones from Apple though', 'These Airpods Pro surprised me with what they offer overall. The sound quality is good, battery coupled with the charging case means you can use them all day. The noise cancellation really blew me away and still does its really nice. An the seamless pairing with iphones is a wonder making the over value of the Airpods even better. The other features like the squeeze to turn noise cancellation on and off are really nice and just elevate the product even more. I would recommend if you are and iPhone user to pick up a pair of Pros.', \"I'll be honest. I produce music for a living so if you are an audiophile seeking the highest quality when it comes to sound, these arent for you. That being said, they sound absolutely amazing for the price. The transparent and cancellation modes are honestly a game changer. I ride BART in the bay area which is obnoxiously loud and I cant hear a thing when music is playing. I hear people complaining about how easy they are to lose but honestly thats a user error so dont be dismayed. Put these in your ears and you'll have a tough time losing them because theyll stay there.\", 'LUEGO DE  1 MES DE USO NO LE FUNCIONAN LOS MICROFONOS Y UNO DE LOS DOS ES EL QUE SE ESCUCHA, Y SE ESCUCHA MUY BAJO.

They are expensive but I guess they are worth it. I do not use earphones but he speaks highly of them. These are his favorite pair of earphones he has ever had. He says the noise cancellation is really nice when he is in the gym.\", 'I love these so much, I got my first job a couple months ago and I wanted to reward myself on keeping good savings and working hard. So I bought these… I love these so much, the balancing is immaculate and although yes they are expensive (its apple ofc they’re expensive) they could improve just a little on the bass. Other than that, these are amazing and I could not recommend them enough to another person who enjoys relaxing and listening to music without getting caught up in the self-tangling mess of normal earbuds.', 'I like the sound quality, and the transparency mode, but the noise cancellation mode could be better. It filters background noise but does not block it, you can still hear. Also these HURT my ears horribly! If I put them in correctly they are terribly uncomfortable to wear! I expected more for the price.', 'I gave my Apple AirPods Pro a four star review because I had to go and buy aftermarket memory from tips. I tried several different sizes that were included with the product, but no matter what I did the AirPods would fall out over and over again!', 'Way better then the AirPod Gen 1’s if your sitting with a older pair wondering if these are worth it I’d say buy them. Much better then expected very impressed with the package these pack in such a small AirPod', \"I bought these for my wife's birthday. She loves them!

Great option for us.', 'I have been very pleased with these ear pods! The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is impressive. What was probably more impressive than that is turning off the noise cancellation--you can still hear the audio but also the ambient sound. Great if you need to hear traffic or someone coming up behind you. These are great!', 'I’ve only had these for a couple of days but I’m very impressed. My old set died, I also have a different brand’s set, but these are great. I love that it came with different ear tips, stays put better than my old pair.', 'I ordered these for my husband and he really enjoys them.

Apple replaced the broken left pod. Now the right pod is doing the same thing. This time apple would not replace the pod. For the cost of these pods, they should last more than a year and a half!! The sound was awesome but it dis not last. Buy another brand.', 'Lost confidence after two sets.  Both sets gave me technical problems. I do not recommend.', 'I got these for running,  they absolutely do not stay in.  Easily come off my ears, and yes I tried different ear pieces.  They don’t stay in.

I would definitely recommend.', 'I purchased these to replace my wired headphones because we were getting ready to travel 6 hours on the plane to see family.  I was worried that they would not reduce the sound on the plane (I need complete quite to sleep).  Well, they sure did drown out all of the noise.  I even used them at bedtime because my husband snores so loud he seriously could wake up the neighbors.  Not a sound!  Best product I ever purchased.', 'I usually don’t spend more than $50 or so for good earbuds/headphones but I have to say, for less than $200 (at this time), it’s a gamble that’s paid off.

Of course, now that I bought them, Apple will introduce a newer model but that’s ok.', 'This is must have if you own an iPhone! I was able to get this stacked with an AMEX promo, but i do recommend this even full retail price after using it. Syncs up with your iPhone seamlessly, it wirelessly charges and the ANC is pretty good for its size and form factor. The ANC is not going to top Bose or Sony over the ear cans, but for its size, it’s really to travel and not worry about the bulk of the big canned headphones. Cons will most likely be with its retail price and lack of a way to adjust volume. Adjusting the volume a big deal to me but that’s just personal preference. If you have an iPhone, this is simply a no brained with its minor setbacks. Comfy in the ears, great ANC, wireless charging and small form factor.', \"I don't have hard-to-fit ears, but these ear buds were the most uncomfortable ear buds I have ever used.

I was on the verge of buying Bose, but saw a deal on these air pod pros and looked at the reviews. 200,000 plus reviews with a 5 star rating. So I gave them a shot. Extremely impressed as of now. Amazing noise canceling and good sound quality. Could use more bass but it still is acceptable. I recommend the pros', 'I have never reviewed an Apple product. In my humble opinion, their products should perform without fault as the price we pay for them is a premium. However, this product, I felt, performed far above the cost.

Noise cancelation is really great and she couldn't be happier\", \"These by far are the best, I drive a garage truck for a living sm and I'm able to speak clearly and be heard with the noise canceling. The sound quality is great as well. I wish the battery life was longer though. You get 4 to 5 hours of battery life before recharge is necessary. Which is not bad. I've bought all kinds of brands believe me it was sad. I tried to avoid the price of these but the AirPods have been worth every penny. And they are comfortable as well. You forget they are in your ears. I use them with a pixel and it works great.\", 'Arrived timely as promised. Earpieces work as intended, you could hear the difference between the regular Airpods and the Pros, especially in noise cancellation. Only wish they were cheaper, still hefty purchasing it with sales promotion', 'The AirPods come with a cable, but no charger! The cable is different than the one for my iPhone. I have new AirPods and no way to charger them! Now I have to buy a charger. WHY?!', 'They worked great for about a year and a half, but now I cannot use them. One AirPod squelches loudly when I put it in my ear, and buzzes periodically depending on the sounds coming in. Turning off noise cancellation helped at first, but no longer.', 'I am able to pair these on my android phone and the sound is still fantastic. The noise canceling works well when talking on the phone or listening to music. They stay in my ears when running on the treadmill too.', 'These are amazing! I’ve always preferred the silicone tip style ear buds. They fit comfortably in the ear and stay in place. The noise cancellation is a game changer! The main reason I got them is because of the noise cancellation. I work in a very loud shop, doing blue collar and with the noise cancellation, it shuts out so much of the unwanted noise. It’s like combining ear plugs with ear buds! The transparency mode is good too! While I don’t think I’ll be using that mode as much it’s good for talking if you don’t want to take them out. Overall, a great product. Would highly recommend!', \"I was shocked that earbuds could work noticeably to drown out background noise (lots of it).  It doesn't work so well that an emergency will go unnoticed, but it allows you to think with much less distraction.  And they are pretty easy to connect.  I was most surprised that they stay in place.  I agree with the high ratings.\", 'These are insane im writing this review a year later and everything still seems just as good as the first day I bought them. Battery life is still pretty decent sound quality and mic works excellent definetly recommend them to anybody!', \"Bought these for my partner. His old air pods were starting to break after years of use. Surprised him with these and he's spend an hour so far just listening to podcasts and music - he's really impressed.\", \"I was gifted the first airpod for Christmas, I've always wanted a pair, but when I got them they wouldn't stay in my ear. With the Airpods Pro they have the little earbud cushion and once I connect them in they automatically tell me if I have the perfect fit for my ear. EVERYTHING about these ear phones are absolutely WONDERFUL!! I have told everyone I know about how much better the pros are versus the original ones.\", 'I love the support, battery life and it’s easy to use.', 'I love everything about these. The only probably is that they pop out of my ears every 15min. The normal air pods I can put in and forget about. These I know I will lose eventually. I’m on the fence about sending them back or not, I’m going to do some more research into third party attachments. If I can’t find anything decent I’m going to have to send them back 😭. On the plus side. The Sony MXIII are better for the same price, only problem is that they are giant over ears lol', 'These AirPods are great! Excellent sound quality, love the two modes of listening especially since I often walk on the street and I need to hear car or bike traffic.  I can hear, as well as be heard clearly, while on a phone call. Highly recommend!', 'Absolutely love these! My only complaint is that sometimes they fall out of my ears. I have small ear canals. I had to purchase silicone hooks to go around my ears and they work better for me. Great sound and live the noise canceling feature!!', \"Another superb product from Apple. I had the standard AirPods previously, but love the upgrade. The Noise Cancellation is very impressive, and they fit so much better than the Standards. I'm thrilled as usual, been an Apple Disciple for 20 years!\", 'One of my favorite things. Rarely falls out in gym. Must have for yard work. Can be used under headphones when using loud equipment. Makes shoveling snow enjoyable. Connects automatically to phone. I always had the $15 Bluetooth earbuds with the ear clips and connecting wire. These are so worth the money.', 'I love my new AirPods!!! They are so perfect for the gym, and they are the real deal. My only issue is that when I first received them I got a defective pair, but Amazon was quick to fix this for me and sent me a new pair and a label to ship back the old ones. Love it!', 'I was skeptical buying this Apple Airpods Pro from Amazon because of the reviews, etc. Some says it’s a counterfeit. I’ve been outwit of some sellers for so many times here. But I tried, got an insurance for it and it’s been great since I had it.', 'Sound is out of this world. The noise cancelling is amazing, I run a lot of fans in my house, so the ambient noise is high most of the time. I put these Airpods in and squeeze the Airpod handles (not sure what you call it) and it makes a sound and then all background noise is gone. I would only ask for longer battery life as mine only last about 4 hours or so before I have to recharge them. Otherwise, I am beyond happy with my purchase.', 'Sound quality is GREAT!  Only reason for 4 on noise cancelling is because I don’t get a secure connection in my ear once I start sweating. Not sure how to solve that. Not working out though the noise cancelling is great!  Haven’t had an issue with batt life since I’ve had them. Just put them back in case when done using them with the batt charge optimizer on. Feeling good about these. I think I like them better than some Sony buds I’ve got. Ijs!', 'I absolutely love my Apple Airbud Pros!  The sound quality is excellent.  When connected with my iPhone, I can use my  music to give me a little retreat from the world.  Also, using it to make/take calls, they free up my hands and the quality of the conversation is great!', \"wasn't sure if these were a real Apple product.  Looked it up and they are.  The noise cancelling is amazing! My only issue is one of them just doesn't not really stay in my ear that well.\", \"Right off the bat they were defective. 90% of the time only one side would work and it would turn noise cancellation on and off randomly. Had to go to two different Apple stores to first prove to them that they were defective and then also get them replaced. Wasted about 3 hours of my day trying to get them replaced and had to drive about 30 miles. 10/10 would not recommend buying these online as you won't know if they work until they're delivered. Only good part about it was they come with a limited warranty.\", 'Genuine product But the silicon ear tips are small They come in different sizes and even the large ones are small for my ear Afraid that they might fall down without me even actually realizing it Apart from that, great noise cancellation', 'Bought two of these, my first one got stolen. It’s fantastic overall, but be warned that if they get lost and you aren’t connect/near them, say goodbye to $200. Sometimes they get dirty also and stuck in the ear tips so watch out when cleaning them to prevent breaking them. Lastly, I feel like the recent updates made the noise cancellation worse but it still does it job.', 'First, I am using these with a Dell/Windows XPS 15 9560 laptop and a Samsung Galaxy S9 phone. Issues: 1. Zoom meetings 2. Manually switching between phone and laptop 3. Metallic sounding sometimes 4. Shows up twice in Bluetooth 5. Not as noise canceling as the marketing made them seem to be 6. Batter life is a joke 7. There is more but I am stopping now', 'My husband surprised me with these (as I would never spend that amount of money on myself) and I couldn’t be happier! The ease of use (no cord, yay!) and sound cancelation are unbeatable. The battery life doesn’t seem to be the greatest but easy enough to pop back in the charging case to recharge.', 'The AirPods Pro are the ultimate wireless earbuds, which offer noise cancelling, water resistance and a customization fit buds with every purchase. they are definitely an upgrade from the 1st air-pods and are worth the extra bucks you spent on them. I got them a little cheaper with Amazon and the product was an original item. Yes, the battery life could be longer. But the AirPods Pro are the best wireless earbuds you can buy.', 'They do cancel out noise as long as the noise outside isn’t too loud and you have the headphones in properly and the sound quality is good as well. This are my first noise canceling headphones and I’m not disappointed.', 'I LOVE using them for phone calls! Or walking around the house. I really like them for music. I got them because my brother recommended them after watching all these tech review video. I now suspect those reviewers did not have long hair. During transparency mode the microphones on the outside of the pieces can be brushed by hair or a hand moving the hair and it sounds a little bit like a wave of static over what you’re listening too when the microphones get touched. I gave only 4 stars just because I’ve heard better before', 'I love these things! Very useful for me, since I work as a janitor and these cancel out the vacuum noise so I can listen to my music without any other distracting nosies. Plus, the transparency feature lets me keep the buds in when someone is talking to me. I love that!', 'If you’re thinking about buying these, just buy them. Worth the sound quality, noise cancellation, and the convenience. They barely feel like you’re wearing headphones and when the music starts playing you can just get lost in the sounds. Buy them.', \"Typical Apple-- works seamlessly iphone. Sound is 'way' better than $20 dollar wireless earbuds I used before. Sound cancellation isn't up to a Bose level by any means but it does seem muted. As with any earbuds--- watch out that they do not fall out!\", 'These are amazing!  A friend had the Pro model & was raving about them. So glad I purchased these easy to use. The sound quality and noise cancellation features are wonderful - well worth the extra price. I recommend these highly!', 'They showed up looking almost brand new, no damages or scratches. I did buy them used so I was surprised to see them in good condition. Unfortunately there was damage to the left charging port for the airpod, meaning they would not connect to any phone. Had to send them to Apple for repairs… which has taken over a month, but that’s not the air pods fault. Just wish they were tested before they were resold.', \"I love the noise cancelation/transparency mode feature, but you need a good seal for it to work right.  My ears don't have a lot of wax or anything but if I don't clean them and my ears like every day and twist them just right into position they refuse to stay in my ears.  When they do work they are great, but I can't give a better review if I paid this much and they don't stay in.  Regular apple earbuds, or other silicon tips work fine, but this material is super slick and they just slide out.\", 'Phenomenal buds. I’ve tried all the other top brands and these have fairly equitable sound (meaning it is awesome for an ear bud) and much better call quality. Noise cancellation is amazing. Great fit with no concern of buds falling out. I gave 4 stars because there is no volume control on the headphones, so you have to control volume using phone. Minor inconvenience for me.', 'Overall the AirPods works great but I think they Apple could’ve done better.  It’s annoying that you can’t control volume without taking out your phone.  Easy to sync with iPhone or other devices and talking on the it is very clear.  Sometimes it falls out when I am working out.', \"Having already had the regular AirPods, I was hesitant to purchase these as they were much more expensive.  Now that I have them, they're great.  Switched to the small covers and they hurt my ear for several days.  Switched back to the medium and I can hardy tell I'm wearing them.  Great sound and features.\", \"Never dropped, abused, or mistreated. Left AirPod reported a 255% battery on OS X a few weeks ago, went back to normal after resetting them, now the left AirPod will not take a charge at all. The warranty still requires you to pay for replacements... Think I will just buy another company's product!\", 'I tried S,M,L and was not able to get a good fit consistently.  The battery life is extremely poor.  You would expect for $250 they would at least be good if not great.  They fall out of my ear easily even when not moving.  Not able to return them during the COVID-19 lockdown.  They make me furious to use.', 'It worked fine at the beginning but nowadays it disconnects and cannot connect to Bluetooth or the headset just stops working. The left side earbud sounds like it’s been underwater. I’m going to return and try to order it off the official Apple website because I feel like mine were somewhat defective or something.', 'They work as expected. I wish find my iPhone worked when they were in the case, since I sometimes misplace the case. Sometimes they slip out of my ear when I am working out, so I have to nudge them back in when I feel them slipping.', \"Good fit, good sound.  I haven't been able to switch from using them with my iPhone XS to my iPod Touch.  I'm sure it can be done, but haven't figured it out yet.  I may head to an Apple Store to get assistance.  So far, I love them!  I would purchase them again.\", 'The sound quality blew my mind. You feel like the sound is surrounding you. I really like how you can deactivate or activate the noise cancellation depending on your listening environment. I have not had to charge but once in the first two weeks I have had them.', 'I had connectivity problems with my iPhone 12 Pro Max since day one. Sent them in using the warranty and still they can’t stay connected. I would stay away from these and stick with the original ones.', 'They are great except they are uncomfortable  inside for some people. Had to return them. I tried memory foam tips and still after an hour or so it was unbearable  inside the ear and much less all day for working from home and taking calls. I also didnt like you cant change the volume without actually going to the device. Noise cancelling is great and sound quality is ok.', 'They ARE NOT for the gym, constantly falling out (even when i put the small plugs on them) I honestly dont see the hype over them i should have probably went with beats', 'Kept falling out of my ears. Purchased different items to keep them from falling out, but they would leave my inner ear sore. Then after six months, one stopped working. Too much time passed, to return.', 'Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase.  These headphones are comfortable, the noise cancelling is excellent and the sound quality is very good - much better than regular airpods, and what I would expect for a premium wireless earbud, but the sound quality is not likely to impress true audiophiles. I wasn’t sure if these would be as convenient as my AirPod 2 earbuds, but they have replaced them in daily use entirely.  While they are not as comfortable as my Sony WH-1000XM3 over the ear headphones, the noise cancelling is almost as effective and has reduced my use of the Sony headphones to only extended use sessions. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and recommend these headphones.', 'Bought these for my husband for our anniversary. He loves them! He wears them mowing and says the noise cancellation is a great feature. He says they’re much better than the ear phones he was using.', \"Where to start....  Bottom line is that these things are close to great but seem to fail every time. a)  They will not stay in your ears reliably.  Good luck finding them once they drop out. b)  Mic noise reduction is inconsistent and irritating / distracting to the other party c)  Eventual development of a rattling noise.  Appears to be a 'when' not 'if'  Google airpod pro rattling d)  Battery life deteriorates quickly.  You will get maybe 12 - 18 months of use. Overall, they are great, even perfect at first but start failing and get annoying quickly.\", 'By far the best Bluetooth headphones I’ve ever used. The noise canceling option is way beyond expectations and they function well with Apple iPhone, iPad, Apple TV... I was actually shocked I was able to mow with these on and still have the audio at a safe level.  Besides the noise canceling there is a certain level of noise isolation if you properly fit the tips.', 'Battery life is awesome, I’ve never had my Airpods die. The case battery lasts about a week (5 days). Transparency mode is AMAZING, it’s as if you don’t have any Airpods at all (noise amplifiers). Noise cancelling is pretty amazing as well for in-ear!', \"Much better sound quality than regular AirPods and noise cancellation is amazing. However, I don't usually get the advertised 4.5 hours on a charge and usually get around 3.5 hours even though I've only had them for a few months.\", 'was excited to get these from here, my last ones were stolen, but not even 2 months in, the left airpod is messed up, causing constant static while my music plays & rattling whenever i move my head in any direction. it’s annoying to only use my right one for phone calls or when I’m on the go & have to use my wire headphones for when i want to listen to music', 'So I purchased these about a month ago and when I first got it they worked perfectly, the past couple days i noticed only one AirPod would work at a time when i had both in my ear the problems still began after pairing and unpairing so many times and it still not working together I had to return these for another pair. I’m going to give Amazon another chance but if the next ones give me the same issues I’ll just get my money back and go directly through apple.', 'Great for blocking sound.  Better on newer iPhone app with enhanced feature! Too bad volume can’t be controlled from device.  Can be connected to iPhone, iPad, and watch at the same time.  You can switch between devices to use.  Battery life seems very short!', \"These Airpods pro have better sound quality and nosie cancellation than my Powerbeat Pro, and they're also more comfortable. They don't fit my ears very well, so they fall out often. But this issue is fixed by the airpods pro hooks. Battery life isn't as good as my powerbeat pro.\", 'Be careful, defective products are out there and that’s what I got the first time.  The right AirPod would drain 30% faster than the left one for me (for example, left one would read 74% and right would be at 44%), but thankfully Amazon sent me a new pair of these free of charge, I didn’t even have to pay for shipping to send the old ones back. A small inconvenience, but I’m relieved that I was able to fix this issue without spending an extra dime, only a short drive to the UPS store. Aside from that, it’s about what you would expect for 230$. High quality sound and amazing features, my only complaint is that I can’t control volume on the AirPod itself, I have to use my phone.', 'The sound quality and \"transparency\" of Amazon ear buds is much better.  The \"transparency\" and noise cancelling of the Decibullz moldable ear buds is better than this Apple product.  The area that Apple wins the day is the small size of the ear bud and the ease of use.  Pairing these with home computer systems and mobile devices...and switching back and forth between them is a breeze.  If either other other two products fit smaller ears better and were as compatible, I would have stuck with them.', 'These were a great gift for my husband for his birthday and they came way faster than expected and were cheaper than competitor prices! Great purchase and great gift.', 'Fantastic.  Great sound, even better than the first two versions of AirPods.  I have one of each version.  Battery in the ear buds last longer.  Comfortable but stay in ear better.  Noise canceling is nice, but not that big a deal for me.', 'The upgrade from wired headphones to wireless alone is enough to make these 5 stars. The connection range is decent, enough to walk across your house but not enough to take out the trash. Sound quality and battery life are just as good as you’d expect, noise canceling is definitely new technology and it shows, but for a tiny earbud it does great.', '• Great quality and noise cancellation • Very Stylish and adjustable in ear pieces • Great Price • Authentic air pods • Very sturdy and not easy to break • Overall 5/5', 'Exactly  WhatsApp I was expecting it to be. It is comfortable. Sound is great. The only thing that should be improved is it’s audio controls.', 'Purchased for my sons birthday. He wears these while mowing the lawn and says they are amazing. The do cancel out the noice from the mower. These fit just right in the ear and the sound is amazing', 'These were the first wireless pods I have purchased and I am very pleased.  Great quality as expected. But the sound and noise cancelation works way better than I could Imagine for a pod. Battery life also solid.', 'The sound is wonderful. When I know people are coming I only wear one at a time or I can’t hear them talking. I’ve gone through several sets before being told about these. These are the first pair that work with your phone calls. I run a dog kennel and I need to block out the barking. They really work!  Highly recommended! AAAA++++', 'Yes, they do sound better; however, I’m glad I got them on sale for cost of the AirPods with out the wireless case because I don’t know if they are $90 better sounding. Definitely better sounding and newer technology but.... If you could get them without the wireless case for the price of the regular with the wireless case, ($199) that would be a better deal.', 'Got these for my daughter for Christmas. They were not the ones she wanted, and I was planning to return them, but when she decided to try them, she absolutely loved them. She says they’re very comfortable and the sound block is extremely effective.', 'I hate this design, the AirPods fall QUITE EASILY from my ears. If I’m using them and I laugh or chew something, they fall in a second. I don’t feel comfortable using them (even though the sound is really great), but the fit is AWFUL. Also, the battery life is terrible. It immediately goes down 2-3% listening to a 1min voice note. The AirPods 1-2 fit WAY BETTER.', 'I was expecting something more about noise cancellation, but probably my expectation were too high. Noise cancellation is a good feature and it allows me to work from home more efficiently. It sensibly reduce our \"home noise\"...', 'I ride a bike everyday and I wanted something that I could use to listen to audio while riding. I do ~15mph and yet, at that low speed, with NC on, the wind noise is annoying! It works but I still hear wind. May be the best option but not the panacea I was hoping for.', '', 'I am an Apple fan. Over the years I have bought several MacBooks, iPhones, and Apple accessories including AirPods. The AirPods Pro are the most inferior Apple products I have ever purchased.

I did not have nearly as much difficulty with my regular AirPods. My advice: don’t pay the premium and stick with the older model.', 'Sound is great; but if you want to run distance, forget it, they are constantly falling out.  Never had this problem with the older AirPods.  If you doubt my review, try internet search for AirPod Pros keep falling out.', 'I love it I mean it’s an Apple product new technology is great I just wish that things like this we’re not going to be outdated as soon as they pretty much hit the stores you know I wish that things like this could last longer is high and technology especially for the amount of money that you pay for the product', 'If you can get them on sale, like the $169 recently; definitely a buy if you are an apple user.

I just kept them in my ears primarily for telephone calls and very, very little streaming. I was very disappointed with how quickly the batteries ran out.

I like that they can’t fall out of my ears easily. The one thing I don’t like is I can’t stop the ear buds from charging if I only use them for a short period of time before putting them back in the case.

It is a pity that a new product has this problem!', 'I ant gonna pay $250 for this “plastic”, mediocre, amateur sound quality. Period. Grow up Apple. Design and case is very good tho. Controls are garbage, very inconvenient to press on that tiny thing. Tapping is way better. Returned and got Bose instead.', 'These are super high quality. The sound quality is incredible, and the noise cancellation is unbelievable! I have super small ear canals that earbuds never fit into. In the past, the only earbuds that fit were the small buds on the Yurbuds earphones. The small buds on the Airpod Pros fit great even during activity. I love them!', 'Sadly have to return! I’ve had regular AirPods for the past 2 years and loved them. Decided to upgrade to these for the noise cancellation and they made me SO DIZZY. After about 30 minutes I felt so nauseous and almost drunk? I’ve read reviews of other people who had the same issue. Very disorienting and absolutely not worth the price. Also the fact you have to hold the base and click to skip songs as opposed to hitting anywhere on the AirPod seems like a huge downgrade. Longtime apple user, but very disappointed in this product!', 'On my third pair. They sound great for music and the noice cancellation is not bad, but they kept making a clicking sound on phone calls and video calls. Had to have them replaced multiple times for sound issues and burning smell when charging.', 'I was a big fan of the original air pods. But the new design falls out of my ears all the time and it is really annoying. I am switching to another brand.', 'When I first opened up my package, the AirPods weren’t even in the box. But I could forgive that. then I saw that there was hair and fuzz all over the ear buds. So I just wiped the buds down and made sure it was clean. But when I actually go to listen to it, the right headphone doesn’t even work! I can forgive the first two things, it wasn’t that big of a deal. But if I’m spending over 200$ for a pair of headphones I expect them to work! I would’t recommend buying these through amazon. I would recommend directly going through Apple to ensure you get ones that actually work', 'Work perfectly between my watch and phone! Great purchase!

Connectivity with iPhone is as smooth promised, although connecting with other devices like an older MacBook Pro is more imperfect. This need to reset the pairing process whenever I choose to connect my AirPods to a device other than my iPhone warrants the one lost star.

Tried regular and small sizes but both pop out of my ears after a short time talking. They sound great, and I like the noise canceling. It’s not 100% but it’s very good.

I use these for 2 hours a day and the battery is always at 10%. Sometimes, one one AirPod will connect. Not worth the money.', '6 Days out of warranty right AirPod screeches/mosquito noise VERY loudly every time it comes on or noise cancellation changes. Then the audio on the right AirPod is substantially lower than the left.

Of course this happens 6 days out of warranty and they want a fee to repair them. Ridiculous.', 'They started out great but after 10 months they won’t pair anymore they still look brand new but they no longer work then sometimes they show that they are out the case when they are in fact in the case my advice would be to get it from apple and not from Amazon I’ve had a few issues with electronics bought from Amazon and these just add to that list so I’m short buy at your own risk', 'I’m a bit of a snob when it comes to headphones.

The noise cancellation is nice, but not quite the degree of silence I expected or worth the higher price. The sound quality is barely different from the original AirPods, but what I found most surprising was how annoying it was to click the steam.

If you are looking for some new ear buds I would definitely recommend these!', 'The noise reduction function of this headset is invincible, but the battery life loses other brands. I gave it four stars. After a few days I bought it, it dropped in price. I was angry.', 'Have enjoyed fabulous sound and noise cancellation with these earbuds. Comfortable and safe to wear when working out. Wished they had slightly longer battery life, but work great since not worn all day long.', 'The best things about these are their form factor. And that\\'s about it. Many other headphones/earbuds have the same or vastly superior sound quality with more control over sound.

Yes, the sony pair does sound better and cancel out the noise better. HOWEVER, you're basically getting these airpod pros for 20% off which undercuts the sonys.

I play a bunch of basketball and the previous air pods always falls out however, the AirPods Pro actually stays in with a few adjustments every now and then. Nevertheless, I love them, cancels out my annoying sister never ending rants and stays in. Great buy!', 'I’m giving it a 4 star because they keep popping out when I bend down to do daily things.

I received the product as stated from Apple shipped and fulfilled by Amazon.I was worried because a-lot of reviews said these were fake but the ones I received are the real deal. Just for piece of mind Amazon is a BIG company so in the event you don’t receive the product as stated, Amazon customer service is awesome and will get you taken care of. The chance is Very slim and I think the ones that received fake AirPods were not shipped and filled by Amazon.

Battery life is beyond my expectations and they charge quickly in the case.', 'Product is good. But when I opened up the box and charging case the Ear buds looked used and I could see the traces of dust on the ear bud.

But, since we are all at home now, and I am on conference calls daily, they have proven to be very very effective. I wish the noise cancelling was a bit better, but for the convenience of wireless, its a good trade off. Id highly reccomend.', \"I bought these to sync with my mac when I'm traveling for work and they're great. I connected them to my Droid and they're barely passable. I'll do some research to see if I can squeeze better performance out of them. Update later. When your Apple friends tell you an Airpod hack is to only use one at a time to save the batter, you know the battery life is less than desirable.\", 'I really like this product so far, the only problem I have is that I have really small ears and i have to use for one ear the small tips but for the other i would need extra small, which there is no option. You only get three sizes, small, medium and large and if your ears are bigger or smaller you will have a problem because apple doesn’t sell more sizes. I had to buy some from Amazon, but i still love my new airpods. They are really comfortable and the noise cancellation is great if u don’t want to be disturbed.', 'Still trying to work on getting used to using them but so far, they’re amazing.

They also fall out fairly easily.', 'Look, if anyone is debating weather to get the AirPods Pro or the AirPods Max, o recommend getting the AirPods Pro because I’ve had them for some time now and I love the Pros... I just think since there only about a year old and most people are getting these because of the price drops...Also knowing Apple they will probably come out with a more powerful better set of AirPods at the end of this year!!! So if your looking for wireless earbuds I recommend the 2nd edition AirPods but if noise cancellation is a must have than the Pros are for you not the bigger bulkier version that aren’t even portable', \"Great sound quality and very well balanced equalizing.

They do send a newer lightning cable to charge but i have no cube that it fits in.

I can use one at a time or both doesn’t matter. I pair them with my phone  and it’s like I’m in a concert. Can not go wrong great for older children and adults because of the size & cost. These are not disposable.

The noise cancelling feature is spot on, a feature that you can choose to turn on as needed. I’m so happy with them, I waited a long time to get them and I’m not disappointed.', 'When they say “noise canceling” they aren’t playing.

Don’t wear if you have enemies that will run up on you, you will not hear them coming.', 'In my opinion the extra $100 is totally worth it, especially if you travel. My biggest complaint about my old airpods was their performance during a flight. I felt I got way too much engine noise. Although I have not flown yet, the noise cancellation on these is a complete game changer. I also feel like they fit more comfortably in my ear with better quality low sounds.', \"I was initially very impressed these headphones but after six months of use I'm ready to toss them because I'm just frustrated with just how bad they are. The mic is apparently a massive problem during calls, which lead me to stop using them for calls altogether in favor of cheap wired headphones. The ANC has a strange hiss to it which I never saw with my 5 year old Bose headphones. You can listen to music on them with with noise cancelling off and they fit well although not during running or exercise. That's about it. Not worth 250 USD by a long shot\", 'My older version worked amazing and stayed in my ears. These the sound goes in and out and they slide out of my ears every 2 minutes. Not worth the hype. Wish I would have purchased the older version again.', \"I wasn't sure how the noise cancelling would really stack up to over-the-ear headphones. But, it's amazing. As soon as the second ear bud goes in your ear, the noise level automatically drops and the sound quality is great. Easy to run/workout in. Love the wireless charging too.\", \"I really enjoy these headphones. They have been great for conference calls so far. Switching between devices is super easy. As for icing on the cake, apple has really made the user experience wonderful. You can charge wirelessly, and putting them on, it doesn't immediately enable noise canceling, instead, it transitions into it (over a 1 second period). Its like being gracefully whisked away to another world. For me, the things that still bother me are the 4 hr battery life and the feel that it might fall out. Granted, they haven't fallen out yet, and have stayed in regardless of how I move my head (and I'm not being gentle). Wish they had one more smaller earbud size.\", '1: don’t stay in ear while exercising 2: their is a lot of noise, buzzing, and occasionally a tea kettle shrieking. 3: they lose connection easily and I’m constantly having to re-pair them with my phone.', 'Compact size makes these AirPods the best available NC earphones. The NC is above average but not comparable to the Headphones like Bose and Sony MX400.

Availability and small form factor are what matter to me the most even though the NC is not as great as the Headphones.', 'I have bought 3 or 4 sets of cheap ear buds.  Thought I was saving $$$.

It claims to be customizable but the customizable tips don’t help at all. The hard buds are so large that my ears begin hurting very quickly. The other issue is the button that you are supposed to “tap” to pause, skip, etc. It isn’t a tap. It’s more of a click that is so hard to make I frequently give up and use my phone. My son has $40 off brands that are better than these.', 'The noise canceling these headphones offer is better than anything I’ve ever tried. They’re comfortable enough to fall asleep in. And, the fast changing is super convenient.', 'I love these things. Better life isn’t the best if you’re listening to music for hours straight, but it isn’t bad. I was skeptical on spending so much money for these but I am glad I did. I spend a lot of time on the phone every day and the wireless Bluetooth is very nice. Glad I bought them.', 'The active noise cancellation is excellent. After inserting the left pod, all ambient sounds just disappear. A loud TV fades to sounding like it is in the next room. The sound quality is very good. Not as good as my high end Grados, but close. And, the Grados don’t have noise cancelation.', 'These are worth every penny and I’m a preacher of the cheap. I gawked at my daughter for paying so much for her pair, but here I am eating my words, like it or not. Clarity in the voice and warmth in the bass like you can’t believe, it’s joy joy for your ears.  Add to these the clear clean Apple Music, like having Willie was right in front of you strumming his old guitar. Now if we could just buy a set of home monitors that produced this quality and technology for less than a heart attack wallet kill.', \"I have tried at least five different brands of headphones and struggled with each in different ways.  The old Apple headphones didn't fit my ears so I never ordered the wireless version.  But I decided to spend the big bucks for the Air Pod Pro and am seriously impressed - they were easy to set up, great sound quality, and THEY FIT!  I know I sound like an ad, but these are hands down the best wireless headphones I've ever purchased - well worth the price.\", 'These were a bit frustrating to get used to - tried all the sizes but they kept sliding out of my ears. In a city, the noise canceling was always OK, but they would crackle during loud noises. Eventually, the noise cancelling stopped working and I sent these in (still under warranty). I was quoted the price of new headphones because there were scratches on the outside. Look elsewhere for a less fragile product.', 'I did not like the function buttons on this product I prefer to use my regular AirPods the noise cancellation was so so, I was hoping to be able to use these to cut the grass but they did not cancel out enough noise. I ended up giving them to my wife and she loves them except for the function buttons. I ended up purchasing a set of plug phones which work fantastic', 'Owned for 1month and right earbud no longer works. I’m an older professional using these earbuds they r not being abused.  Apple will service them for free u just need to be without your newly purchased earbuds for however long this whole process takes. Just a heads up to purchasers of this product. Update returned them to apple and in two days had them back working properly thank you changed rating', 'Love the noise canceling aspect but these have to be the bugs waste of money and the worst AirPods ever to be made. You have to constantly push them back in and they fall right out. I rather use the original ones thankfully I still have them.', 'I’m not going to lie, these are the best earphones I had in a while. The first air pods wasn’t as good as these ones. Noise cancellation is legit, the sound quality is great. The AirPods fall out the ear sometimes if you have it in your ear too long, but other than that they are great.', 'Noise canceling is the best feature! Love it but can’t really work and wear these because they fall out no matter what size ear plug I use. My friends have the same problem with theirs and have a pair of the regular AirPods to use for work or when they sleep because those don’t fall out as much.', 'These headphones really are great. It’s so seamless to use with an iPhone. However, none of the tips were the right size for my ears and the headphones constantly fell out when I worked out with them or even just if I was talking a lot on video meetings with them. I ended up returning them and got the power beats. Just an FYI if your buying them with the intention of working out with them.', \"Upgraded to the pro from the previous generation. The sound is great, noise cancellation good but the fit can be a challenging one, depending on the shape of one's ears.\", 'These are original AirPods! The sound quality is great, though be aware that it decreases if you have an unstable connection (in case you’re on a Zoom call). Gave 4 stars for battery life as there is room for improvement (as with all Apple products). Overall super happy, I use them every day! Would recommend to anyone.', 'Loving my ear pods!  Great sound and mic.  I thought it would completely shut out noise so I can’t hear others but it doesn’t, although whoever I’m talking with can’t hear the excess noise so that’s good.', \"+Damn good audio +Damn good noise cancelling -Noise cancelling doesn't work with only one airpod in -Sometimes audio is crappy (like a hum, usually goes away after a minute) I also have Sony WH-1000XM2 headphones, and as comparison these are within spitting distance. Headphones are better, but Airpods are quite good.\", 'Love the upgrades to this new version of the AirPods!  The earbud style makes ALL the difference. Increases the sound quality and the stability of the fit in ear!  The noise cancelation was a nice touch that I didn’t even know about until I put them in.  Love that you can use them one ear at a time! Such an underrated feature and a lifesaver for working in an office!', \"Loved the first generation, but over time they got very quiet due to earwax, and sweat getting inside. You can clean them up, using a cotton swab or a toothpick and gently clean out the excess earwax or sweat, however, if it's any deeper than that, you won't be able to clean them and they'll stay quiet. Since I didn't want to buy the first-gen pair, I decided to buy this pair, and I heard they have some new features, and I plan on using it very soon. Would recommend it to apple product owners and airpod owners!\", 'Was extremely happy with them initially. The ANC is outstanding and I use transparency mode a lot. They fit comfortably and don’t fall out for me. But after only a few days the right AirPods has already stopped working properly(seal fit test fails mo matter what, and the anc suffers because of it; letting in alot of sound) EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED for the price and will have to go through problems of getting it sorted', 'I was super enthusiastic about the AirPods pro. I have beats studio 3 and the noise cancellation is amazing. I thought it might be as good but I was fooled. At college, the hallways are always noisy and when I turn noise cancellation on, I always hear lot of unwanted noise. As for the sound quality, I am not that impressed but it definitely is better than the 2nd gen AirPods. I listen to more hip hop and rap so I really need to the good bass. I don’t think the bass is enough on these. Despite all of the cons, they are real comfortable. I mean, buying the AirPod pros will be a good option, but not the best option. (I honestly like Bose better).', 'These were worth the extra cost for wireless charging and noise canceling.  We have two pair and they are being used almost every day.  I bought them to use on Zoom/Webex meetings on my Mac and they work great.  Sometimes they lose connection but it is easy to reconnect.', 'Very pleasantly surprised with the noise canceling ability on these. I was looking for a new option when flying to replace my wired Bose noise cancelling earbuds. These are pretty close in capability but far easier to manage with no cords. Use them on calls with my iPhone, iPad and MacBook Pro all the time now. I have not used them while running or exercising, but they do fit pretty snugly in my ears, so I would be confident doing so. I did not have original AirPods, so I can’t compare to those. I would definitely recommend.', 'I use these daily with my iphone. There is static/crackling at low volumes in transparency mode. I haven\\'t tried the disconnect/re-pair fix suggested by \"the internet\". Otherwise, perfect! Sound quality is fine. Excellent for phone calls.', 'This was a gift for my daughter and she loves everything about them.  I bought them mainly for the noise cancelling property.  She has a day long air flight and is very prone to migraine headaches.  I hope this will cancel out the constant drone sound from the airplane allowing her to deplane without a headache lasting 3 days. The ordering was easy and the delivery was prompt.', 'When these arrived, they were already associated with someones gmail account.  that was a bit embarrassing since they were a gift.  I was completely unaware that I was ordering \"used\" earbuds then placing this order.  We will try them for a day or 2 and hope there are no issues.', \"I've had two sets of airpods, and they never fell out of my ears.  Even while running or riding a bike outdoors.  When  I decided to upgrade to these I expected them to perform just as well, but they didn't.  They kept falling out of my ears even though I tried all different sized of buds provided.  Returned.\", 'I’m finding the “Hey Siri” functionality very useful as this is the season for coats and gloves. I can compose and send iMessages, start and stop music, raise or lower volume, even shuffle my playlist and I can start and start workouts on my Apple Watch all without getting my iPhone out or talking my gloves off to get to my Apple Watch.', 'Purchased as a gift for my husband.  He really enjoys using them and was very happy to open his gift and find them.  They shipped quicker than I was originally told they would.  Definitely would recommend this product to others!', 'These iPods have never worked well and were already registered to another person. I was not attempting to buy a used item, and it was not disclosed. They do not work well!!!', 'I bought this product assuming I would have no issue linking it to any of may Apple products, unfortunately they did not pair with any of my devices and I have returned them and will try a different brand. I did try Apple Care to resolve my issue and after going through all the steps he confirmed they must be defective. Hopefully Apple will get back to being more concerned about putting out quality products again as opposed to only being concerned about coming out with new cheap products.', 'It’s super comfortable to use, has multiple ear tips, I used the smaller ones and they don’t fall out. They last about 4 hours for me, unless I’m using noise cancellation which is great by the way. I love the option to let noise though why listening to music, sometimes I like to hear what’s around me when I’m at work. They’re nice and compact, great sound for size. There are other bluetooth headphones which may give you better sound, but they look horrendous because of their design. They only drawback is the color option, if I could it get in black, that would be amazing.', 'Maybe it has to do with your ear canal but these do not cancel noise any better than normal airpods.  The sound quality is the same, just OK in my opinion.  The one thing they may be a little better at is taking a call in a noisy area. Sound quality is a little better than regular airpods but I prefer my regular airpods to these at the gym.  May try Bose next....', 'Besides staying in my ear and not feeling like they will fall out at any moment, they are comfortable.  I like that you can switch between noise canceling and transparency so you can have a conversation without having to take one out.  Phone calls are great through them.  The charging case always keeps them charged up.', 'Pros: Great in ear feel Stays in ear during workouts Cons: Not sure if I had a defective pair or what but the signal between my phone and the AirPods would constantly go out. Placed in my hoodie pocket, goes out. Placed in pants pocket, goes out. Held in my phone perfect connection no issues. Return after day 2 couldn’t take the constant loss of signal for simple activities', 'I had such high hopes with this but honestly disappointed - I use tons of apple products and ordered this for a good price during the holidays. It is not Amazon’s fault, it is Apple’s to be clear. The battery life is absolutely terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. I wish I had gotten the newest powerbeats, they sound better and last longer.. They do look super tech stylish 👍🏽', \"Found this great deal during Thanksgiving and decided to buy it as it was being sold by apple store. On unpackaging the left ear piece was not working at all. Had to get them replaced at the local apple store. Super convenient, the noise cancellation works nicely. Would strongly recommended these for anyone who's looking to buy in-ear headphones.\", 'Noise cancellation works great. Connecting to my devices usually is flawless, although there is often a delay in showing the battery percentages or it simply never comes up. Sound quality is good, not great and won’t blow you away, but the functionality of these is so great that more than offsets the sound quality.', 'Writing this review after about a month or so of frequent use. I am really happy that I went with the pro after a personal recommendation. I love how comfortably they adjust and fit. Also the setting options for noise cancellation are extremely convenient switching back and forth between work and leisure mode. Would recommend.', 'Typical classic Apple quality and creative work. Surprisingly powerful, incredibly confortable, noise canceling that really works. Unfortunately too expensive and it was hard to get at the launch. Glad I got them on prime day! That’s a good day!', \"Best true wireless headphones ever. I've owned many pair in the past and this is the best. Best fit, best noise cancelling, great to wear at the gym, sweat proof and water resistant. Overall Apple really pulled it off when it comes to headphones. Most importantly the discounted price Amazon sells at is just enough reason to own this.\", 'These are a hug upgrade over the Airpod Gen 1 and should have prob updated sooner, but the price drop was coming and it was well worth the wait. The noise cancellation on these is crazy, battery life is better and they are much smaller and very comfortable. Love these', \"Cannot get them to stay in my ears. I love the ANC but while using them while running the snowblower one fell out and luckily found it. Just can't trust them. Tried all the sizes provided but my size must be in between. My son has a pair and runs with them with no issues. Hoping some third party comes out with more sizes or options.\", 'I purchased these on 4/1/2020 to work from home. Quality was great when they were working. They stopped connecting to my iPhone XR on 7/31/2020. No damage. No apparent reason for failure. Went through troubleshooting only to find the right airpod was getting extremely hot. Apple support determined that both needed to be replaced. Its been over a week with 4 online chat sessions and 3 calls back and I only have the replacement for the left airpod. If yours fail, be prepared for a seemingly endless loop of chat sessions and call backs with Apple to get your problem partially resolved.', 'I was looking for AirPods Pro but wasn’t not expecting to get a great deal on Amazon they were more lower than at the Apple Store. The quality is great and they are real apple product.', 'These are great! I love the noise cancellation, it works really well when I’m on the phone walking across a bridge over the highway in my town, I used to not be able to hear the person on my old headphones but with the noise cancelling I can hear them perfectly.  I do wish the battery life was longer, but they definitely work for a solid few hours. Zoom works great, I love how they pair to both my phone and computer at the same time, and pair immediately upon putting one in. Effortless to use.', 'I love these! The option to use the noise cancelling feature or not is so convenient and the noice cancelling works so well! I like that they give you different sizes earbuds. The only downside in my opinion is that it doesn’t come with the usb-c charging block, only the cable. It didn’t bother me though because you can use your iPhone charger just fine. However, if you do care about that you will have to buy the charging block separately.', 'They are so comfortable.  They also seal well inside the ear & shut out all outside noise. The original AirPods hurt my ears.  The sound is also improved.  So pleased !  Bought a 2nd pair for my husband.', 'Great for mowing!!', 'The problem with Apple air pods pro is that you cannot change the ear pad. The buds fall out of my ears, are not a close fit.  Other ear buds that I’ve seen come with a variety of pieces to form a good ear fit.  These don’t!  Change it up, Apple!', \"I really love the way these work with the Apple devices. You put them on and they connect in an instant. There's 3 audio modes: Noise Cancellation (8/10), Regular (10/10), and Noise Transparency (9/10). I've noticed that using Noise Cancellation and Transparency tends to drain battery slightly but noticeably more. Overall a great buy especially with the new features coming with Apple Music!\", 'I like the freedom but even the size small bud doesn’t help keep it in well and it hurts my ears after a while. If I accidentally brush it with my arm putting something away or bend over it will usually fall out.', 'having a hard time with hear-thru and also with noise cancellation. probably just user not used to the operating procedures battery life not as good as i’d like, i’ll let you know as i use it and charge it more pairs super and very easy to utilize also very comfortable to wear! Finally phone works in both ears unlike right only for my Bose I think this is going to be a really good buy', 'I bought this as a gift for my fiancé. He works in a very noisy factory and uses them during the day for noise cancelling and music. He said the range is incredible and that the noise cancelling feature is his favorite. He likes them so much that he said he would probably buy me a set so I don’t steal his! HA!', 'I bought the AirPods for my husband to use with his iPhone X. They work very well, but even better than that is how well they perform when he’s working on editing and recording. A real game-changer for his business, and well worth every cent. Now I have them on my wish list!', 'More than excellent sound quality, noise cancellation is amazing, the only con is they fall out of my ears When I’m moving around. But they sell ear clips for less than $10 that solve the problem.', 'My first pair of AirPods and they have been a great asset during covid when working and sharing space with others.  It helps me zone into my work or meetings and ignore anything else going on around me. Battery life could be better, as there are times that I have multiple meetings back to back.', 'I tried cheaper ear buds, including AirPod knock offs, and there’s really nothing like the real deal. They sound great, and they have excellent battery life. Like all things apple, they just work.', \"So disappointed in these new Airpod Pros.  What a waste of money.  I should have just stuck with my old original Airpods.  Noise Cancellation does not work at all.  Can't get any of the ear attachments to fit correctly for my left ear.  I don't notice any improved quality of sound compared to my old Airpods. Totally not work buying the Pros.  Stick with the basic Airpods because the features such as noise cancellation that they tout with the Pros are worthless.\", '', 'I totally got ripped off on these. I gave my daughter my air pods pro and to,d her to keep them, Prime Day was coming. They sold Amazon some busted up products! Last year on Prime Day I bought. Rhumba and it didn’t work either. I should have bought them from Target!!', 'I have always traveled over the years and my headphones have essentially been a big part of my every day routine. I’ve tried Beats By Dre, Sony, Bose, etc. and from the sound quality, noise cancelling, price point, battery life, and convenience of how sleek they slide in the ear and take calls as well... this is a no brainer, MUST BUY. I am in love with my pair. 5/5 stars highly recommend!!!', 'Bought for my daughter as a gift. She loves them and is impressed with all the options. Great purchase! She was thrilled with the noise canceling and ability to share the ear plugs.', 'If i could give ZERO stars, I would. I purchased the Apple Care + product with the AirPods only to find out it didn\\'t appear on the \"real\" Apple website.  This may be refurbished products but NOT genuine new Apple AirPods.  BEWARE.', 'Hate in ear head phones because they hurt my ear and would skip out very easily but these are a game changer. They somehow stay in place and does not hurt at all! May move a bit if my ears get greasy but they do stay pretty well. On the expensive end definitely. Treat yourself this holiday season to these ear phones as they are super convenient and easy to use.', 'Oh my god. These are the best AirPods ever. They have great sound system and we’re great for the price I pass $250 after taxes! I love them. Literally they are always in my ears.', 'Was looking to upgrade from the last pair of earbuds I had and went with these. Audio is nice, you can feel the bass in your music just fine but what takes the cake is noise cancellation. The second I put them on in the gym it went from the deafening sound of cardio machines and screeches of cable equipment to peace and quiet. I also love the fact that when I’m road running I can switch over to transparency mode and hear the traffic around me!', 'Sound quality is pristine.  Love the choice of sizes; smaller size pods stay comfortably in my ears for my entire daily walk.  Wish I had bought them sooner!', 'For the price of these AirPods which offer noise cancellation doesn’t live up to their claims. I found that quality of sound wasn’t that good. I’ve had cheaper pods and they really don’t seem any better than the cheaper one.  Plus they would fall out of my ears which I found them  way to expensive to be take a chance of losing them.', 'i was soooo worried these would be fake or defective after reading some reviews but they work great! i do wish the bass was a little better but oh well. they also definitely weren’t “new” bc they had a name in spanish when i paired them to my phone so it would have been nice to know that ahead of time', \"It is my second order of AirPods Pro from Amazon, as a gift for my GF, and these two works really well!

I have not had these for long but so far I would recommend', 'I collect cans and these are comparable to many of the wired headsets. What I like is the easy Bluetooth setup with the iPhone. Noise cancellation is great and will be easier to wear when flying than headphones. Very fast delivery.', 'Fantastic! I ordered these for my husband after he got me some for Christmas. They were so fantastic that I really wanted him to have a pair. Great purchase! The sound quality is amazing. The ability to connect to my iphone, iPad, or appletv is phenomenal.

I have had Bose, Sony, and others but now I have the best.', \"I know I'm not alone with this review. I love the sound and how it works with my iPhone but the darn buds won't stay in my ears. When I'm seated at my desk working, no problem. When I move around, sooner or later they fall. The buds will fall out if I'm eating. I like them enough to hold on to them. I'm hoping I find a solution to this problem.\", \"I've gone through three pairs of these headphones. The first two I bought for my wife and I, and had some issue with the noise cancellation that caused them to hiss all the time. But the problem arose just after they were out of warranty, so they wouldn't replace them (despite the fact that this was a clear problem with early versions of the headphones, you can Google it). The third pair stopped charging after less than a month, and they refused to replace them, so they are useless to me.\", 'Very comfortable and long battery life.  Ideal for business or personal calls as well as watching movies.  Perfect for air travel with excellent noise cancellation.  Highly recommend.', 'Noise cancellation Is amazing on these. Barely had them and noticed sometimes they sync and other times you have to forget the device and reconnect several times. Charger itself doesn’t charge the right headphone so it’s hit and miss you have both ready to go. Lack of customer service on Apple end to get them replaced even when I purchased Apple car', 'The sound quality isnt a big step up from the original airpods, but the noise canceling changes things. It works almost perfectly in a room full of fans. Sometimes the external microphones that control the noise cancelling gets gummed up so you might have to use some bluetac to clean them out.', 'Switched to Galaxy Buds Pro for a bit and regretted the change.  Had to buy a new set since my wife stole my originals.  Will always buy Airpods moving forward.', 'I have purchased several refurbished items from Amazon and have always had good luck.  However, these would not pair with any of the apple devices in our house.  I returned them.', 'Great quality, make sure you get them on sale ( I got mine for 169.99$ on prime day) the sound is amazing and Josie cancellation works very well for things like fans, engines, laundry, etc. but it doesn’t do so well with sudden sounds (ie voices or clapping) it just makes them quieter. Overall best set of earbuds I have ever owned, well worth the price if you get it on sale! 4.5/5 because battery life could be better', 'I do love them but they also have a drawback.  Prob my ears but none of the 3 gel fitting seem right for me.  They will fall out of your ears during workouts or work.  I purchased a magnet lanyard type thing that keeps em on my chest if they do come out.', 'This was a birthday gift for me son and he loved these. He has used the regular AirPods all the time for business and personal use. He is excited about the advanced features, especially being able to control them from his phone. And the noise reduction and battery life are great.', 'Apple brand , high quality! Great price on Amazon and they offered a extended warranty. I felt very safe buying them.  My wife loves them.', 'Extremely disappointed in these!! By far the worst Apple product I have ever bought!! Will not stay in my ears even when sitting completely still!! It doesn’t matter which size earpieces i use. My regular AirPods fit me perfectly and cost half as much. I bought these specifically for their noise canceling ability. But that feature is completely useless since they won’t stay in or sealed. Also you have to physically click a tiny button to control the AirPods which is hard to reach and ends up knocking them out of your ear.', 'Excellent earbuds. If price isn’t a factor just get these. Probably the number item on college / teens wish list if they don’t have a pair yet. Apple plans to make surround sound software upgrade soon. Battery life and replacement could be areas for improvement.', 'They worked half decent for a time. But slowly over time the digital distortion and glitches are making these completely unusable. Absolutely unacceptable for how much these things cost. Save your time and money and buy something that won’t have to be replaced in about one year.', 'Good: works seamless with all Apple gear!

I bought AirPod pro and serial number was right on the listing but when I opened my boxed there serial number was different. Its fake looks just like the real one.

These don't even hold charge.\", \"Only complaint about these is that I couldn't register them for Apple care via web. I had to call to confirm proof of purchase because the date couldn't be validated. Noise cancellation is good. These are more secure than the 1st gen airpods. I never liked the original Apple earbuds that came with an iPhone.\", 'I was a fool and bought into Senheizer hype. I spent $245 on earbuds that are just ok, and missed out not only on value but, also quality. Transparency mode on these buds is next level.', 'Get applecare for sure.

Good sound quality, features and integration with iOS. But they keep falling out of my ears. I tried all three ear tips sizes. And I ran the ear tip fit test which claims the medium are a good fit for my ear. they still keep falling out. I watched a couple reviews before buying. Great reviews, but none of them mentioned this issue. Once I started using them and encountered the issue, I did some research. There are a lot of reports on this issue on the Apple Support Community.  I am convinced it is not specific my my ear shape and size.', 'Great for music listening and talk. They have a good connection range. I leave my phone in the bedroom and walk in the house and in the patio and don’t loose signal. They are very comfortable to wear, I think Apple did a great job with this AirPods, they are just great', 'Alright, so I got these airpods because i wanted some wireless earphones.And over these earphones are great! They are $50 dollars off, they have noise cancellation, transparency mode, spatial mode, and a bit more. So overall if you don’t have any airpods right now and you wanna buy some, just get the pros,BUT if you already have the older airpods then just don’t upgrade. I only upgraded because i originally had no airpods. And if i’m being honest the sound quality is basically the same as the old airpods. There is a small difference on the sound but it isn’t too obvious.', 'For daily in and out of the house, doing tasks, and reading . . . the necessary re-pairing is a nuisance.

These headphones also do not fit in my ear well at all, even when I change the size of the silicon piece.\", 'Sound quality is amazing. It feels most comfortable in my ear with the middle sized tips. The noise cancellation is fairly decent for earbuds. I love how if you take out one of the AirPods out your ear the song automatically stops and when you put it back in your ear, it automatically starts playing again. The transparency is really good.

When you pop these in for the first time, the silence you hear (or don't hear?) is deafening.

Went back to my original apple buds.\", 'I received this 2 days early and was so happy. Genuine apple product, in the box. Works as expected and a great price. Super excited about this purchase.', \"Sound quality is alright and battery life has been as advertised so far at least. They don't stay in my ear sadly though so I had to order some ear hooks for them. I guess at the end of the day it really depends on your ear's shape\", 'I am so glad I got these!  I wanted them to use as a headset for work.  I converse on phone calls with no issues.  They allow me freedom to work on my computer or walk around without a phone in my hand.  With the advent of COVID, Video conference is more popular and I use them with my computer flawlessly. It took me a couple of tries to find the ear cushion best for me, but they are comfortable and stay in. I do not have a problem with charge either, but do not use them for music.', 'These are so amazing. During the winter , i accidentally dropped the left air pod in the snow and couldn’t find it for about 5 days . when i finally found it , it was in a clump of ice . after digging it out and warming it back up in a towel , i tested it and it still worked . it’s been months since then and it still works wonderfully . WOULDN’T RECOMMEND FREEZING ON PURPOSE JUST AS A PRECAUTION.', 'Noise cancellation is amazing.', 'Simply amazing. I’ve been waiting for these since I heard about them coming out. I skipped 1, 2, and finally got the Pros. Not disappointed at all with the sound quality. The bass is deep and well balanced and the connectivity is seamless. I only had one problem in which one AirPod wasn’t charging while the other was, so I’ll be monitoring that. But that’s about it. Of course I wish the battery lasted longer than 4 hours, but that’s just being nit picky. No regrets!', 'AirPod package opened, box dirty, case scratched. Very disappointed not Apple standard. No replacement prior to Christmas not in stock.', 'If you plan to use these just for runs, walking, studying, and low impact-- they are perfect! I have no complaints except for the fact that when I did my HIIT (burpees, jump rope) they slipped out of my ear. I would push them into my ear and then my inner ear would start to hurt (NOT good). For my short distance runs they were fine, but if I did longer distance and sweat ALOT, the sweat would impact how they stayed in my ear. I returned them and plan to get the wireless beats. Again, if you do not plan to use them for very high intensity stuff, they are very worth it! It made me sad to return them but I needed something more practical for my lifestyle!', \"The sound is great, the battery seems to last a while and the noise cancelation works well. The biggest draw back to these headphones is that they simply will not stay in my ears. I use these for working out and find myself picking them up off the ground more than I'm able to listen to my music. I previously had the original airpods and never had an issue with them, but since switching to the pro's they fall out of my ears every ten seconds.\", 'I was reluctant to try them because they seem trendy and overpriced but I genuinely don’t want to live my life without them. The ability to put on a podcast and put them in while I move around my house in leggings is unmatched', 'Not the best earbuds at this price especially sound quality, but Apple makes best products. Work very well with iPhones/iPads. Good sound quality and noise cancellation! This is the kind of products You won’t regret it. BTW, get the pro version, better fit your ear for most people I guess.', 'I love the pro besides one thing they don’t stay in my ear I tried all the extra ones that sent me and they still don’t stay in well I half to keep pushing them in but the loud music is the best', 'Not the best sounding ear buds I’ve had (Jabra Elites sound better) but the integration with IPhone makes life easier (battery % shows up on phone) Range is ok, they look sleek. Solid headphones but on the expensive side.', 'I like the sound quality! Battery is great for a Bluetooth AirPods! The noise cancellation is not the same as it is in a stereo style headset but it’s really great and make it easy to hear anything I want during my workouts! I love it.', 'Very uncomfortable silicone ear buds hurt ears. Absolutely no audio difference vs my 1st generation Airpods, in fact I think its worse, bass is flat. Very disappointed as my 4 year old Airpods are starting to wear out.', 'First pair of wireless AirPods and love them!!! Sounds is really good, the noise cancel or and transparency are excellent. Just buy them!!!!', 'I try to get outside to exercise everyday and I have to admit investing in the AirPods Pro is the best decision I have made in a long time. They are fantastic. The sound quality is top notch. And they don’t fall out!', 'Apple made the claim that the new AirPods will not fall out of your ears. This however was not my experience. I have tried all the tip sizes, and I can not get them to stay securely in my ears. They also broke within a month of me purchasing them. The right AirPod stopped to connecting to my phone of the case. I went to the Apple store and after taking a stern tone with the employee I convinced them to replace the broken AirPod. I then had to make a second trip to the Apple store for them to sync the AirPods again. That being said, they do have very good noise cancelation, and fairly decent sound quality.', 'Ordered these as a gift, after comparing with a different model. So glad I invested the extra money and splurged on these! Great sound quality, fit, and noise cancellation! Currently used for business, fitness, and pleasure, and I suspect will be used for a long time!', 'The regular AirPod kept falling out of my ears. I ordered these thinking they’d fit better because the ear piece comes in 3 sizes. They cost a lot more, but they still fall out my ears easily AND these have a shorter battery life! :(((', \"Replaced some cheap-o Jaybirds and there's no comparison. No more dangly wire and losing ear pieces anymore, these stay in ear fit and snug even during my full speed sprints. Audio quality is also a huge step up. Never going back.\", 'As we all know, this product is amazing, and so is apples warranty, this is my second pair and I absolutely love both of them. Recommended if you have the money to spare, if not their are other brands that are relatively good.', 'Called apple support and was on phone for over 2 hours and no luck. Works with all other devices but not the Surface. Stay clear as all online forums state they work with all bluetooth devices but dont.', 'most likely due to fit the noise cancellation did not work at all really was very disappointed these did not fit or work well.', 'I am very impressed with the sound quality and battery life. I wasn’t expecting to be so amazing. I was a little hesitant to get them but is money well spent.', 'i love how small and portable they are, all while lasting a long time with one charge. the noise cancellation is great but if i really try to i can still hear outside noises, but with audio on it never disrupted me. transparency mode was way more useful than i originally thought it would be and actually ended up being used more often than noise cancellation. quite a bit i forget i have them in and often fall asleep with them. they’re very easy to use and my favorite so far.', 'I bought these to replace my older AirPods that just broke. They’re better than original AirPods by leaps and bounds in sound and ear fit. Noise cancellation is very good and the passive noise mode is amazing. I love the AirPod Pros and am happy I bought them.', 'Loving my AirPods Pro but...Apple doing their normal messing about with charging cable.  Lightening one end USB-C the other. 🙄 so not accessible with regular USB block chargers, which btw, it doesn’t come with!', 'I used it at work on my lunch break catching up on my shows. I love the noise cancelling it blocks almost everything. The sound is great.', \"I mean it's an apple product. It works fine with my iPhone 11 but the volume is way too low on my Samsung Note 10. Another thing that just blows me away is how rich the base is when you have the noise cancelation. The one downside I have is that if you do intense workouts, your sweat will make the airpods fall off which personally didn't happen for me with the gen 1 or 2.\", 'A year later and they still work amazingly, BUT I’ve noticed that they have been running put of battery quickly, but then again, I do use them for long hours everyday... The sound quality is great along with the noise canceling ability. Definitely worth saving up for BUT there are other products with similar features that run for a lower price point.', 'The sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is so much better than I expected. They fit really well and the charge lasts long enough for my use. I use them pretty casually for calls, watching videos, and listening to music at the gym and they’re great for all of it. The best part is that they don’t budge while I’m on a run.', 'Love the sound quality, noise cancellation. While using with calls, have found in more than a few instances where the sync is lost while on a phone call. This occurs even while WiFi and other Bluetooth devices remain connected. We have one other pair in our home and similar instances, even in locations outside the home. We also have Bose earphone sets and the non-pro version EarPods and do not experience this issue.', \"I really loved these headphones. I really didn't want to spend the money on them because the normal apple headphones always hurt my ears so I wasnt sure if these would work, and I've always had a problem trying to get ear buds to stay in my ears, but these are perfect. I haven't had any issues with these  and love them a lot.\", 'Use these whenever I go running. They work good enough. Only four stars because they could be better. Had wired headphones in the past that sounded much better and did a better job of noise cancellation but considering these are wireless they do a pretty good job.', 'Good Airpods, I was nervous after seeing a bunch of people say these were fake, but don’t listen to them These came in five days early for me, I’ve received everything it was supposed to include and the airpods work great, completely new My only two complaints are how hard it is to change ear sizes, its a lot harder than they make it look And it does not come with a USB charger, it comes with a lightning cable instead, so unless you have an iPhone 11 Pro Charger box, the cord is virtually useless and I have to use my regular phone charger to charge the Box Otherwise I am very happy with my purchase!! Highly recommend these', 'These sound great. Bass is really good, I’d say as good as any of my Beats in ear and over ear sets. Love the size, they look even smaller than the original AirPods once you put them in your ear. They fit really well and sound quality for phone calls is great as well. These are my first “noise canceling” headphones so I can’t compare to others but I can totally tell the difference when you turn the noise canceling on and off. I have the 2nd gen original AirPods and PowerBeats3, I was very happy with both but I would definitely pick the AirPods Pro over both.', \"Best pair of headphones I've ever owned. Absolutely LOVE the active noise cancelation and the transparency mode. So dope. Although I wish they had the dual connectivity feature where I could simultaneously switch between my laptop PC and my iPhone\", 'It does not come with the cord that you connect to the adapter, I just received the adapter now I have to figure out what cord I need to buy. Not worth my time', 'After a year, they started getting crackling noises, then they would cut out and get disconnected from the phone randomly. Getting ready to buy another pair in October and I’ll definitely get Apple Care', 'Apple killed it with these AirPods. The sound quality is spectacular, the fit is super comfortable. Don’t hesitate because of the cost, worth every penny.', 'I feel like all of these are refurbished. I am now returning my second pair. I depend on these for work and have had multiple people not even be able to have a conversation with me due to the extreme background noise. I actually left a voicemail and listened to it to see what it sounded like and the quality was awful. As expensive as these are they are an absolute disappointment. I will be attempting to buy these one last time directly through Apple to see if there is a difference. Really wanted to like these but feel like it was a total gimmick.', 'Aw man the sound cancellation actually works it’s pretty cool! I love these I like to go out to eat and drink and watch Hulu on my phone so I use these to hear the movie without others hearing it. And the best part you can’t hear them👍🏻', 'Battery life improved over AirPods; Noise Cancelling works well, but obviously not as good as over-the-ear headphones; good product. However, lesser expensive models of competing brands are a better value.', 'The design of these airpods is bulkier, much bulkier, making them extremely uncomfortable in some ears. After just a short time I had to return and buy the original airpods because my right ear began to blister from irritation. So, great quality, just watch the fit.0', 'I am absolutely glad that I bought these AirPod Pros. The sound quality is superb. The battery life is alright. I feel like my original AirPod case kept a charge longer. But overall, I am pleased with this purchase!', 'Sound quality is awesome and noise cancelling feature is crazy. The only reason I didn’t give these 5 stars is because the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone can be sketchy when I’m answering or making phone calls. There are times they say they are connected but I cannot hear anything. In these cases I have to hang up the call. Put the headphones back in the cases and try again. It’s been a little bit of a pain when trying to conduct client calls.', 'I LOVE these Apple AirPods Pro!! Great sound and noise cancellation lives up to the hype. The added convenience of wirelessly charging on the Qi charger in my car is a real plus. Absolutely worth my money.', 'Tiene la calidad esperada para productos Apple. Calidad de sonido superior a otros audífono. Se conecta con mi mac book pro, el iPad 7a generación y mi iPhone 12 pro sin ningún problema con conexión Bluetooth.', 'I wanted to like these, but they put pressure on the inside of my ear and would hurt after 15 minutes so I found myself reverting back to my original airpods more often. The noise canceling and actual sound is excellent, but just couldn’t keep them due to being uncomfortable in my ears.', 'An avid headphone guy, I have hesitated to buy Apple AirPods just because.... I have purchased Beats, Jbl, and skull candy before. All have had issues with staying charged or shorting out. I can honestly say like many others, this is the best investment for headphones and the fit incredibly in the ear even for running. Features are amazing and function appropriately.', 'Love love love these. They are perfect. They go off just by removing them from your ears. They reduce exterior sounds just by adjusting them on your phone. Cannot say enough about them.', 'Everything is great except I cannot get the pods to fit in my right ear, no matter the size. It’s frustrating but it’s just my ear and not the products fault. It can’t fit everyone’s ear 100%.', 'I really like how comfortable they are in the ears. My previous pair made my ears cry! The call quality is also really good and I enjoy the wireless charging feature. Things I hate about them are the battery capacity and how they attract dust! As you can see in the picture, gotta constantly keep cleaning them.', 'Worked great until a firmware update caused them to randomly stop working every 5 minutes or so with my windows PC. In some cases this resolves by switching ears in mono mode. In other cases they switch to my phone but stay connected to the PC (audio stops though). Has completely broken my WFH setup in the middle of the workday. Note that airpods update without warning and there is no rollback.', 'I can not get this product to work properly.  The right headphone will not produce sound. The controls work on it though.  If I turn off the noise canceling feature a horrible static noise is produced at maximum volume, which really causes some discomfort.  I have attempted every trouble shooting method multiple times with no success.  I am very disappointed with this product.  I do not feel a product at this price range should have such poor quality.', \"ordered twice and received damaged and used ones , that not right because I paid a premium price for a high quality product and I don't deserve to receive used and damaged products, and I ignored previous reviews about other customers experiencing the same issue , I expect higher standards from a company like Amazon.\", 'If you have small ear canals then you know how the ear buds and Air Pods can hurt and not feel comfortable.  These are great!  I would order them again without hesitation.', \"Comfortable, Easy to use, good enough and natural noise cancellation, a not hi-end, but 'correct' and relax sound. Good enough battery life, best in class connection and latency. It is truly the all rounder true wireless headphones in the market right now. For both ios and android\", 'I bought this for my wife. She is using the medium size buds which fits her ears just fine. It takes a little bit of getting used to, since it is a new generation of Apple AirPods with different functions.', \"So at first I was just a little skeptic because I was ordering on Amazon and that I saw just a few reviews saying that they were used before opening the box. BUT my airpods were 100% brand new, no scratches, dents, or ear wax, and they are real and not some clone. (I had to watch a few YT videos to see if they were real 😂) ANYWAYS...the sound quality and noise cancellation were great. But before you buy these, make sure fit becuase I know theres some people that love these AirPods but they don't fit in their ears. If you have the money you should totally get them!\", 'This was a gift for my granddaughter in Australia. I spoke with her today and she told me the AirPods were awesome. I guess that qualifies it for 5 stars.', 'I loved the simplicity and quality build. But the sound quality for music is not as premium as some others like beolit. The battery is also not great but gets me through the day one ear at a time', 'The sound was great but the comfort was zero. These are the only ear buds that I was completely satisfied with as far as sound, noise, etc but unfortunately they were so uncomfortable that I had to return. My ears still have not recovered!', 'Though I love the noise cancellation of these earbuds I have to admit they fall out of my ears easily and that they require charging a lot more often than my AirPods did before I got the AirPods Pro.', 'As a business road warrior, it was so hard to have a conversation with my original airbuds due to road noise.  The Airbuds Pro eliminate ALL road noise and makes it possible to hear everything being said without asking someone to repeat.', 'Will hang up on calls if you push them back into your ear. UPDATE: 5/27/2021.  I absolutely HATE these things.  MORE time than not the right earpiece does not work so you have to jiggle it, recharge it, cross your fingers...', 'I bought those in May. In the beginning, I had to tolerate important discomforts with it: falling from my ears (in all three sizes), having one of the two pods that discharges faster (on the right side), and having a really hard time using it with Teams on my PC computer. Now, after using it in several meetings and not understanding what could be wrong, I found out the other side cannot hear me well! A friend just told me the I \"sound like if I were underwater\". I would go for better technology, next time.', 'They pair very easily but that about as much as I like about them. The sound quality for the price is bad. The fall out you eat much easier than the last generation. And the battery life is pretty short I was having to constantly recharge them.', 'Unbelievable how well they work. Noise cancellation is great. Who wants to hear someone else conversation while working out.  Got a break on price during Prime days', 'These kind of make old AirPods seem like straight garbáge. The noise cancelling is good (not TOTAL noise cancelling - like I think it\\'s perfect, but if someone wanted to be completely deaf to the outside world, they might be a little disappointed). As Ferris Bueller said, \"If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.\"', \"The absolute best earbuds I've ever owned. Completely worth the price. I wanted to get the older version of the airpods but I guess my ears are shaped weirdly?? Hahaha they are always falling out! So when Apple came out with the pros I was super excited. No matter what I'm doing, they stay snug in there and the sound quality is so amazing for something so tiny. Also being able to switch between transparency mode and sound cancelling is definitely a key feature.\", \"Amazing wireless earbuds overall the experience is 10x better if you're using them on Apple products I prefer Android still they work well but they do have little hiccups here and there that can be annoying for example connection issues sometimes the sound can be echoey but all you need to do is disconnect and connect them again and this should fix that problem. I've encountered an issue where they would connect but as soon as they would it would freeze my video or sound would not play all you need to do to fix this is reset them and that should fix it I wish the battery life these\", 'Do you think is good about the easier process is a Noise cancellation the battery life sucks and I still fall out of my ear I would not recommend it to any more friends or family or anyone because of the high price when I go running in the fall out of my ear', 'I got these on Black Friday and LOVE them. I use them almost daily. They are WAY better than the regular AirPods I have and make my ears hurt less! Love the sound canceling feature as well! Loveeeee. Good product and good quality, easy to pair with devices and switch between them and use.', 'I couldn’t understand why these were so special but now I get it. I still think it’s a lot of money. I bought a pair for my hubby and they work great with his Note10', \"I can't believe the quality of the noise cancellation on these! It is really good. I've used them for exercising and I can barely hear cars when they pass by. I was very happily surprised with this feature. Sound quality is also superb. Better than the old headphones I was using. Highly recommend. They're pricey but worth it IMO as long as they hold up over time and I don't have to replace them often.\", 'This was perfectly done...great quality and great sound the noise cancellation works well and its a good headset', 'I have small ears and the small buds always make them fall out . Noise cancellation is cool sounds quality is less than stellar . I don’t like how I can’t turn them off because otherwise they just drain and that’s frustrating. The fact that they connect when I don’t want them to can get annoying too', 'Air Pods Pro overall is an amazing product, my only gripes was it had a weird stutter with the audio. It seem all I had to do is reset my network settings, Battery life for it is like 4-5 hours with noise cancellation but charged in like an hour, while my old earbuds would last 7 hours would take a few hours to charge. It also took a minute for them to get comfortable in my ear. Finally if you are getting these for anything but a apple product I reconsider seeing it instantly paired with my iPhone, and all the settings with in the air pods.', 'I just bought it item, and the battery life is horrible!  I am lucky if I can listen to an audiobook at a low sound level for three hours!', 'I was concerned, based on other reviews, the AirPods Pro wouldn’t stay in my ears while doing workouts at the gym.  However, I have not had any issues while I’m on the treadmill, lifting weights or doing floor exercises.  Another superb Apple product.', 'Pretty good so far! I only wish they wouldn’t fall out if my ears I have the beats pro and I never had a problem with those but these seem to fall out every 20 minutes or so. The noise cancelling is great I can’t hear a thing when music is playing and the audio is nice and loud and crisp.', 'Great product. My first wireless EarPods, and it really helps not to have any wires to deal with. The noise canceling is great, and I especially like that you can flip between noise canceling and transparent, so you can hear things around you without taking them out. Also, works effortlessly with my iPhone.', 'Like that the stems are smaller than the original airpod so it’s not looking like a weird white thing sticking out your ear. Sound is good, but the rubber plug doesn’t always hold great - my first run one fell off despite the rubber being the right fit according to the setup :(', 'Unboxed these and connect to my iPhone used them for 2 Days. On the third Day the left ear would not stay connected. So I charged them and same thing happened.  I contacted apple and they said because we brought them on Amazon they will not help us. Trashed the box so now know one will help us.', 'Amazing headphones. Especially with the atmos sound. Only complaint is ear fit. If they fit properly in your ear best ever. If you have trouble with ear fit the standard air pods are a great alternative.', \"I bought this for my dad on Father's day, and he absolutely loves them. Uses them every day and they are easy to pair. He appreciates the sound suppression and transparency mode as an upgrade from his last air pods I bought for him the other time.\", \"I purchased the pro version for my teenage son for Christmas. He had a regular pair of airpods that he used all the time. The pro model wouldn't stay in his ears. The additional ear-piece just was too bulky so they kept falling out. For a $200 investment I wasn't willing to have them worn a couple of times and then lost on the ground somewhere. Might be great sound but the design doesn't work for everyone's ear so worth considering before purchase.\", 'I truly wish I hadn’t wasted my money on these.  If you’re on the fence, don’t spend money on something that can’t fit without pain to your ear…', 'Bought these once before and I managed to drop and immediately step on one of them, but they are so good I have no regrets with buying another pair. Nothing I have tried before these comes close to having the same sound quality. The bass in these hits like no other. The noise cancellation is all but flawless. My only complaint is that they don’t last me my full 9 hour work day, but put them in the case to charge while I’m on lunch and that half hour of charge usually manages to get me through.', \"Will return this. Can't believe that it doesn't fit my right ear. It even hurts to have them in. One would think that Apple had some R&D money to find out a better fit. My right ear hurts and it falls out too easily. Will buy the Jabra instead, hopefully better luck. In addition, the battery life is like with all Apples products very disappointing. No change. Connectivity to my iPhone was seamless though. Really liked how easy it was to just plug the pods in without having to pair with the phone. But still, can't have earbuds that hurts\", \"I had a pair of Gen 1 AirPods I was very happy with until I lost them. I bought these as a replacement, and have loved them. The noise cancelling helps uncover so much sonic clarity, and it's clear the drivers here have been upgraded. I also appreciate the passive noice cancelling and fit of the silicon tips. A few days ago I found my old AirPods but have decided to keep these as I love them so much. I got them on sale for $200 and would wait until there is another comparable deal\", 'This was a gift from my husband & I’m very happy with them. I have small ears & most Bluetooth earbuds are too big. I love the ability to adjust the size of these, they are comfortable. The sound quality & noise cancellation is very good. They arrived quickly and packaged appropriately.', 'Everything about these AirPods are as advertised in my opinion. They’re NOT fake BTW, so you can rest assured you’re getting the real deal from Amazon. ***Not sure why some have posted they are fake. Lol, maybe they’re fake!*** At any rate I’ve put off buying ANY Apple earbud due the fact they just don’t fit my ears well... these fit great!  I also really enjoy not having any wires between them, super cool! Way to go Apple!!! It’s about damn time too!!! I will say they’re not a substitute for a good over-ear headphone but a great second choice. So not reference quality sound but really very nice. Enjoy! ;)', 'They are my best friend I don’t know how I lived without them . Great to listen to my music when walking. 3 earplugs let’s you get the best fit for your ears.', 'New review: I really liked them until one ear bud stopped working. I do know what’s wrong and I’m outside warranty period now. Stay away! Old review:Like everything about it. You can use it for long hours without noticing it. Improved designed over the original AirPod is great. Only con is they should be available is multiple colors not just white', 'I love the noise cancelation and then the sound as it helps to not hear my wife while we are both working from home. The sounds is very good on these as well and like the spatial audio take sounds to a different level.', 'This is the most expensive headphone/earphone I have bought. My previous one is a Bose Sound Sports Wireless earphone. The apple air pods pro feels such a major upgrade. Feels so premium. The noise cancellation is pretty great. And doesn’t fall off my ears when while running around. Great product by Apple!', 'The AirPod sound quality is amazing, very clear. There is a downside to them, there are a bunch of issues with getting them to actually work. A lot of static and random buzzing and it feels like they are plugged up. I use these when I run and workout so it might be sweat that got into them but overall they are somewhat decent.', 'The AirPods pro live up to the hype. The sound quality is solid, offering decent separation and a full range sound. There are some better sounding options out there in the price range though. The noise canceling is where these really shine. They keep up with my Bose QC35s which was a pleasant surprise. Battery life is pretty normal for these guys, and as with all Apple products they are simple to set up and use.', \"A must have if you're in the Apple ecosystem. Syncs seamlessly to my iPhone X and AW5. Sound is fantastic, and the ANC is game-changing. Be aware the fit and comfort is different from original Airpods. They took a bit to get use to, but I love the new design, sound, and new features of this model.\", 'I bought these after i saw they were way cheaper on here than at the apple store. They arrived the next day after ordering and i am satisfied with my purchase. The one thing that bothers me is the lack of ear tips that fit in my ears. They seem to fall out after a while of being in my ears. Theyre not uncomfortable and i can barely even feel them in my ears. I would recommend using different ear tip sizes for each ear.', 'Air pods wouldn’t charge. Still no refund and it’s been over 2 months', 'Phone calls very clear, use it on my Mac meetings sound great. Music sounds so clear and I like that they are smaller and noise canceling great.', 'These headphones are super high quality I would only recommend these to who has some cash to spare. These stay in my ears not like the other EarPods!', 'it was probably just the pair I ordered, but there was definitely something wrong with these. they wouldnt always connect right away, the noise cancellation was not great, and the sound quality was worse than expected. also i was sketched out because there was a week long delay on the shipping... very strange for a prime product. anyways, i returned these and bought the same pair at best buy and my new airpods are much better.', \"For the amount of money spent on this product, you would think the case would be more sturdy. This is my second time returning it-  and I am returning it again for a replacement. The case falls apart so easily. It's supposed to be on my person at all times, but it just can't hold up to that.\", 'If you have issues with any ear buds falling out these are no different. At this price point they should come with foam options. Sent back because I refuse to spend more money on top of purchase price for foam tips. They do sound amazing when they are actually secure in your ear.', 'They tend to slip out of my ear....I find myself pushing it in throughout the day so that it won’t get lost. What I do like about them is the fact that the battery life is great & the sound quality is good. The noise cancellation is great as well.', 'This product does not connect like the air pods 1. I bought it less then 2 months ago and have had major connection issues. I spoke to apple about the product and they said send it back and we will send you a new one. They asked to hold my credit card information in case they send me a new one without me sending the old one back. Turns out they charged me for diagnosis and did not actually fix my product. I blame apple and i also blame amazon for not helping me resolve this matter.', 'They were great for about 3 months and then the noise cancelling stopped working. I switch the AirPods to noise cancellation mode but nothing happens, I can still hear everything around me as if it was just in Off mode. I expected more from a $250 product.', 'Sounds Great, pairs you just fine however only ten days after buying them right ear phone had a power failure (According to the Apple tech) and now having to wait for them to be sent back to Apple to be fixed or replaced…', 'These meet or exceed all features of wireless headphones!  Well worth the extra cost!  I am very happy I chose Apple’s Air Pod Pros!  It’s tough to beat Apple Products!', 'The battery is not lasting as close as long as promised. You will be charging these 2-4 times during a workday.  These headphones usually connect very easily to my phone after set up. Set up was a breeze and did not take very long. The range on these headphones allows me to keep my phone in one place and I can walk around my entire house.', 'Big fan of the noise cancellation. I can hear important and specific noises, but the buzz of normal air and “static” is silenced. Definitely an upgrade from the regular AirPods.', 'I love these earbuds but I have to issues. The hindge on the back is a little loose, but I still feel comfortable opening and closing it many times. Also there is a bit of scratching on the S and Z sounds. The louder the volume, the more you hear it. But overall the earbuds are amazing.', 'Better ear customization and noise cancellation set the AirPods Pro above the original. Ease of setup with Apple devices is not new, but a nice feature. The sound quality is not as good as Bose or Beats, but it is perfect for calls and podcasts. I’m happy with this purchase.', 'Absolute garbage. I had a pair before these and they worked fine. This new pair that I bought on July 22nd won’t hold a charge and I have to manually pair it to my phone. Which shouldn’t happen because I have the auto pair turned on. I wish I could return them but I can’t because I don’t have all the packaging. Might as well throw them away. Worst item I’ve ever bought', 'I gave these Apple AirPods five stars because they word as well or better than the reviews described. The only limitation is that the case is slippery and the pods are awkward to take in and out of the case. I had to watch a video right at first to see how to do this.', \"To claim that these are noise cancelling is inaccurate at best.  The outside noise is slightly diminished, but by no means cancelled.  I bought them for the gym and, no, they do not cancel the noise, but barely diminish it while I listen to my own music.  Very disappointing.  Now I wouldn't be comfortable purchasing the headphones as they could possibly be misrepresenting the noise-cancelling feature.\", 'These worked fine for about 3 months then the case stopped charging the air pods. I plug it in and the light goes off after six seconds and they don’t charge.', 'I own a pair of AirPods, which are great, but I decided to upgrade to the pro version. Pricey but well worth it. Being able to toggle back and forth between transparency mode and noise cancellation mode is what make theses headphones ideal. There is a huge difference between the two! I am very pleased with this purchase!!', 'These are worth every penny. I hate spending money on pretty much anything, but I’m glad I made this purchase. If you are on the fence, jump over and add to your cart.', 'Was extremely disappointed. Upon opening the case ear wax was all inside the fitted ear pieces. Was willing to clean and move forward from that disappointing moment. To my dismay also found that the case would not charge. It was very obvious that the device was not properly inspected before resale.', 'Case opens easily I have been lucky to notice , otherwise I would have lost them. I have Tried all Ear suctions all fall out of my ears easily.  All say good fit.  Not true.', 'Amazing! Yes they are gimmicky and they are from apple and cost a lot. But it’s all worth it if your going to use them all the time, which I do. And they are great for people that fly often. The noise cancelling is really good. Shuts up all the crying babies and cabin noise. I downloaded a rain and thunder song To my phone and was able to relax and sleep with no problem.', 'Super convenient and comfortable. Left one always falls out when I move my face or jaw, might be the tip but I’ve tried all three with no luck. ANC and pass through Are great, but after a fall they seem to be less effective. Don’t get me wrong it’s very impressive that they basically fixed themselves, the right earbud had crackling after the fall and it seems like the ANC compensates for it. I love them, I use them all the time. Currently they are my daily drivers, but there are some, issues as is usually with Apple', 'I like that it has both noise cancellation and transparency mode to boost noises around you when you need to hear your surrounding. The ear piece is made of silicon though instead of rubber so sometimes they slip out of my ears.', \"I think this is a good product. But mines comes with some problems. Sometimes I pause with the physical click on one airpod and when I unpause only one of the airpods continue to play. I have to take off the airpods or even to disconnect the airpods so everything is back to normal. I don't thinks this is normal.\", 'Bought these as a Christmas gift for my son.  He asked and I purchased and shipped them to him.  So far he hasn’t complained once and says they have great quality of sound.  My only complaint, when he wears them I hear every thing he does.  From wind when he is outside to every conversation around him.  He did say they hold a lengthy charge.', 'Noise cancellation did not work even though the function was active on the phone. Returned and got one straight from the Apple Store', \"These sound great and with the case battery and integration with the iphone, they're really nice. Comfy too. Wish they were out when I got my Bose over-the-ear headphones with the cord....\", 'This is very efficient to cancel the noise from outside. I wear them when sleep because my husband snores too loud. It helps me to sleep. I wear them when I go to gym. It is a good product.', 'I bought these AirPods in October for my grandson and he reports that the charging case is not charging anymore', 'Without even running or walking, these things slip out of my ear. It’s horrible. I would assume they were knock off because I haven’t seen Apple make a project this bad ever.', 'Lightweight with great sound. Former Jabra user who got tired of sound mysteriously dropping out completely in one ear, and suddenly fluctuating volume. Would prefer these even when Jabra works properly.', \"I use the airpods with a Samsung galaxy and either the sound and noise cancelation works perfectly, also I tried in an apple product and is the same think. The only bad thing is that doesn't come with the apple sticker. But the rest is perfect!👌\", 'Sound is amazing! Easy to use, married to phone.  Comfortable!  Only down side pods battery lasts about 3hour. Charges very fast. You can also charge in case if away from plug.  They stay put. Don’t worry about falling out of your ears. Thanks Apple.👍', 'Great for Mfg expensive for the buyers. Bought 2 sets last 60 day’s because they are not secure in the ear when u discover gone they’re gone and have to buy again. Time to buy nock off 1/10 price. Apple secure or u loser', 'I am so spoiled with these new wireless earbuds.  They fit me! I was concerned about them falling out and loosing one.  The fit great and the sound is fabulous.  I won’t go back to my old apple earbuds.', 'Much better than old AirPods, lasts longer (for now). I had to get a pair replaced as the sound was patchy - apparently Apple issued a recall for late 2020 models. Anyway, seems to be better', 'The AirPods I received were definitely not brand new. The tape to seal the box shut was cut and the inside of the box is dirty. Returning immediately and purchasing directly from Apple', \"I bought these May 5th and on June 14th the right earbud stopped working...it has a tick tick sound and comes and goes. You also have to charge them way more often than other headphone brands. I honestly think there are many better wireless headphones available. I was a sucker for the brand and wish I rather looked into the quality and functionalities. E.g., these headphones don't have a volume button on the headphones themselves which can be annoying if you use them for biking / running.\", 'Have liked everything so far. I’m sure there’s more I can do with them, but sound quality is great, battery life seems to last forever but I don’t have them in all day. I’m very happy with purchase', 'I bought AirPod pros to have noise cancelling earbuds for work calls since I work from home and there’s a lot of surrounding noise. Unfortunately I had to return them because AirPods are not supported by Microsoft teams. They completely don’t work, no sound and no mic. So stupid. If they worked with Teams I would’ve kept them.', 'Had PowerBeats2 before which were great but had a really bad mic for calls. These are awesome for calls and pick up far less background noise. Would rather stick with the PowerBeats for working out though, but have transitioned to using the AirPods for every other use case.', 'Does not fit. I’ve tried to size the three different buds and I cannot get a good seal. I also hate that it’s so difficult to charge them. I can’t stand these, I’ll shopping for beats or Bose wireless headphones.', 'Short prong and poorly designed. Earpiece is loose and does not stay in ear canal. Sound quality is very distorted . Expensive and worthless .', \"Like to because it is so compact and functional, especially when I travel on the plane.  Don't have the big headphone anymore.  Overall, it is a good product.\", \"I've used this product but have developed an allergy to the latex rubber on the tip of the AirPods ear piece.  This has resulted in swollen ear canals and loss of hearing.  Finally I'm recovering but will never use this product again.\", 'No complaints here. Noise cancellation works great. Even the sound from a hair blow dryer is very faint and music is clear. The conversation mode is magic. Very compact and super easy to use. Especially if you are an Apple user.', 'My DIL was telling me how great these are so I decided to buy a pair during PRIME Days and I love them!!!  Great sound quality and I have no problem with battery life.', 'Though they sound great for in ear headphones, they constantly fall out of my ear when talking or after a period of time. I have small ears so I attribute this to the issue. I would not buy this model again and think the original AirPod design are much more comfortable.', 'I guess I’m still shocked at the noise cancelling and then ability to hear around you (amplified). I can use these when running and still be safe which makes these a great investment for me as both a runner and someone that travels.', 'Everything is pretty much perfect, but the left ear doesn’t seem to want to fit well. My right ear is fine and I can practically forget that it’s in my ear, but my left ear was having trouble. I found a slightly perfect angle to put the earbud in, but it’s annoying and very disappointing that it doesn’t fit well, considering the price. I’ve read that it’s an ongoing issue for many people. I’ll have to update if it doesn’t get any better or if anything else happens.', 'Bought two pair of airpod pros. When they did work, we were constantly pushing them back in.(no matter what ear piece size we put on) One pair began crackling and lost sound in first 4 months. Apple support helped me “fix” them. Other pair quit connecting to the iphone after 8 months(15 times using them). After 1.5hrs of apple trouble shooting, they send me a box to send them the airpods to Apple to “look” at them. Going on one week and still nothing from them. Save your money buy Beats.', 'My first pair I bought 1 1/2 years ago became very staticky. Heard that was a first run problem so bought these to give Apple one more shot.', 'Been an Apple fan for over 20 years with over 50 Apple products purchased, and this AirPods Pro was the only product I felt disappointed. The regular version of the AirPods have much higher overall quality than the Pro version IMO.', 'I love that I could purchase my AirPods on Amazon for a low price then the Apple website. Awesome delivery time, I received the AirPods on the same day that I had ordered them! Great sound quality and I love the noise cancellation feature. My AirPods have worked perfectly since day one. I would recommend these to a friend.', 'Dislike that none of the top options fit my ears. My second time buying them because of the noise cancellation. Returned first time due to being a bad fit. Kept falling out. It’s happening again :/', 'Wasted money on a few lower priced knockoffs thinking that these were just overpriced because they were an Apple product. I was wrong!! Sound quality is the best of all but, the Apple extras are amazing. Great sound right out the box and easy setup. Highly recommend!!!', 'Apple is always a superb product. They sounded great, but I was always afraid they would fall out of my ear especially when riding my bike.  That would be an expensive loss!  I opted for an off brand that fit snugly in my ear at about 1/4 the price.', 'There was an issue with charging that exists on these pods - there is a fluctuating red exclamation that shows even after a long charge - i spoke to amazon  and they approved the original return - i went to apple the same day to exchange and they had 0 in stock - i then travelled so missed the return window - open returning i spoke to amazon again and they after a long time said they would return them - then i get hit with a $47 restocking fee !! What a disaster these EarPods are and what a disaster amazon and apple are for not accepting the fault and giving a full refund - shame !!', 'I found the pods uncomfortable when inserted for over an hour  I paired with TV and was surprised at the clarity relative to subpar internal speaker in TV', 'I have received cracked airpods. it is very unpleasant to pay 185 USD and get broken airpods. I have asked to Amazon and they rejected to refund or return back the product. I strongly believe that Apple sends problematics pods to Amazon with discounted price. I recommend you to purchase another product (JBL or Beats) , this one is really bad quality. that is why, there is a discount on the price.', 'They fall out of my ears constantly. I’ve tried using the different size pieces but it doesn’t matter. I’m returning them and getting the AirPods instead of the pro.', 'Can you spot the fake one? The originals sound 10x better, and it have features that the fake one dont have. I love the originals the sound is amazing they connect every time no problem. It detect your ear if you remove it from it. The fake ones it was such a pain to sync to my phone and most of the time one earbud would not play.', 'None of the sizes they come with fit my ears! They just pop right out, I can’t move my head too much or even smile while wearing them. Best fitting earbuds I’ve ever had are the beats earbuds... Those rubber pieces fit in my ears perfectly and do not fall out (and in my audiophile opinion the sound is better than the airpods). Gave these to my boyfriend and they somehow fit him fine. Now I’m off to buy wireless Beats earbuds.', \"The new spatial audio feature is pretty cool. As you move your head around while watching compatible videos, the headphones adjust to make it sound like the audio is always coming from the iPhone/iPad's direction. It's a trip.\", 'I bought these in November before Black Friday.  And paid $16 more.  But I got them in about 5 days.  Most people had to wait 2-3 weeks for delivery.  Anyway, I love them.  I have small ears and the feel much better than most ear buds.  Sound is better than most ear buds.  Would buy them again.', 'I got my air pod pros from the Amazon warehouse and what a great deal! I ordered 2 more pair for the kids! If you sleep next to a person who snores, you need these in your life!!', 'I really wanted to love these. The noise-canceling is awesome and the sound is great as well, but the shape of them did not work in my ears. They were very uncomfortable and fell out (no matter what size ear thingy was attached) during my workouts. Super bummed.', 'This blew me away. I’ve always been a Apple fan and I just love their sound signature. I was initially skeptical about moving away from wired setups but with the way the world moves now, it’s best to get into the wireless game before your left behind. This though was crazy good. Sound Quality is superb, it’s comfy, easy to use, and basically everything I was expecting and more!', 'Product does not stay put in my ears, regardless of which size rubber tip i use. Produces disconcerting buzzing when airtight seal in ear canal is lost. I am terrified I will lose one in a toilet.', 'These are Apple products. The ergonomics are are great and pairing with an iPhone is solid and effortless. The sound quality is very good but others in this price range are better. The battery life is about 3 hours of continuous use. Other earbuds have and all-day battery, but very few (if any) in this form factor.', 'I was debating back and forth to get these because let’s be honest, these are expensive but in the long run I got them and I’m VERY glad I did. The bass is amazing and the noise features are also great! Compared to my Samsung galaxy buds I used to have these are SO much better so I think the price is worth it!', 'I would have love to keep this headphones because the compatibility with the iPhone is seamless but I can’t get it to stay in my ear even after getting different ear tips they don’t work for me and my ear started to hurt.

The only thing I don’t like is how I can barley hear people talking to me even if it have it in cancellation mode.', \"I love everything about these airpods EXCEPT the fact that they won't stay in my ears!  I've tried all three earbud covers in my NORMAL size ears and none of them help keep the airpods from falling out.  I hate to write this review, however, if you are active (I run every day), I would caution this purchase.  I'm returning and buying a new pair of the original airpods (which I used for years, with never falling out of my ears!).\", 'I bought these for my daughter and she loves them!  They are compact and the sound quality is great!', \"The noise cancelation is the best that I've seen so far and the built quality is mostly durable but when dropped makes marks those marks doesnt affect the quality but it does make scratches to the case so if you dont like those its probably best to get a case with the airpods other than that I've litterly washed them in a washing machine once because it was in my pants without me knowing but they still were the same great quality from before I did that durability is amazing\", 'For all the great features, what’s the point of it goes flying out of your left ear when chewing a hot dog, or jettisons out your right ear when your girlfriend makes you laugh?', 'So everything like the sound quality and battery life was working pretty well but now when using the headphones for phone calls I can’t get people to hear me as they say “you sound very far from the phone” or like “I can’t hear anything you say” also when using one headphone it shows as like I’m using both and the battery is dying for the one I’m not using which can be very annoying I’m not sure if it can be fixed with an update from apple but I would like to get a trade or something please and thank you', 'I liked these but passed them on to my husband after first week and begged for my EarPods 2 back.

I’m a marathon runner and the battery last over 2 hours with just one charge.', \"A great product, hands down.

Got these for my girlfriend, for her Personal Training job, Working out and business calls all in one!! They are absolutely amazing quality. I'm so glad for buying the PROs due to the ear buds!!

I’ve not been able to test the noise cancellation very much (too lazy), but I have faith in Apple, so I may up that specific rating later on.', \"I've tried several brands of earbuds. When I wasn't constantly adjusting them in my ear canals, or chasing them across the floor, I was listening to average audio quality via sketchy Bluetooth connections. AirPods Pro, while at a premium price, deliver amazing noice cancelling, excellent sound quality and fit perfectly. I just hope they are very durable and long-lasting, because nearly $250 is a lot to pay more than once every few years.\", 'I used my AirPods all day every day. One of them started to get crackly but a nice Amazon customer service agent named Jenroe helped me find a solution to this issue by even calling Apple for me. Great work, team.', 'Great noise cancellation. Fantastic sound quality. Battery life could be better. They work on Android, though battery indicator is third party.', 'Worth every penny.

Best sound quality .', 'My air pods only last one charge (even when put back into the case). The charge does not last which makes them basically useless.', 'I love the sound from these and the noise canceling is phenomenal. However it is all for not without good fitting ear pieces.

They are the first wireless buds that actually stay put. The sound is amazing. I workout a lot so these are perfect. I’m glad i got the pros.', 'If you want a set of $250 headphones, get these.  If you truly can’t afford them, please don’t. At the end of the day, these are just headphones. Fancy, yes. Probably cost Apple $20 to make. Another note, these fall out while I install carpet.

It automatically connects to your bluetooth device. The best wireless earbuds on the market. I love them.', 'I bought these to replace my broken Beats Studio 3’s, and I HIGHLY recommend these. I also had the original AirPods but sold them and loved those. If you loved the original AirPods, then chances are you’ll love these even more. In my using experience, the noise cancelling is on par with the Beats Studio 3’s that I have, except the AirPods Pro are much much more convenient to use.', 'These are expensive so it’s disappointing that they keep falling out, no matter which of the three different heads that I have tried.', 'I bought 3 of these for family members and 2 out of 3 loved them. However for one they just simply didn’t fit the ears enough to stay in. Personally, I Love the quality and ease of use. I recommend buying a case. If you drop them they will likely fly out and you could lose them. I bought that locks.', 'To be completely honest, I bought these for the sole purpose of a better ASMR experience. I definitely hear a difference in quality from the old airpods and can say that the noise cancelling further heightens the experience. However, even with noise cancellation on, I wish that they could cancel out any sounds entirely instead of merely wind.', 'The sound quality is better than expected.  The noise cancelling and transparency modes are amazing as well.  Fits great, and the battery lasts about 4 1/2 to 5 hours.  Much better than I ever expected.', 'Los AirPods son excelentes accesorios para tus equipos Apple, sin embargo no son los mejores audífonos para escuchar música por qué su calidad no es de las mejores.

I replaced my beats solos for these. I use them at the gym and now ...wherever I can. (Beats solos too bulky) I love these!

It is not pricey....it is reasonable for the quality we get from apple.', 'While air pod pro has superior noise cancellation with high sound quality.  AirPods slowly creep out of your ears until you can barely hear the audio. Then, unless you catch them in the nick of time, they fall out. Apple needs to redesign the silicone tips with a different shape or as foam so they stay in your ears.', 'I bought this one because other apple headphones hurt my ears so this solves that problem. They don’t fall out when working out too! The noise cancellation is awesome! When at the gym I don’t hear anything around me.

Only drawback, they loosen when I laugh or chew and I have to readjust.', \"When I received the Air Pods Pro I was very disappointed to find out the charging cord is a proprietary cord i.e. not compatible with a USB port or plug.  This is typical Apple, making you purchase something you shouldn't need.  My wife sent gave these as a gift that I now have to return because they are useless without having the correct / proprietary plug or adapter to charge the ear pods.  This is very disappointing.

All I got to say is I deeply regret selling my AirPods Pro from the beginning.', 'I’ve been wanting these for awhile. Im going to keep it nice & simple. They’re everything you would expect. Comfortable, easy to put on. Especially with the new iOS 14 update. The spatial audio with Dolby with Apple TV Js amazing. Love these & very happy with my purchase. With Amazon’s quick speedy delivery I was very much satisfied. Definitely recommend.', 'Hello. Welcome to over paying for a product because it says “Apple” on it. I did it. And thousands of others have too. Don’t get me wrong I love these and they are top of the line headphones; however, Apple over charges for these by like $150. If you have extra money to burn(maybe because a recently obtained stimulus check) go for it! If you don’t have too much extra laying around, do not buy. It’s not worth $250', \"I LOVE these!! I really was skeptical, but I'm pleasantly surprised.  The noise cancelling feature is unbelievable and the battery seems to last forever. The fit in my ear is even comfortable!\", 'I had the second gen AirPods and I loved them but they just never stayed in my ears. So I decided to upgrade to the pros and I do not regret it! They stay in my ears and are so comfy. The noise cancellation is amazing almost too much so lol but they really help with blocking out the background noise! I can’t say enough good things about these. I’d definitely recommend them!', 'I think these are amazing!  They deliver!!

But they are comfortable enough. I love being able to hear the sounds around me. Highly recommend.', 'I requested these as a splurge gift for my birthday. The noise cancellation is high quality.

Good purchase!', 'I used these for the gym and they literally do not stay in. Have to adjust them all the time and don’t even think about running with them.

The most important thing is that the earphone cable is soft, which can be wrapped around the ear and can be worn outdoors. The stereo effect is very good, and the length of the cable is just right for listening to music on the phone.', 'I am very disappointed in these airpods. They worked for about a week but now they barely hold a charge. The noise cancellation doesn’t work anymore. I can’t even get through a full workout without them dying.', 'I was torn between this product and the PowerBeats. I thought the Powerbeats would be more secure.

I know it cost a fairly high amount but nothing comes close to how well works. The knock offs don’t come close!', \"While these aren't cheap, they are spectacular.  The quality is great, the sound is better and they are perfect.  My only disappointment is that I don't have an Apple phone, so using it on an Android prevents you from using some of it's features.

I would have given a review of 5 except for the fact that they keep slipping out of my ears which is so annoying!', \"They have terrific sound. The noise cancelling is excellent. But I'm not a fan of their design. Regardless of what size fitment I use, they tend to pop out of my ear. So I have to periodically push them back in.\", 'The sound is pretty balanced. A lot more bass then a lot of pairs out there. The features within the iPhone are all really cool as well. The noise canceling feature is well designed and can be switched very fast via the pressure activated area on the side of the airpod. My only true gripe is the battery life could be better and my pair have white noise during idol and quite parts of songs , videos, and movies.', 'They work great for a basic user. I mostly use them for working out at home and cleaning / around the house tasks. I have had them fall out a time or two while working out, mostly while doing ab work close to the floor so just be cautious if you plan on using at the gym. Other than that, they make answering the phone and hands free amazingly easy and I highly recommend them for anyone that just wants everyday headphones. I think the sound quality and noise cancelling are great, but I’m also not a reviewer who has tons of other options to compare. I mostly got them for ease of use and they excel greatly there.', 'I purchased this pair of airpods pro hoping for a better good purchase in the wireless headphones market but after couple months only the major issue i have with this one is that they fall down super easily, i’ve tried all the other sizes, ear fit program nothing !!

But they feel cheap', 'I was listening to a true crime podcast with my new AirPods while doing laundry in my apartment building. A creepy voice came on the interview and I pretty much jumped / peed my pants because these AirPods made me feel like the voice was coming directly next to me. Quality product!!!!

Not ideal situation to crawl on an airplane aisle to get your pod back.', 'These are my favorite ear buds. I own quite a few, and I always find myself using these.  They always pair easily with my iPhone and iPad, sound quality is superb, and battery life is excellent.', 'Giving these one star because no matter what I did they did not stay in my ears. I tried all 3 different sizes for the sole one attachments and they would fall off even while I was just walking.

I wouldn’t suggest these to anyone that I know.', 'I may not understand noise cancellation - I can hear 5he sounds of the gym while I am listening to a podcast. Music seems to work better in this regard. I’m also not sure about how snug they are supposed to fit, but they have not fallen out while I am sleeping', 'Noise cancelation is amazing. These were the cheap price I could find on amazon. Upgraded from the basic air pods and it was well worth it.', \"There's really not much comment to add to these amazing earbuds. They sound far better than regular AirPods and most other true wireless earbuds. Noise cancellation is very good and is able to immerse yourself in the music at any time.

So I exchanged them for the pros and she absolutely loves them!', 'Very disappointed. I never liked the earbuds that came with the iPhone because my ears are small.

Wish I had returned them but now it’s too late.', 'I like these, but I don’t love them and definitely don’t think they are worth the price. They fall out no matter what size I use, they randomly turn off and on in my ear without even touching them.

The sound is quite good, but I definitely don't love them.\", 'I’ve been holding off from buying wireless ear buds for sometime, mainly because of the price point of the higher end manufacturers.

The noise cancellation is as good, if not better, than my over-ear headphones. Highly recommend these!', 'The audio quality of these leaves a lot to be desired, at this price point you’d expect a higher quality product but the sound is very muddy and crackly, not impressed whatsoever. they are very convenient however, I do like the fact that they automatically connect to my phone and everything is very seamlessly integrated.', 'Updated: they make listening to your favorite music impossible & annoying!  If you move moderately they fall out. The constantly fall out!  They’ve been in the clinch, under the couch, under the fridge & almost in the sink.  Because of that & the cost I have to say I’m disappointed.', 'These sound great and do great at canceling noise. But I could not get them to stay in my ears. I really wanted to keep them so I tried some 3rd party memory foam tips....still didn’t stay in. There are a lot of people out there who have this problem. I have and love the normal AirPods, so I returned these and are sticking with the normal ones for now. Hopefully the next version of these will fit better. I will definitely try them again.

I have gone a few days without charging them and still have fully charged airpods.', 'The pairing is painless. The sound quality a great. The noise cancellation also works very well. Having it notify you of new text and read it aloud is a plus. Switching from ANC to Transparency works well most times, but I did have to put them back in their case to reset them once when it failed to switch. I use mine mostly for listening to music and for phone calls.', \"While they are quite expensive headphones, the quality is superb and, of course, it's apple. Much bigger improvement from the AirPods 2. The AirPods Pro have phenomenal noise cancelling ability. If you're shopping around for bluetooth headphones and have money to splurge, the AirPods Pro are a worthy contender. However, if you are more conservative with spending, I would consider maybe an alternative option. While they are great headphones, I don't think they are worth the very expensive price tag.\", 'Regular air pods fit better;  pro’s amplify outside sounds, not cancel them; left pod made whistling noise....sent back for a refund...back to regular air pods.', 'Terrible Apple product. First it doesn’t stay in my ear for long time. It keeps falling, second it’s hard to run and move forward/backward music. AirPod is easy. Tab twice and you are done here you have to make sure you get the knobs and press them but how am I suppose to do that while running? I simply hate it.', 'WOW. Loves these better then the standard AirPods. The custom fit ear pieces fit snug. No more falling out of the ear.

If you were disappointed by bone conduction tech you will be blown away by these.', 'They are really amazing except that they hurt my ears extremely bad.

Also easy to use.', \"They work amazingly. I use them while I'm walking to work and while I'm at work and they're perfect for noise cancelling. The ear pieces don't quite fit my ears perfectly for some reason, they always slip out little by little but that could just be me. I had the first airpods and I will say they're better but they're a little TOO pricey for just the average earbuds.\", \"Upgraded from gen 1 airpods, pretty worth it in my opinion. noise cancellation is pretty handy around school and the sound quality is great. However, they fall out pretty often. i've tried the other size ear tips and they still dont fit very well, fall out easy if you move a lot or are talking/chewing with them in.\", \"The sound quality is fantastic. The only issue I have is that they do not stay in your ear or at least my ears when I'm working out (running). The original airpods never fell out and these I'm constantly trying to adjust them back into my ear whenever they got mildly sweaty. If you're doing just everyday normal activities they stay in  perfectly fine.\", 'The product worked great. I purchased a case cover for it and ended up losing one of the AirPods.

These are seriously the best thing since sliced bread!!', 'The AirPods pro are a great upgrade to the AirPods 1st gen. The only downside is it’s not as comfortable for long listening sessions. But the versatility of noise cancelling and transparency makes up for it. Transparency is unreal you really feel like you’re not wearing any earbuds!', \"This is my second time trying the AirPods Pro, I really wanted to like these wireless earbuds, but they can't seem to deliver the same amount of bass as the previous generation AirPods. I thoroughly tested both the AirPods Pro and the previous generation AirPods, even EQing the Pro model in hopes of increasing their bass output, no luck.

My son n her are all for Apple products so yeah its definitely a five star buy', 'Apple is apple and while I think these are great, I think that there are better headphones out there.

The noise cancellation does not seem to work all the time, occasionally some intereferences when listening to music or calling on the street. A bit expensive for the product performances.', 'Sound quality is good, but don’t stay in my ears more than 10-15 minutes!! Very frustrating. Apple went really cheap on the ear tips. The material is very slippery and the tip is not form fitted at all. My Bose earbuds stays in my ear all day long. So disappointed in Apple.', 'I really wanted to like these headphones but they were pretty disappointing. They didn’t stay on my ears and were uncomfortable as well. Not only did these headphones buzz when a song hit a certain note, but there was also a noticeable buzz when I hit a certain note talking on the phone or singing along to a certain song. Perhaps I had a defective pair or they just don’t work for me, but def worst Apple headphones I have bought.', 'Amazing purchase. Awesome product. I bought many cheaper alternatives and non-work as well as the Apple brand. Really happy with this product', 'Compared to regular air pods these are pretty big.

I bought these for when I am working out or riding my bike, and they work PERFECT!!! The noise cancellation works very nicely, and it's easy to switch from that to transparency mode. I originally had the regular AirPods, but I have small ears and they would get sore after using the AirPods for long periods of time. The silicon tips on the pros are much more comfortable.

It cooperates with iPhone perfectly. If you are using iPhone, it is worthy buying. What disappoints me is it was broke after using for 4 months.

It’s an Apple authorized service provider and got a new replacement.', 'Been two months since I’ve purchased and I must say I’m very impressed. The ANC is very good for places with a moderate noise level. I’ve only had a few problems with it, but nothing too major or worth pointing out. Would definitely recommend to a friend for casual listening and for workouts.', 'Could not be happier.  Needed something light with noise cancellation.  The noise cancellation is not as good as my Bose QC35 over the ear, but these are very good for travel.  Sound quality is much better than previous Beats headphones.

I do not recommend these at all.\", 'The sound quality and battery life are really good. It’s cool how much control you have by touching the pods to pause/play, skip, and activate noise cancellation.

I hope this gets rectified soon as it was very frustrating to experience.', 'I love this airpods the range is awesome and the quality and battery life is just outstanding worth the price great job Apple.', 'I bought these for their noise cancelling quality.  I love them!  They do the job perfectly.  A little hard to describe, but they give me pure sound with the noise cancelling on, while also being able to hear a car approaching, when I am out for a walk.  They are amazing.  There is no comparison to other inferior (less costly) brands.  I have tried them.  After owing the original Airpods which I love, I took it one step further and went for the noise cancelling to be able to us on a plane.  I was NOT disappointed.', 'Tried them out. Heard bad things.

Also when listening to movies. Very frustrating to spend this much money for what is turning into a shoddy product.', 'They worked great for a couple weeks, then the right earbud stopped working and i couldn’t get it to work no matter what I did. I tried connecting them to another device to see if my phone was the issue, but they wouldn’t even connect at all to other devices - I tried connecting to 2 different iPhones and an iPad and they wouldn’t work. I want a refund and replacement but I’ve had them too long and now I can’t return them. I’m very frustrated.', 'Was under the impression I was getting brand new AirPods. Only to find out I brought used AirPods. They don’t seem damaged at all and look barely touched but for the same price I could had brought them brand new. These are a gift and luckily I am able to still gift them would had like them to be brand new though..', 'This review is more for Amazon. They sent me a fake product. One was made in China the other in Vietnam. Did not work well. Noise canceling works for the user however people on the other end of the call hears all the noises from the user’s background. Makes no sense.', 'Great product. I did not like the fit of the regular AirPods so I bought these. They fit a lot more comfortably in my ears. They sound good and have excellent noise cancellation.', 'Never could have imagined how useful these little ears buds are. It’s a game changer to have wireless discreet sound wherever you go. The three different sized tips are a huge help from the previous version. I can get a solid, comfortable fit and they never fall out compared to the hard plastic originals. Highly recommend!', \"AirPods were great but lacked noise cancellation, bass and in-ear fit. Airpod Pros solve those problems. The transparent setting is great for around the office and the noise cancellation works great in a noisy environment. Haven't tried them on a flight yet.\", 'The noise cancellation works alright but only if it’s not too loud. i love the transparent mode for work. The battery life is great. Literally listen to them all day. The tracker function and the beep have already come in handy, as i almost lost one chasing my adventurous pooch down the street. I go through headphones like crazy & these are holding up nicely plus i can’t lose them. So it’s a win win', \"They don't stay in my ear and I've tried every bud size. They constantly disconnect from my phone and are very touchy. They also have trouble connecting in the first place. If I try to keep them in my ears they end calls if I touch them in the wrong place.

They are such a horrible product I've been motivated to write my first review on Amazon in 10 years of purchasing.\", 'I mean if you have a Apple product especially IPhone then it is definitely a good buy. The noice cancellation is simply amazing and useful as well. The sound quality is better and much crispier if the noice cancellation is turned on. The transparency mode makes it easier to listen to other background noises. Definitely worth my buy. Would recommend it over other AirPods and wireless earbuds.', 'These headphones are sleek, highly functional, and a nice improvement over earlier models. Noise cancellation is excellent and the transparent mode is safer for jogging/exercise. Totally worth the money!!!', 'Everything was amazing, don’t get me wrong. We ended up refunding and going back to our regular AirPods because it hurt our ears. We switched sizes and thought it might have been us but a family friend has the same problem. If you can wear them comfortably, they are worth every single penny !', 'Only thing is I leave them in my ears for too long and the hard plastic is causing irritation in my ears that I’ll have to get over. Other than that, sound quality & noise cancellation is amazing. & they stay in my ears. Probably top of the line earbuds for the current moment.', 'Works almost too well.. the noise cancellation almost sounds like you’re In a vacuum or what space would sound like. Almost as if there’s negative pressure in your ears. Highly recommend over the originals which I just upgraded from.', \"I'm allergic to these and replacing the silicone tips doesn't fix the issue. Since I had no problems with the regular Airpods I can only assume these must use some inferior grade plastic.\", \"Thought the AirPods Pro would be an upgrade from my traditional AirPods, but they are not. The only notable feature is the noise cancellation; however, it is not worth it. Noise cancellation only works if the Pros maintain a firm seal in your ears and this is not the case. The seal in my ears is constantly broken and they keep falling out repeatedly. I've used every size tip and multiple methods to try to keep them in my ears and they just don't stay. Exchanged these for a new pair of the regular AirPods and now I'm happy.\", 'Im kinda unhappy with this purchase. The pair ive received had an issue from first day of use. The issue is that right earphone is not charging sometimes, this is growing into a huge problem when I have meeting at the morning and right before joining Im noticing that left has 100% charge but right earphone is dead. And I want for the seller to consider this review as replacement request, as Im getting tired of this issue. Thank you', 'I was reluctant to buy the AirPods because of price and the older pods did not stay in my ear. Well, cry once my father said. Love them! They stay in ear because of the new design and the noise canceling is great! Worth the price.', 'The earbuds sound great but offer little to no noise cancelation. The most it will filter out is quiet background noise like a computer fan or the air conditioning. Other than that it doesn’t do much. I can still hear people talking normally 25 feet away and the gym music which is the whole reason I got them in the first place.', 'I love everything about this AirPods Pro but the price. It is too pricy and expensive, but if you are addicted to the Apple echo system, you will not be happy with a substitute or chip imitation.', 'Great product. I bought 2 units for me and my wife and really worth it! Outstanding sound quality and noise cancellation! Battery could be better, but 4 hours is not bad. Amazon was incredible delivering the products extremely fast!', 'heard my girlfriend cry across her house on face-time with two doors closed and her fan running aswell as pc plus since she lives in an apartment i also had to deal with hearing her neighbor yell at fortnite. but despite all that i still heard her ass bawling. noise cancellation helped alot with hearing it too. apple did a fantastic job cant recommend it enough.', 'Terrible issue with the case popping open an the ear buds fall out.

It helps when I’m trying studying in a noisy coffee shop or if you just want to listen to music without the background around. Transparency mode is also very nice in its own way. If I’m around the house I usually have this on that way I can hear what’s going on around me. I’m terms of sound quality, I don’t say it differs much from the original AirPods but if those two features are something you’re interested in, this is a good choice to go with.', 'I love how they repeat your text messages to you if your listening to music. They really block out sound. They are the best and worth every penny!', 'These are amazing but DONT FIT IN MY EARS. I’ve bought new attachments to replace the silicone ear things and they still fall out all the time and hurt my ears. I even looked up tutorials about putting them in and have tried everything.', \"I've had these for a couple of months or so now and I'm very disappointed in the charging not working properly.  At first it was the right ear pod, now that one charges most times but now the left one won't charge.  When they do charge, they only last for a couple of hours.  I've had to resort to going back to using my wired set.  I sure would like to return these, but the return window has closed now.  First time buyer of Apple product, probably won't buy Apple again due to this experience.\", \"These are amazing, especially upgrading from my gen 1's! The Transparency mode and ANC are both amazing, and Spatial audio is also great! The only thing that is not my favorite is battery life, but it is still great!\", \"I brought these from amazon on March 25th to replace a pair that I lost. I loved my air pods when I had them before, the noise cancelling worked great (not perfect), and the battery life was also satisfactory. But after buying them from amazon and receiving broken ones, I decided to just repurchase them on apple instead. I'm currently in the midst of returning them but product-wise, they are great! Just get them from a reliable dealer (apple).\", 'I upgraded my AirPods to the AirPods Pro and loving it!! The noise canceling feature is awesome.

Noise cancellation and sound quality are elite.', 'I greatly enjoyed the sound and noise cancellation.  Almost unnoticeable when turned on. I like them so much.  But I am greatly disappointed in the life of the battery.  Sad face. Beats pro last all day.  I have regrets about my purchase.', 'I love these and listen to music on them however they make a high pitched sound for some reason when I hold them in one hand together. Manufacturing defect? The features are great, I just have the complaint about that and they fall out if dropped in case.', 'I’ve been using them for a few months now and I love them. I had the powerbeats pro before and these are way better. My favorite is the noise calculation. It’s amazing. These are so much easier to carry around as well. I keep them in my purse.', 'This is everything I expected from this Apple product.  I especially like the noise cancellation feature.  That is especially true when I vacuum.  I just put on some music, activate the noise cancellation feature and go to work. I can hardly hear our noisy vacuum at all and it makes this chore much more enjoyable.', 'The originals would fit my ear perfect. The pros had an ok fit as long as I wasn’t active.

Very Very dissatisfied with this product. I do not recommend but I would recommend the regular AirPods. Owned a pair for 2 years, until I lost them :( and never had a problem.', 'Sound quality is average. Noise cancellation is top tier for ear buds. Battery life is right around 5 hours. But you won’t use them for that long so it’s good. The money comes from the eco system with Apple. Automatically reads texts messages in your ear. Hey Siri works like a charm. Connects in an instant. Spatial audio is a work of art. Stylish. Overall value is more like $180 than 250 but you know the Apple logo is and extra $70.', 'They don’t stay in your ears, even worse than the original. I’m constantly having to press them back in. It would only be worse if I were exercising and or sweating a lot. Not good since they are so expensive and will get damaged if you drop them too often. I have tried all of the provided tip sizes.  There are aftermarket replacement tips that advertise combating this issue, that tells you it must be common. It would be nice if apple would correct this. Sound quality and noise cancelling are great.', 'So thrilled with these!

They also have a pretty good range, can leave my phone on the patio while I’m working around the yard.', 'i only gave them a four because the left one doesn’t really fit . i just got my airpods pro and the right one fits really good but the left one hurts my ear 😣 i tried different ear tips but it still hurts so idk . i saved money to but these myself and now i can’t really enjoy both airpods 💔💔💔 maybe my ears are different i don’t really know .. but other than that these are really good honestly . i totally recommend them !', 'These are a huge step up from the previous version. They are comfortable to wear and do a great job canceling out noise. The clear mode also makes them great when you need to hear people talking or be aware of certain sounds around you.', 'Sound is awesome!', 'Bought my husband a pair, was a little worried since I bought them from Amazon rather than Apple. There have been no issues and he loves them.', 'These are original airpods by Apple with lesser price tag on Amazon. Comes in an authentic box which includes charging cable and extra buds. Has amazing features and fits perfectly in my ears even while working out. Most recommended to buy here than Apple store to save at least $70.', 'I mostly use these for working out. Combine these with a Apple Watch and you have a modern iPod. The noise cancellation is great for areas that are noisy and I don\\'t have to increase the volume to unsafe levels. The \"Transparent\" mode is clear enough to hold conversations unless you have the music blasting.

I do not understand the product limit... its not toilet paper geesh.', 'Got these a little over a week ago and love them!!  I have a job driving a delivery truck and use them daily for hands free calling, one air pod at the time.  The call quality is amazing!  It is really easy to hear the person you are talking to, and they have no noise interference on their end from my truck.  The music sound quality and noise cancellation is great, also.  Can’t believe I waited so long before jumping on a pair of these!

This is simply magical, as son as you turn on noise cancellation, it just feels like you’re in a different world. The transparency mode is freaking amazing, I don’t have to remove these out of my ear to talk to someone anymore, I can also walk on the street knowing a car won’t run me over. This is a day and night difference if you compare these to the old AirPods (AirPods 1st and 2nd gen). This is worth every penny and I’m really satisfied with this product. 10/10', 'Got an empty box!

Cancelación de ruido perfecta, adhesión al oído, se sostienen muy bien mientras me ejercito. LOS SUPER RECOMIENDO.', \"I am surprised at how much I like this product.  I had the older version of the product - non pro - and they were/are also very good.  I gave those to my son.  Anyway the pro's have noise cancelling which is really cool.  I am also very impressed with how you sound on the phone to others with these...\", 'For the price, it’s just what I expected it to be. Great sound quality and easy to connect to iphone or mac. It amazes me how long the battery last after one charge. The only downside is how uncomfortable my ears get from long duration use. The noise cancellation works well but doesn’t actually cancel out all the noises around you. Overall, I recommend this if you can get it for the right price.', 'Best thing Apple created! Love the case and the snug fit in my ears, and they also have noise cancellation and transparency hearing which is cool! Would recommend to get one for yourself or someone who loves music or entertainment and answer many calls on phone.', 'I just used these for the first time yesterday. These are great (so far)! They sound good and sound canceling is good, as well. This is the 1st expensive pair of ear buds, so will see if they’re worth it.', \"I wouldn't recommend for you to try and run it through a washer and dryer, but mine did and they are still functioning. Pairs nicely with the iPhone. Only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is I find in general Apple products leave much to be desired with their price point. It would be nice if it could capture a more broad frequency range, especially in the lower bass and higher treble areas\", 'I’m so glad I bought these. The sound is great! Battery life seems great too. While in the case I can lay them on a charging pad or use the “ new” charger I bought.', 'Love the quality of the sound and the extra padding for the ears. Noise cancellation is better than good. It seems any Apple products need to be charged often', \"I bought these after seeing the amount of reviews giving it 5-stars. However, after using it for working out and also through facetime, I found that these tend to slide out of my ears and got uncomfortable after about 30 minutes of use.

I love how it fit my ears and the noise canceling function. I also got WF-1000XM3 but its noise canceling function doesn’t feel good as this AirPod pro. One major problem is the battery life.', 'In order to use these headphones, I have to delete them from my devices and reset them up as a new device every time. This can take up to ten minutes sometimes and I have went back to using wired headphones over these.', \"I use my pods for work mostly, and being in different environments means I'm gonna be in noisy areas.  I cannot just stop working simply because I'm at an airport, coffee shop, in my car, around my kids, in a restaurant etc.  If you live your biz life on your phone do yourself a fav and pick these up, expense them if you must but they are that good.\", \"I'm glad I purchased the air pods pro.  Well worth the money.  I put them in and use my Amazon Prime music and am lost in the tunes.  Has helped tremendously with my exercise regimen.  I go out walking and keep going to listen to many of the songs in my play list.\", \"If you have small ears, don't get them. I currently have scabs in both ears because the seam presses up against my crus or helix in my ear has been irritating my ears (the left one in particular) to the point of bleeding. I'm returning them. Listen to everyone else about the sound, they're great on that.\", 'I love almost everything about them, the only reason I gave them 3/5 is because I can’t do a set of bench press without one or both falling out and bouncing/rolling around the gym. I also need to be fiddled with after just about every set of other exercises to make sure they are tight and don’t fall out which is very frustrating', 'They are awesome... also smaller than the original AirPods that hang below ear and look funny. Fit is comfortable... very easy link up between iPhone/ Mac (auto connect and stops playing if you remove one ear pod... can be turned off if wanted). Also I like how there is noise cancelling mode and transparency mode. Both have there uses and I love it', 'Love these! Was being defiant and not giving in to the hype of AirPods but I am glad I finally did. Game changer. Hands free, wire free, just perfect. Now if they would just put a tracker on them so I stop leaving them places, that would be nice.', 'Had two goals for these: (1.) to wear while sleeping to drown out hubby’s snoring (while streaming white noise tracks) and (2.) to work out with. They weren’t good for either. They were too uncomfortable to wear while sleeping and wouldn’t stay in my ears, especially once I started moving and sweating during workouts. Don’t recommend these.', 'Apple seems to have learned about past issues with  headphones. These so far are steps above the original airpods', 'It charges super fast and cancels the surrounding noise. It has been perfect so far! (~6 months of everyday use). High quality product!!!', 'Good sound.  The charging box is very nice and fits right in your pocket.  I highly recommend this product.', 'Legitimately great set of headphones especially if you can get a great deal the transparency mode is perfect for anybody who works and has to talk to people every now and then.

The Spatial audio is amazing. (Look up to see what this is.) These do have a noise canceling option and transparent options which are great. It comes with the charging case, charging cable and different size ear caps. These are definitely worth the price.', 'Not really worth it.  If you have the regular airpods these aren’t much different.  I have both and wouldn’t recommend. Plus they don’t fit small ears.', 'This the 2nd set I purchased.  Returned 1st set after 2 weeks the right ear piece quit working.  Happy enough they replaced them.  Now the 2nd set worked very well until today which is 2 weeks over my return time.

Wondering maybe these are refurbished ear pods. 😢', 'These work great for good sound and battery life is excellent. They do very little to block out noise though.

Don’t waste your money', 'Love these!!  Stay in my ear so much better than regular AirPods.  The noise cancelling function is a complete game changer. Won’t buy anything without that now.', \"The only reason I rated these fairly low is because my tiny ears still can't find headphones to fit and stay put. The second I bend down an AirPod falls right out. I'm constantly pushing them back in or readjusting them which makes them pause the music or whatever I'm listening to which just gets annoying. I hear there are some memory foam attachments to switch the silicone parts out for so maybe I'll give that a try.\", 'I love these. I’ve bought cheaper one’s but the battery dies within 30 minutes. These last much longer. They’re comfortable and the noise canceling is amazing. Pop them in, turn on the noise canceling, and you hear nothing but your music.

The battery last longer than first and second generation. It also support wireless charge.', 'Airpod Pros were a great buy! have been wanting a pair of wireless headphones and hesitated but thought, for the price why not. very happy with my purchase.

After that you encounter so many issues, like static noises whenever you try to adjust your airpods in your ears bc the external microphones seem to be really sensitive or something idk, after that either one or both will start making a crackling sound and there’s nothing you can do about it, save yourself, they’re awful, just because they’re Apple doesn’t mean they’re good. I’m actually going back to the second generation ones, they were so much better, I would’ve never gotten the pros if dumbxss wouldn’t dropped my gen 2 in the toilet as it was flushing. Not worth it, buy better headphones', 'Man, I wish I could love these. Noise cancellation is on point. Audio quality is on point. Transparency mode is AMAZING!!!

After these were announced I suddenly noticed so much more that my first gen Airpods kept slipping out and I kept using my shoulder to push them back in. And every time I would laugh they would slowly get pushed out! I got fed up of that, and fan noise in certain situations. So I ordered them off here and they are, amazing. I expected to use the small tips but apparently the large tips fit perfect. None slip and I can actually laugh and talk with these in. The noise canceling is top notch and all around worth the price.', 'The pros are undeniable noise cancelling and great sound quality, but they won’t stop falling out my ear.

Also I got them at 5 pm and I ordered them mid day', 'After having them for more than a month, I can say that these do not feel confortable in my ear at all. I’ve tried all sizes that came in the box but didn’t really make a difference. They either kept shifting or slowing start to come loose so having these in the gym was a nightmare. The price for these are way too high for what they offer. If you have the air pods 2, just stay with those and save your money. PS. I have the Samsung buds + and these are waaaay better. The sound quality is not so different so it’s really good for the price.', \"In light of overall design advantages (e.g. very comfortable, compact, immediate synching across Apple devices, etc...) the sound quality and quality of noise cancellation seems excellent.

The first generation was faulty and I could feel electric pulses which gave me headaches. When I researched the issue online it seems quite a few people had the same issue. That’s not been the case with this version. I will say that they’re good but not great for noise canceling - but the transparency mode is terrific. I’ll also add that they’re a bit quirky on reconnecting to my phone when I jump on/off calls. Last night they’re kept connecting but no sound. I kept switching Bluetooth outputs and it just didn’t work. I literally restarted my phone to get it to work again.', 'These AirPod Pros are absolutely awesome.

I guess I should have known better than to wear them out as they pop out constantly but what is the point of having AirPods if you can not use them.  So I am going to attempt to return the one remaining AirPod Pro and use my regular AirPods which are better quality, less expensive and less aggravation.

UI is great. Sound quality is ok. The fit and finish is garbage though. Seeing as these are definitely considered premium earbuds the fit and finish should be amazing.

For the practicality and convenience these pods offer, it’s really obvious why Apple products are superior. Simple, and a lot of nice features like connecting 2 sets of pods to one phone and sharin music.', 'I am absolutely in love with my airpods pro. It is incredible that you can turn on noise cancelling and then you can barely hear anything that is going on around you. They are definitely more expensive than the original airpods, but I would say it is worth the extra money. They are super small and fit in my ears very well, it is also nice that it comes with different sized attachments to fit any ear. And if you are unsure of which size you should use, your iphone comes with a test to tell you! These definitely exceeded my expectations and I am absolutely thrilled with them.', 'Much better than the original AirPods.  Highly recommend.  I can cut the grass or weedeat without having music all the way up. Spend the money. Worth every penny.', 'Great sound quality overall. Noise cancellation is amazing for an in-ear device. Battery life is very good. Can be uncomfortable if worn for prolonged period but for an hour or so is fine. Stable in ear; I have worked out, gone on runs, and biked with these and stayed in place with only a few times of having to readjust.', 'Good sound and noise cancellation.. bad battery life', 'This is so much better the previous gen. I have. Sound and comfort is excellent. No The best thing is the noise cancelation on background is much improved since they are a EarPods design. I’m glad I upgraded. Also this a genuine product not a knockoff.', 'I was not impressed with these earphones at all. I thought they would be better because of all of the hype but I will stick with my Beat by Dre Bluetooth earphones.', 'If you want headphone that fall off your ear so easily all the time, buy then. After adjusting the headphones to a different fit, so that they don’t fall out and fit right….they still fall off. Two friends purchased the same headphones as me and they’ve explained to have experienced the same thing. So annoying!!!! Try them out but if you have the same thing happen…Just return them right away. Not worth it.', \"Love that these are wireless and integrate so well into the iOS ecosystem. Noise cancellation is good but still not as good as my Bose QC20. That's the only reason I've giving it 4 stars instead of 5. I'm sure they'll improve the noise cancellation in future iterations.\", 'I have ordered and returned 2 pairs now and now have decided to try the normal AirPods instead. Both pairs of my pros stopped working within a week of buying for different reasons. The first pair, one of them would not charge. The second pair, one of them would not register that it was in my ear and therefor it never turned on. After numerous times of resetting them and talking with customer support I gave up. I would avoid them!', 'Another fine product from Apple.  Love the noise cancellation feature and dynamic sound.  I wish I could get them to not fall out of my ear canal so easily though.', 'I purchased the Apple Air Pods Pro for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. The best feature according to her is the noise cancellation. She loves the quality of the sound and she insists that I purchase a pair for myself. Her older sister tried them and liked them so much that she purchased a pair.', 'I love my AirPod pros, I had the a pair of the first generation of AirPods that the mic stopped working on multiple times and I just haws to keep getting them replaced.  But with only a one year warranty and no AppleCare (A mistake I didn’t do this time), I was told it would be $79 per AirPod to get them replaced! But I haven’t had a problem with these yet, so I’m hoping that they new design will prevent that issue from happening again. In summary much better sound quality and clarity than first generation AirPods, and also the noise cancellation is a great feature.', 'Was having problems with them staying connected. Took them to the apple store only to find out they were fake', 'These fit so much better in your ears and so much more comfortable than the 1st ones. Was very disappointed that they don’t come with the plug for the USB -C that apple is changing their stuff to, when they have always given you the plug not just the lighting cable.', \"They worked great, had good noise cancelation and the sound was great.  I wouldn't suggest running them through the washer and dryer as my wife did, it will render them useless.\", 'Overall these work well. My biggest downfall are the rubber ear pieces. They are uncomfortable and always have been. That was a big reason I stopped using my wireless beats. AirPods version 2 style would be better comfort. If you are looking for AirPods and don’t really have a need for noise cancellation I don’t suggest the pro.', 'Killer sound and cancellation is a nice touch if in a room. nice to be able to track if lost.', 'These are so comfortable in my ear when all others are not. I think I’ve tried at least half a dozen different pair. They paired easily with a Windows 10, Lenovo computer.', 'I was really excited to receive my package when as soon as I opened the package I instantly noticed the seal was broken and off and the box was filthy with smears and dirt. I received old and used AirPod pros instead of new ones. I’m extremely disappointed.', 'The AirPods Pro sound just like the AirPods 2, to my ears. Maybe is just me. In regards to noise canceling it works ok, but not great. Comfort is not bad but they stat to become lose little by little until eventually they will pop out. I tried the eartip test and I git the same result with all of them, however the smaller top felt better in my ear on longer period of use. Overall, I would rather get the AirPods Pro 2 and save money in the process.', 'Best earbuds I used so far, worth the extra over the regular airpods and the tangled wire mess of earpods. Not cheap, but small easy to carry compared to big over ear ones. Same as your phone and item you use a lot every day can cost something more.', 'The product is excellent. But even though the box came sealed, when I opened then box to sync them they are already named. The right piece had 75% charge and the left 35%. Clearly previously owned. That’s gross', 'The sound quality and noise cancellation on these is excellent.  As is the built in Siri integration.  The problem I have is that I sweat a lot and they do not stay in.  I have had them fall out during workouts, during a bike ride, while working on a ladder.  I am fairly disappointed in them.', 'The sound is amazing and the seamless pairing is to but they make a weird noise when being pushed in your ear so you need to put them in your ears, carefully? Another thing is that never try to hold them in the palm of your hand. When you squeeze you force air into the device and you can hear high pitch noise coming from them. The noise cancelling is fantastic, but it can be 1000% better if you go and buy foam tips for the earpiece, the silicone ones have a habit of falling out of your ears or noise cancellation not blocking out enough noise.', 'Goes great with my new case! I can never go anywhere without my trusty earbuds! Glad I upgraded to a more expensive pair after only using 20$ cheap Bluetooth earbuds.  I hope they will last me a very long time', \"The new Airpods are disappointing. The noise-cancelling works about as good as earbuds could be. The lower frequency bass is muddy. These new buds don't sound as good as the older ones did and the equalizer controls in the iPhone don't function at all. ?????\", 'Absolutely love these. I knocked it down from 5 starts because I really dislike that you can’t adjust the volume without Siri or having your phone nearby. It’s hard to tell how loud I’m talking with headphones in as it is, but it feels like I have to yell “hey Siri” to get her to hear me so I can turn the volume down.', \"I got this item by October 2020, and just a month after the purchase warranty of 90 days ended they got broken, charger not working completely, tried all options provided by apple to make them work with assistance from a tech support from apple and nothing worked, they gave option to get them check but at the end of the day I'll have to pay for a replacement. The product is great but it's warranty is not.\", 'These really keep the noise at bay and work well with my iPhone. I use them when vacuuming and have no problem hearing voices to music.', 'These things are just another example of Apple making a product that you say “I would never pay that “ then get it and say “Holy crap these are awesome!” . Spatial audio is a game changer.', 'I love these headphones! I’ve been wearing them everyday since I got them. They’re perfect for the gym and they’ve never even felt like they were going to fall out on a run. The noise calculation works great. I use this setting when I’m trying to study because any small noises distract me. Highly recommend these. I’m very impressed by how much better they are than the 1st and 2nd gen AirPods!', 'Excellent sound and very good quality. My only issue is for what Apple charges for this product, you’d think the add the full charging cord and outlet.', 'Have to agree with some other users. Buying this for my nephews for Xmas was extravagant enough. Much less for them to call me cuz they can’t charge them because apple failed to supply a charging box. Shame shame apple', 'After my original AirPods gave up after four years of faithful service, I replaced the with the Pros. Great bass response. As a bassist myself I value that. And the fit is much better. Love them.', 'The AirPod Pros are a beast in sound quality and noise cancellation. I truly enjoyed being able to either hear or not hear others with the simple hold of a button. What I did not enjoy, and have found with others that have bought this product, is that the physical design of the device does not lend itself well with some ear types. It caused a ton of discomfort after only an hours worth of use.', 'I love these AirPod Pros I had the first generation at first they were okay, but nothing compared to the pros. I love the noise cancellation I feel invincible when I turn it on at the store or anywhere. Transparency is also a great feature. My dislike is that the first generation has 5hours of listening time and the Airpod Pros have 4.5hours. That kind of threw me off but I love them', \"The buds FALL OFF ALL THE TIME. The product comes with 3 different size rubber tips but NONE of them fit perfectly. I can't walk more than 1 minute before the buds start wiggling out. I used all three size tips and all have the same behavior. I used to hate earbuds with rubber tips before the age of AirPods and this reminded me exactly why. The sound quality is also very mediocre for a $250 earbud. Over a decade of using a wide variety of Apple products, this one is the worst engineered one yet.\", 'Good sound. User friendly and easy to connect and switching devices. Great fit at least for me. Never fell out of ears. Have been using for work related meetings and never heard anyone complaining. Never had regular air pods but I am pretty sure it was well worth the extra money spent.', \"Can't believe I got these for 20% off Apple's retail and got Apple Care too. I use these every day. So comfortable that I have fallen asleep with them in and have been comfortable to wake up with them still in place hours later.\", 'These are very good value, they have great sound quality and alright noise cancellation, but the battery kinda sucks, the earbuds last about 3 hours, and the case can charge them about 3-4 times. The case scratches  very easily so i put a protective case on mine. With the new software update, on iphone, you can track the earbuds similarly to the apple airtag which makes them difficult to loose.', 'i bought it in used-like new condition where the item is supposed to be in perfect condition. It came disgusting with someone’s ear wax and ear hair in it. scratches and dirt all over the case and airpods. Truly disgusting. Buy them brand new.', 'Very good sound Quality. Fits OK but not great. Fits better than the previous version. One of the reasons I got this was for it’s noise cancellation. It does not do that very well. Too bad. I would not buy this again. I made a mistake. Too much good press which wasn’t justified.', 'Tried many different Bluetooth pods prior to this purchase. If you have an iPhone and are looking for pods just get the real thing and don’t waste your time on anything else.', '', 'For the amount of money this cost, I was expecting the sound quality to be somewhat exceptional. Had I known what the sound quality was, I would have never purchased them. The sound quality of these AirPods is the same as the wired headphones you used to receive when you purchased an Apple product which is not all that good at best.', 'I still use it. It’s pretty nice and does the job. I like the size of them as well and the fact that you can adjust it to the size of your ear. Convenient', 'I don’t like feeling like I’m plugged up with rubber ear plugs. That’s what every other earbud feels like to me. The AirPod Pro’s don’t though and they sound awesome. The active noise cancellation is magical!', \"Occasionally,  my case would open up and an airpod would fall out. It was just a matter of time before I lost one. Apple wants $90 to replace one. I'm not happy.\", 'I use these everyday. I love them fits perfectly in my ear and are very comfortable.  They don’t fall out.  Sound is great.  I will buy these again but I think new ones will be out before these one need replaced.  Highly recommend these', 'Although these seem to play music really well. The battery life isn’t up to pare. I’ve used consistently for about 3 weeks. And the battery life doesn’t seem to hold more than 5 hours. Also, they fall out of the ear very easily.', 'The sound quality is amazing I’d have to say and the noise cancellation works wonders while I’m studying and trying to drown out the voices and noise around me. It hasn’t given me a headache. The only thing I do dislike is when you have it a little longer in your ears it’ll start to slip out but other than that it’s great! The battery life on the other hand is good. Lasts me about 3-4 hours and I love how it charges quickly in the pods. I love it! :)', \"I so wanted to love these. But they fall out and I can't get a good fit with ear buds. Noise cancelation is useless unless if you can't get a good fit. I ended up with a Raycon E55 which solved all my issues\", 'There are a lot of audio products similar to these offered by other tech brands that are cheaper and work just as good or better. The Apple name is a reason behind this high price tag.', 'Very uncomfortable and even with small rubber inserts they do not fit snug at all. Fall out and definitely not sound canceling. Controls are strange and battery life for new buds is only so so. Would not buy again.', 'Sound quality is actually pretty darn good compared to the wired ones the phone came with. When I wear these at work, the noise canceling is amazing. You truly don’t hear anything, even someone talking directly to you unless you take one out. Five stars', 'The sound is very good and rich. The AirPods don’t stay in my ears when I speak on the phone. They loosen and fall out. The  AirPods 2 stay in my ear better and the sound is almost as good.', 'I got these at a great buy when I bought mine and they are outstanding! I love them.', \"I ordered this product when it was on sale for $199 and thought it was a deal. I could not have been more wrong. I had the original Airpods and have been happy with them for years. After daily heavy usage the batteries no longer last and I decided I would treat myself to the AirPods Pro. Well, these will not pair with my phone even after fully charging, trying multiple times to reboot my phone. I am now left frustrated and disappointed that I wasted time even attempting to get these to work. Don't waste your time or money.\", 'My brother kept telling me to get a pair because they are good for noise cancellation. I wish I had bought them months ago, these are absolutely awesome and worth the money!', 'Sorry I bought these because one ear. (Left) does not fit securely. Sound is OK but a $20 pair of Mpow Flame pods sound better. Apple did not engineer these well, regardless of cushion size won’t stay in ear. Bummer!!!', 'I really thought I was going to like these. They were okay sound at first, not nearly as loud as I thought. If you are using them for exercise or working out they will consistently fall out if you are sweating and the noise cancelation is subpar at best. Finally they lasted not 8 months and now the right bud on mine has static like the speaker blew in it. For the price these are trash very upset.', 'Overall the earphones are great but keep in mind these depend on each person. None of the sizes fit comfortably (either they would fall off or cause some pain). Noise cancelling and transparency are cool features. Overall they are good earphones, but there are much better ones at this price point. Pairing process is the easiest out there. Battery life isnt long (about 4 hours), but they charge really quickly.', 'I had to take them to be fixed 4 times in the past 3 months i bought them Does not charge one of the earpods', 'Definitely not the best noise canceling but impressive for size. I’m marking it down because of how garbage this case is. I set it down too hard and these babies pop right out. I wish the case had a more hard spring. they are apple products, pretty, well built, over priced, but you get what you know you wanted', 'Brand new. Unopened. 100% authentic. Delivered within 2 hours of purchasing. The option to add Apple Care for two extra years is icing on the cake. Couldn’t be happier with the purchase.', 'I received these a few days ago.

Sound quality is great well.', 'Purchase it once and lost them 2 day. love it so much had too work some overtime to purchase them again. worth every penny for me.', 'The software was out of date.  Other than that, all went well, and I just spent a few hours trying to get an appointment at the Apple store to get the headphones exchanged.

The batteries do run down pretty quickly.', \"I like these headphones. Noise cancellation is great. However, it doesn't work with my Android phone as good as my iPhone.

Works great with other Apple products but not with the other brands.\", 'Sound quality is 9/10 Noise cancelling 10/10 Battery life 6/10 Fit 2/10 - cannot use these for running! They fall out about every .1 miles so irritating. I use my old Samsung Bluetooth for running and they are great. Battery live is better - sound is comparable and they just don’t have noise cancelling. These turned into a really expensive WebEx head set lol', 'Sound quality is great. Take time to find the correct size ear buds. My son was impressed with the battery life.', 'Bought these pods for my Son before the start of the new school year. They were defaulted. Would not hold their charge and sound quality was static. I tried to return and seller would not give me a refund. Crappy product and crappy customer service. Very Disappointed!', 'the sound quality and anc is so great and i love it on these airpods. i upgraded from my airpod gen 2s for these and was very upset. the top of the airpod has a microphone cutout and it is so sharp. It makes me dread wearing theses pods because of this one issue. i wanted to keep them so badly, but im not wasting $200 for a pair of earbuds that kill my ears. Will be returning', \"The AirPods Pro are AMAZING and the noise cancellation is my favorite part and the reason I purchased them in the first place. The only issues I have is the battery life and how it loosens overtime in my right ear. The battery is pretty good for headphones but I use them a lot with school and I normally don't charge them at night but not a big deal. The other issue is that my right airpod loosens in my right ear after time and can fall out when I'm eating or running but maybe it's because I have small ears. But overall one of Apple's best products.\", \"Great idea, love the noise cancellation, I can hear fine on them, but the microphone is bad. I didn't realize how much they were cutting out for other people. It has become a running joke at work that my headphones suck. So 5 months after purchasing these, I am retiring them, because I can't let poor headphones affect my work reputation. I'm very sad, I had high expectations.\", 'I was hesitating to buy since I have the regular Airpods already, but I’m glad I bought them. They sound way better than the older version. Wearing them with the Noise Cancellation on the first time gave a weird feeling. But I got uses to it.', 'I gave these as a gift and was very embarrassed when the recipient opened them and found the pods dirty.', 'Got them to be able to access Dolby Atmos in Apple Music.

Normal apple ear pieces hurt my ears severely so I never liked any old style but these have always been comfortable even after hours of use.

I love!  Great noise cancellation too, but I can still hear my partner snore. :(  I would like the airpods to be smaller (just the pods ... maybe that is coming soon?) so I can sleep in them more comfortably.

After being a loyal Apple consumer, I thought these would be worth the cost.  I was wrong.  They do not work.  There's constant static, only one works at a time.  I've tried disconnecting/reconnecting and still the same problem.  I will be returning or exchanging these.  Total junk.\", \"Great product. Everything about it is almost positive.

Before the Airpods Pro I used other earbuds brands, but this product definitely exceeded my expectations. Great sound, comfortable, and pretty decent battery life. Product came as bought in the Apple Store and worked perfectly well. Interaction with the Iphone XR is amazing and works wonderfully. I am very happy with my purchase. 100% recommend.', 'These are my second pair and just like the first pair I wake up every morning to find the right AirPod is completely drained while sitting in the case overnight. The charging contact for the pods are extremely finicky so often the right pod, or sometimes the left, will just lose contact with the charging plate for no real reason other than poor design, which is unacceptable in my opinion for this price point.', 'My son loves them although he only wears one at a time. He accidently drove over one with his bike when he fell over but It was easy to replace it at an apple store for about $80. New pros keep sound in his ear so I don’t have to hear it, unlike standard model.', 'I’ve had a couple other pair of wireless earbuds but these don’t fit just right. I’ve tried to switch to the other tips but they keep sliding out of my ears, working out or not. Sound quality and noise cancellation are unreal though', 'I used it on a recent trip across the ocean. It woks well and you need to find the right ear pieces. On the plus - very light earphones; on the minus - there is increased noise with eating or yawning', 'The quality of these EarPods are great — when they work. I have so much trouble getting these to reconnect to my phone after I recharge them. Some days they won’t reconnect at all. Frustrating since the new iPhones don’t have a plug for traditional EarPods. I often have to go without without. Will not purchase again.', 'I won’t even lie to y’all the sound quality and everything is great but when it comes to them being stable in your ears that’s a NO GO! People say it depends on ear size but at this point I don’t know because everyone I know that owns them they fall out of their ears as well. When I smile, talk, laugh, or just laying/ standing there they fall out (yes I’ve tried the different sized things)', 'Awesome product owned my pair since release and just bought another pair as a gift always been one to buy cheap headphones and replace them once they died on my but this was worth the purchase', 'I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY AIRPODS PRO ! after my original 1st AirPods got lost, I had to replace them and bought these ones and THEY ARE SO MUCH BETTER :) I normally don’t like Bluetooth products and would’ve bought the headphones with the iPhone plug in but these noise canceling AirPods are way better. And the battery life is AMAZING.', 'Supposedly these aren’t supposed to fall out your ears but after trying all three fits and doing the test I thought they were fine but fell out when I was hiking and just so happened to fall into a pond so now I only have one left AirPod 🥺', 'Much better fit than the normal AirPods. First wireless ear buds I’ve actually turned down.', 'Its amazing totally worth it It blocks noises really well supper easy to conect and the battery last a lot I only charge them on my way to work about 15 mn and it runs all day', 'Noise canceling feature is good but not mind blowing.  All other Pro features are as advertised.  They sit in the ears well and fall out less than my AirPods.  Overall worth the price difference over AirPods if you plan to keep long term.', 'I have always wanted AirPods. This was a prime day steel. Was waiting till Christmas for these but prime day deals got this baby in my pocket sooner. Love the feels sound and ease it is to use and wear them!', 'Airpods were used!!! The airpods itself had earwax on them and the case was already scratched. I purchased from the warehouse and it’s not worth the cheaper price. Pay for the full price to avoid receiving dirty and used airpods. The Airpods itself work and connected to my iPhone with ease, and the sound quality is amazing, however avoid purchasing from the warehouse.', 'Used exclusively for audio books. Sound was fine but battery life was terrible. Attempted to get support from Apple Techs but quickly learned they had not manufactured the item. Very surprised and disappointed', 'Battery life is good for what they are, they’re $250 wireless headphones. They’re very overpriced, I think they’re very good but $250 is extreme. You’re paying a lot extra for the Apple name and logo.', 'Actually it was a gift for a co-worker and she loved it so much and says it even better than her iPhone.  Who knows, the only drawback is the fit for her ears.', \"Husband loves these!  The sound quality and noise cancellation are the best he has tried!  And the best part is I can't hear them either when they are on!\", 'Great integration and auto-connect for Apple products such as my iPhone. Also have really enjoyed using the Peleton with these as it is so much better than my old wired headset.', 'Think of this as an investment in your most important relationship.

Does not fall even if i am running and jumping. Got it on a good deal of $199.', 'I was very impressed with this version of the AirPods!  Noise canceling is not as good as over the ear muffs, but amazing for in ear buds.  I have used them while using my tractor and snowblower and they work great!. I would recommend AppleCare warranty to replace before it expires to extend battery life.', \"I use these mostly at the gym and they work great. You don't realize how loud it is at the gym until you activate the noise cancellation and the din disappears. I love them.\", 'They work but I can charge them unless I buy a new charger. USB - C Had it for one week and now it won’t hold a charge.', 'The noise canceling is amazing and the audio quality I would put up against my Bose any day can’t believe I didn’t purchase sooner', 'How have I gone so long without a pare of these. Excellent sound quality, and noise cancellation. But if used to long does cause discomfort in ear ,or maybe my ear canals are too small lol', 'The Airpods are not working.', 'Sound quality is good. Noice cancellation and transparency features are amazing. I really want to like these headphones but apple did a horrible job with the design. It’s impossible to keep them in your ear while working out. Even when sitting, they randomly fall out. I don’t know whose idea it was to come up with this design but it shouldn’t have even made it out of the board room.', 'These are the most comfortable buds I have ever owned,, the sound quality is second to none,, when it is in noise canceling mode,, it is like being in a deprivation tank,, complete silence,,,, also very long battery life, also the fit in your ear is excellent, my son has cauliflower ear from wrestling and these are the only ones that stay put in his ear,, Thanks for the great product..', 'Item was missing and box was dirty with black finger print ink on it, very disappointed', 'Noise cancellation is awesome but could be better. Transparency mode comes handy. Connectivity with IOS devices is super quick. Rubber ear tips are much more comfortable than previous model. Overall, better than a lot of Bluetooth earphones in markets currently.', 'Though I love the convenience, and sound quality of these headphones, they fall out often, and don’t always allow sound to come through from the iPhone.  The phone says they’re connected, but there is no sound quite often.  Not really worth the money, and a huge disappointment to me from Apple.  Not the worst headphones though.', 'Love them but just had to contact support because right air pod isn’t producing sound. I’ve had them maybe 6 months or so, and they’re covered under warranty.', 'Listen to music, books and talking. First day I used the airpro lost the rubber tip. Battery doesn’t last long', \"Everything about the AirPods was excellent except they sent an older style charger rather than the microflash one this uses.  Luckily, we have many of the chargers it needs but I don't see a way to contact the seller to see if we can swap out the charging cord.\", 'These perform better than I had expected.  Decent battery life, good sound quality for voices (less so for music) and apparently quite water resistant as they went through a full washing machine cycle and still came out working normally.', 'I have read reviews on these the air pods and the wire less ones all having wiring.  All them talk about a issue with Amazon music and the air pod.  I have not faced this problem.  They work well and hold in place most of the time.  Sound wise it’s great noise cancelation is superb.  Buy it', 'The sound cancellation was a nice touch and really works. But the battery life is not that great. But it charges quickly so I’m not a hater.', 'I would imagine after all these years they would install a battery that could last longer.

Great at the gym and everywhere else.', 'Great pair of earbuds the noise cancelling is great they sound great but they fall out of my ear so I decided to give them to my wife for her power beats pro since they have the hook around your ear but besides that everyone ear is different so you would have to just buy it and try it out for yourself because they are great earbuds', 'My sons liked these airpods.  Sound quality is great, comfortable and convenient to wear.', \"Right earbud started crackling this week. Apple's support page was not useful. Apparently this problem has been happening since late March 2020. They are now unusable because of the distortion.\", 'I bought a pair to replace my regular AirPods which I gave to my daughter but after a few frustrating weeks traded them back. Major problem; they just keep falling out of my ear. Tried the many different adapters but nothing works. The old ones would never fall out even when running and on a 10k run they would pop out at least 5 times. I also had several bluetooth connectivity issues with my watch. Noise cancellation is nice but not very good when you are using zoom as it also cancels out your own voice and so hearing your own voice feels weird.', 'I had the normal AirPods 2nd gen and thought those were amazing. 2 years later I accidentally broke them and decided to get these the other day and all I can say is these are even better. Awesome sound, bassy, noise canceling is great and they feel premium.', \"i've had other devices that offer noise canceling etc, but these are the best as far as sound range. Highly recommend and they pair great to all my other apple products.\", \"The money paid for these could be spent on other headphones for better fit and better sound quality. A definite disappointment. Considering the lack of Apple Store support - I kept hearing that the one can't get an appointment - brings the cost benefit ratio well below lower cost alternatives.\", \"Don't buy them here. I confirmed its fake and called to verify with Apple. Serial number on the box and case matches but the airpods itself have different serial codes and could not be verified by Apple. Also said made from Vietnam in the back of the case when it usually says made in China. Every other authentic check looked legit except the airpods itself with non matching serial numbers for verification when u call apple.\", 'The sound quality and noise cancellation is outstanding! But battery life? Sucks terrible. About 4-4.5 hrs. I can’t use them all day at work without them dying by early afternoon. For the price of the pro the battery life should be minimum 8 hours.', 'I use to wear Bang Olufsen but since i had this one, this become my daily ware. the sound is so clear and it fit my ears very well. good choice.', \"IDFK if my ear canal is deformed but these BITCHES do not stay in. I have made sure that my ears are CLEAN and they slip out and itakes me SO MAD. ARRRRHHHHHH. They sound SO good once they're in right, and I've tried different attachments but I'm starting to think these airpods are IMPOSTERS. I am SO voting them off AAAARGH\", 'These work with my laptop for conference calls, which is what I was looking for. Although battery life is not rated the best, it has not proven to be an issue as I use them sporadically.', \"Battery life isn't great at all. Doesn't fit ears properly so you constantly hear a clicking noise. EVERYTIME you pause music, have to pull headphones out, put them back into case and remove them again for iPhone to connect to them. Seriously, HUGE waste a money. Look ANYWHERE else besides these.\", 'Unbelievable sound, Great ear bud fit. (They prompt you through set up to make sure they fit properly.) Noise cancellation quality is so good that I would recommend switching to transparency mode for safety when walking may be affected by traffic crossings. Traffic noise is reduced to almost nonexistent. The 5 star reviews were spot on and I am very please with my purchase.', 'The noise cancellation feature is great. It removes background noise while listening to music or watching video on my iPad while sitting in my living room while the TV is on.', 'Was always dropping my phone while gardening, painting etc. It was also a dirty mess. Tried the wired ones and they were a nuisance. These fit well and have amazing sound. Rocking in the garden!', \"My only issue is the charger.  I don't have the correct plug.  I have to use a wireless pad. I would really prefer a plug-in charger like a USB port. My current telephone that I have is it iPhone 8 plus and from my understanding the new iPhones use the other chargers with the other types of plugs.\", 'I’ve avoided these things like the plague. Hate Apple ear phones. I wish I hadn’t avoided them so long. They fit my ears amazingly. They don’t hurt. The sound is great. Totally amazed by them.  I have smaller ear openings so none of the past Apple ear phones have ever worked for me. These do.  I recommend to anyone.', 'These have great sound, my problem is they do NOT hold in place at all. I’ve tried all three inserts and placing them in every position. They just fall off with simple movement every time. Kinda defeats the purpose it you have to be adjusting or replacing the second you move.', 'Love these! The noise cancellation is almost as good as my bose headphones, and the in-ear capabilities are super handy. My one and only complaint is that I wish the battery lasted longer. Otherwise, I love these headphones!', 'I can tell you ft experience that there are other brands .  If you are an Apple consumer and have apple products one would probably choose to stick with their favorite brand , which may be a bit pricey but I assure you with The imposter Apple compared to the (Apple Real)🤗 You will be excited to know that the difference is quite noticeable . I recommend highly the Apple Airpods Pro.  😻', \"They fall out all the time.  I tried all three sizes of the fittings that they come with.  Super frustrating, going back to my old airpods.  Can use these for sitting on an airplane as long as I don't move.  Not seeing any longer battery life - play time is about 4-5 hours, just like the old ones.  Probably less in noise cancelling mode.\", 'Great This is my second pair of AirPods cannot talk on the phone without them I love AirPods allows me to walk freely around and do other things while on the phone or on hold', 'Kept falling out of ears even when sitting in a chair.I found out that this happens to an awful lot of people with this product.', 'The noise cancelling is on point. They are comfortable in my ears and sound wonderful. Battery life could be better.', 'This head phone definitely works better than the 1st generation. Noise less sound quality is better Charge fast too. Recommend The 1st generation once you wear it for a long time it really hurts your ear this has an silicon in plug.', 'Fantabulous! Surprisingly comfortable considering how much silicone earbuds usually hurt my ears! Sound quality is definitely an improvement from the gen 2 that I used to own, but it is definitely not the best in the market. Delivery was soooo much faster than buying from apple directly. The only thing is I can’t get it engraved :(', 'Constantly having problems with left airpod. It takes up to an hour or 2 to resolve, cause you have to go through several links on the internet to find the fix, because it is not an easy fix. Apple support is no help here! Very disappointed with the quality, considering I really like Aripods first gen. You never 100% sure that when you take the airpods with you for a walk or to the gym they will work fine(now I have to take Airpod first gen just in case pro do not work again)', 'I can’t live without my AirPods! I have really sensitive ears and was worried at first but it was well worth the purchased. It fits perfectly and I have no pain from wearing it. I also use it for my work out.

They always seem to slowly work there way out of my ears it doesn’t matter if I try changing the size of the ear piece.', 'I love my AirPods. The sounds quality is amazing. The noise cancellation is great and I love the size of them. They are comfortable  enough I fall asleep with them in most nights. They connect fast and the battery life is great. They are perfect for working out and don’t fall out when I’m running. They don’t make my ears ache after hours of wear like my old headphones. The wireless case charge lasts a few days for me. 10/10 recommend.', 'For $220, you think they’d include the usb c  charging Cube. 🙄 Another dig by apple. Fortunately you can use your phone charger, if you don’t have one. Otherwise; they sound good, look good and are comfortable.', 'Super comfortable and snug to the ear and completely noise isolating. I had been debating getting these for a while and am so glad I finally just went for it and got them. The sound quality, features, and design are amazing.', 'Sound quality is great, noise cancellation isnt that great but they are very comfortable and the battery is great i really like how small they are you can take them anywhere.', 'The noise cancellation is better than I expected. You can block out the noise of a regular volume voice completely. I actually ran my backpack leaf blower with these in and could still hear my podcast albeit at likely a higher than healthy volume probably. The ability to switch so you can hear everything is great when I go for runs to hear traffic when approaching.', 'I had waited to buy AirPods knowing that there would be something better coming. I appreciate the smaller profile and it is the perfect amount of noise canceling for day to day, but not enough for an airplane. I still have to use headphones there but I love using them for my calls and watching and listening at home. They are just what you need for a wireless earbud. Worth the extra money for sure.', \"These will not stay in my ears and when they do they are very uncomfortable.  Sound quality is great but not worth the discomfort.  I'm going back to Airpods Gen 2.\", 'Worth it for the noise cancellation and that they CONNECT RIGHT AWAY. You take them out and they are connected EVERY TIME…love them!!!:)', 'My AirPods Pro has developed a scratchy static noise on the right AirPods.  Searching google, seems to be too common and requires replacement from Apple.  Guess they released it too quick to market.  When they worked properly they were a bit better than my legacy airPods... but perhaps these needed more time in R&D.', 'Shocked that max battery life is 4 maybe 5 hours. Crazy to spend this much money on headphones just to have to charge them after a few hours. Extremely disappointed! Buyers beware, I bough a $70 LG headset and it lasts way 12 hours constant use.', \"The transparency feature is the reason I bought these, and it does not disappoint! Makes me feel so much safer when I'm out running to know I can hear the world around me while I still hear my music. Comfortable for long-term wear and fit well. Just wish the battery life lasted a little longer, but they do recharge very quickly.\", 'Thought this would be an upgrade from my 3 yr old trashed original earbuds. Nope.

I went thru all settings and recommendations from experts on YouTube. I don’t get it. What a major disappointment.', 'They sound great! I love the transparency and noise cancellation modes! The only down side for me is that they can get uncomfortable if you wear them for a long time I like the first generation a bit better.', 'Bought through the Amazon warehouse and the description had more wear and tear than the description led me to believe.

I especially love that you can block out the world so you can focus on what you're listening to or switch it hear the noise around plus what you’re listening to at the same time.\", 'The Apple AirPods Pro are completely worth the money. Even though they cost significantly more than the original AirPods, the noise canceling feature is amazing. The battery life is also much improved. Would definitely recommend.', \"I love my new AirPods Pro.  I had old AirPods, but they kept loosing their Bluetooth connection.  My new one have no problems with that and the battery last way longer.  The sound quality is better and it's neat how text messages are read to me and I don't even have to do anything.  It even lets me reply to the text message without touching anything.\", \"My only complaint is that they fit slightly looser than my previous pair of bluetooth headphones. However, they don't fall out even when I'm running. Noise cancellation is a killer feature and they have never run out of battery on me.\", 'I love the design, I love how Siri reads you your messages when you have them in the ears.

They fit me much better than the regular AirPods. I did get a pair of CharJenPro foam ear tips, though. They help with noise blocking and make the AirPods Pro fit better.', 'I bought these as a gift for Hubby. He loves them. He was able to change the cushion for the air pod to give a better fit in his ears. He also likes the noise cancellation feature.', \"I was holding off for the longest time to upgrade my IPods. I heard about the good reviews and thought, how good can it possibly be? Answer: Awesomely good. If you haven't tried these bad boys, please do - I rely heavily on them for music, phone calls and noise cancellation. The ear socket buds fit so much better and really customizes to your ear, which helps with the noise cancellation.\", 'Really like the feel of these headphones. They work without any issues and good sound quality. One thing I wished for is to have longer battery but with the size and portability not much of an issue.', 'The noise canceling function is awesome and I can it turn it on or off using my phone or the ear bud button. I wouldn’t mind if the base of the ear bud was larger to accept a larger battery. Otherwise amazing sound quality', 'The older style stayed in place while exercising, AirPods Pro’s do not!  Very disappointed!  If you plan to wear during exercise,  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AirPods Pro.  Get the older version instead.', 'Great sounds quality and noise cancelling features. I also really like the ‘transparency’ mode that allows you to hear the room like you don’t have AirPods in. Battery like is great without noise cancelling and transparency features on and okay with them on.  Fit is great in my right ear and not as good in my left but I don’t think that’s the AirPods fault.', 'Seriously love the sound quality and the noise cancellation aspect. Can’t believe I didn’t buy these sooner. For the first time in over a year I was able to concentrate on a full conversation without being overly distracted by my two year olds playing. Downside- didn’t hear my two year old loudly singing to my newborn from her crib she climbed into. Can’t win them all, can we?', \"It is really easy to use, makes you feel comfortable and want to use, and effectively reduces the noise around you. Compared to October manufactured goods, the hinge and cover play were definitely improved a lot, and the gap in earphone unit cases was also improved positively. It's a great product to use when you don't want to hear about the coffee shop or surroundings!\", 'Came out of the box ready to go. So easy to set up with your laptop or iPhone or iPad. And once you’ve connected everything the airpods automatically switch from whatever device you are using to whatever device you choose to use, very well designed. Over all these were positively designed.', \"really awesome, this is the best wireles headphone! Just buy it, it will change your life, the voice cancelling is like magic. Only thing I'm worried about is the quality of airpods pro, because my first airpods which I purchased on 2017, the battery dead recently.\", 'Like any small ear piece devices, they are easy to lose.  But they are the best sounding Ear buds I’ve ever heard. The technology is a game changer. Noise cancellation and special audio is crazy good.  I don’t use them all the time because I don’t want to lose them. So I bought some beats flex headphones for every day use.', 'Superior in all aspects: sound quality, noise cancelation, And transparency. One down side is the sweet that build up on the cup and it could fall out, but it holds one 10x’s longer than regular AirPod! Also, sound better with one of the “special features“ enabled.. (slight negative quality difference when NC or Tr off, but I haven’t caught myself using them with NC or Tr off.. you can hear yourself😂) Amazing product! Especially if you have a gift card!

I love the way this fit and stay in my ear. Sound quality is much better that previous model. Noise cancellation works very well. Although pricey I feel these earbuds are really good and worth the money.', 'I used to wake up every morning at 7AM to the sound of leaf blowers and construction outside my apartments. Now, I wake up at 7AM every morning to the same sound, but pop these suckas in my ears and I only hear the sound of my housemate’s dog trying to come into my room. Ear tips are a bit uncomfortable for me as I’m between the medium and large. Sound is good with noise-cancelling.

They are comfortable and the sound quality is good, but not what I expected at this price. The other issue is that at times, the sound reverts back to the phone for some odd reason.

After hearing how Apple products \"just work\" for a decade, I\\'m surprised to be so disappointed in the combined performance of their products.

Neither of these expectations are met. Better products are available at this price point.', 'I bought these and they already had an assigned nasty name to them.  The right one doesn’t work at all.  They were obviously used and returned due to the defect.  I am returning and hopefully get a virgin working pair.', 'My son loves it, he upgrade from regular iPod to this iPod pro.

Great noise cancellation for earbuds, obviously not up to par with over-the-head headphones like the Sony WH-1000XM3s but very impressive. Make sure to find the right ear tips (included) for you as it makes a huge difference with bass delivery! The ONLY thing about these are that they are very pricey, but from what I can tell so far- they'll last a while.\", 'The air pods do not always connect with my phone, and will think they are connected while in the charging case (ear detection is on).

No more extra wires hanging around my neck getting caught in clothing and collars.  The sound is very clear in the ear buds and it is very easy to operate!', 'This is expensive, but very high quality. Very satisfied. You get what you pay for. Noise canceling is superb as I use it for work at home. Batteries need to be recharged twice per day. I thought that they would last longer. Other than that, great product.', 'I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality upgrade from the standard AirPods along with the noise cancelling ability! Only thing that I have had some issues with is the lack of size for the buds. I have small ears and ended up having to purchase additional buds to fit. Also there is no option to pause the music (that I have found yet) like there is on the standard Airpods. Still a great improvement!', 'They should add categories such as earpiece fit and blue tooth connection.  The small ear piece is the best fit, but won’t stay in during jogging or even weight training.  The Bose were superior with fit.  Over the past few weeks, the connection to the phone cute out often, even with the phone only a couple feet away.  This includes playing songs that are downloaded onto the phone. They look great, but I’m regretting not going back with Bose.', 'Constant static and noise cancelling not working. Apple would not honor their warranty even after Best Buy tested the AirPods found no physical damage, and sent to Apple stating the AirPods were defective. Terrible quality and service for this product. I say that as a dedicated Apple customer.', 'I was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of earphones.

They have trouble connecting to Bluetooth sometimes also. Noise canceling it my favorite part but I wish that the one side didn’t sound so grainy.', \"These are expensive, but really do the job.  I've tried several others, even the Air Pods that are not Pro, but these are the best.\", 'These fit so well, unlike the other AirPods 1&2 versions.  These stay in amazingly well and completely cancel outside noise, if you choose them to. I love everything about them and I am so glad they rediscovered this kind of fit, within every different shaped ear!', 'I bought these to replace the Bragi Dash earbuds I bought back when they were released in 2016. Although these don’t have all the features the Dash had, the Bluetooth connection is far superior. I’m glad with my purchase, but they aren’t perfect.', 'Bought as a gift.  Was told they work great. With work still offsite for meetings they  last a long time and recharge fast. Thinking of buying myself a set.', 'I ordered these sep 16 2020 and literally Jan 16 2021 they quit working.

It really feels like you enter a whole new reality when you activate it.', 'Great product, long battery life and great sound quality and noise cancelling ability', 'Excellent sound quality meet every expectations, my only negative review is that while doing any activities they tend to come out of your ears, I’ve replaced the the different types of earbuds they bring but to no avail. But that would be my only complaint.', 'Horrible return policy. After 90 days it started making magnetic sound, nothing comes out understandable. Just magnetic sound.

I will never ever buy from Apple store!!!', 'Purchased these for my teenage son.  He uses them daily and they are holding up well', 'The AirPod pros themselves and the case, even the spare ear tips were in excellent condition. Only thing that made me rate it 4 stars is that the box didn’t have a charger I could use to charge the case... Instead of the normal lighting to USB cable, it was a Type C to lightening...I didn’t even know that was possible. I’m glad I have extra iPhone charger cords', 'the one star isn’t for the airpods, the one star is because when i received the airpods i had everything in the box except for the airpod pros earbuds and the case they are supposed to come in. the next day after i get the return label and all i went to best buy and bought some and i really enjoy them, they are great earbuds so i recommend them to anyone who wants to get them. i would recommend getting them at a store in your area that sells them though.', 'The product was great!

Put them on and your iPhone is like hey sexy ear things and starts working immediately.', 'These are significantly better than the standard AirPods they stay in your ears and last longer than the previous generation model. The noise cancelling is good, but not on par with the Bose ear buds, still they work great and the sound is amazing!', 'They work until there is a loud noise around you and it sends very loud static and crackling because of the noise canceling mic. I sent it back to Apple but they won’t correct the issue and say “there is nothing wrong”. Would not recommend Apple or their products.', 'It takes an hour or two to charge. Noise cancellation works. Great sound quality. Also they made it crazy simple to pair them with my iPhone. Not bad.', 'I just receive a empty box. I would not recommend it.', 'I should have bought these airpods as soon as they came out because I really love them. I use them daily at the gym, at the store, in the car (just one, for phone calls), when I go out for a run or just about any excuse I can to wear them. They are so much better than the regular airpods in so many ways I cannot see myself not having the pros. I try to tell everyone how good they really are.', 'The sound quality is much better than I had expected. The range is fantastic and the product is very easy to connect and use. I would recommend it to anyone who can use the product.', 'I think these air pods are louder than the normal ones but I’m not to sure I lost my other ones so I can’t compare. These AirPods fall out way easier compared to the normal ones even if you swap out the ear piece. Spatial audio doesn’t work if you have an iPhone 8 which I am sad about because that’s the reason I upgraded.', 'Got these for the wife and they are great. The noise cancelling works even better than I was expecting.', 'First pair was screwed up only one here delivered sound. Called Apple and they ship me a new pair that work just fine. Very good sound and the noise cancellation feature is very good', 'I have gone through so many earbuds. Forever breaking wires or sweating them to death. Tried cheaper ones so I don’t mind replacing them but the sound was so bad. I did lose one once when not sober  when the case fell out of my purse but I knew better hahaha.

I occasionally hear static and popping on some calls. I’m not happy with the earpieces themselves. I’ve tried all three sizes and they all want to work their way out of my ear and just fall out.

I was very happy with the sound quality and noise cancellation; however, when I’ve been running with them and working out with them I’ve found more recently (a few months in) that they’re constantly slipping out with just a bit of sweat. It’s gotten to the point where when I’m running every half mile I’m readjusting the AirPod in my ear when I feel it slip out. It’s really disappointing and I hope Apple will come out with a fix for this soon, a newer style of ear tip with better material would make a difference here.', 'bought as a gift. wife loves and uses all the time during workouts and walking.', 'I listen to a lot of podcasts and this is perfect for it. The integration with my watch and phone is flawless. Well worth the money.', 'Not much to say. They work pretty darn great and last for a good amount of time. Noise cancellation doer make listening shorter, but that’s expected.', 'They are really good but I hoped for better. Battery life is good, noise cancellation is also really good.

Makes working from home much easier.', 'The AirPods Pro are great and very comfortable to use. The sound quality is terrific. Comparing them to a high dollar set of head phones, the noise cancellation is just OK; of course no one walks around in public with headphones on. Folks you call on the phone say \"it sounds like your in the room with them\". The quality of the pods and case are up to what you would expect from Apple. So, if your getting tired of untangling wires and trying to talk into a dangling mic, this product is for you.', 'Upgraded them from the 1st gen and it was a big change For sure the noice canceling is not going to make you not to hear at all but, when music is playing you can almost hear nothing but the music Now I can really listen to music on the street Great buy 👍🏽', 'My husband had the 2nd generation AirPods and they would keep falling out at work and noise cancellation was not very good unless he had volume to the max. (Which is very bad for hearing) but I got him these and he LOVES them they reach all the expectations!! 10/10 would highly recommend. He works outside with machinery and noise cancellation is excellent when he sweats they stay in place. Don’t hesitate on purchasing this product.', 'My left one has stopped working and the noise cancellation is ok. The battery life is short and I have to recharge frequently. However I do like the fit as it is comfortable and stays in my ear.

I never had the original AirPods, but I think they may have fit better since they seem smaller.', 'I was driving when I first put both headphones in and I was pretty sure I had a stroke, because the airpods pro removed all the highway sound in an instant. It actually scared me until I realized what I had done. I have recommended these to anyone with an iphone', 'I have always used wire apple earbuds but chose to go to AirPods to hopefully get the same sound quality, and it certainly has the same quality, alongside the noise cancelation. Yet it is a little weird at first but after you get used to it it’s amazing not being able to hear your surroundings fully! So far I have only had to charge them once (when I got them) and I have used them for 3 hours at a time when I go throw darts every week!', 'I bought these in February 2021 and it’s now June 2021 and the right pod isn’t working. I’ve barely used these so that’s pretty lame. Also the battery life isn’t that great. They’re kind of uncomfortable. And not being able to change the volume on the pod itself is annoying because you have to turn the volume down from the device, which defeats the purpose of “hands free” device. The beats by Dre flex wireless earphones are better in my opinion.', 'The right side is not working, it has a weird static sound coming from it. The cost to return it would be half the purchase cost because I’m not in the states, definitely not worth the hassle.', 'Great improvement over the last generation. The fit is so much more ergonomic. Much less uncomfortable lying on a pillow...they don’t dig in as much and hurt.', 'I did a side by side sound comparison test against my Bose Soundsport Free earbuds and the Bose had noticeable better lows (bass). I even conducted the \"fit test\" for my airpods successfully and enabled noise cancelling but bose still crushed it. If audio quality is your #1 go with Bose, if small form factor and ease of use are your #1 go with apple IMO. I thought for the price I would get both high quality audio and small form factor :(', 'I love these Airpods!  The sound quality is awesome!  The noise cancellation makes the world disappear!!', 'Overall the sound quality is fantastic for what they are. You can get better if you get a pair of over the ear cans with high mbps music. I use these whenever I’m out and about or on trips and they work great for that. The noise cancellation is pretty good, not Bose qc 25 great but a lot better than others on the market. I think overall they’re really well balanced headphones for the money.', 'Use this AirPods for everything.

And, they just work great.  No hassles, they just work.  Another great Apple product!', 'I use them daily for both work calls, listening to podcasts, and running. Honestly they are so seamless transition between laptop-phone-apple watch. Definetly worth it if you have multiple apple devices.', 'This was an Xmas gift to myself. The sound is great and the active noise cancelling is so much better than expected. Occasionally they will get a little loose but it’s an easy readjustment.  Took a couple tries to properly use the hand controls...touch really means press. Overall a great purchase that will definitely get used. Merry Xmas to me.', 'The left airpod cuts off occasionally when noise cancellation is turned on.', 'The apple airpods were Pretty good, the stay on your ears Pretty nicely.

They are the real air pods by the way and the noise cancellation is wonderful😉', \"Spend the money and get these! Don’t waste your money on regular AirPods or knockoffs. Don’t listen to people who tell you negative things about them. I will say if regular AirPods don't fit your ears or if you have small ears and have a hard time with earbuds anyway then I recommend trying them before you purchase. My wife has small ears and while the AirPod pros fit my ears perfectly they do not fit my wife’s ears even with the small silicon tip. Seriously though.  You won’t be disappointed!  These earbuds are amazing!  I can not believe I was considering buying the regular AirPods’\", 'English: They have good sound, all their functions works well, they came well in their box they do not have any scratches, the only thing is that I feel that the battery runs out quickly but to be used they are not bad at all.

Sound quality optimizes when you squeeze it a bit after plugging them into your ears so that the bottom tip is facing forward.

Also great sound quality when playing music during my workouts.', 'It took me a long time to justify spending $200 on ear buds but I don’t regret it at all.', 'Great product.

The pro has nylon ear pieces vs. the AirPods. The AirPods constantly fell out and the pro solved the problem. You can set the pro to allow ambient sound which makes them much safer in outdoor sports activities.', 'My daughter asked for these for Christmas, but I bought her a different brand. She was disappointed so we returned them and she got these instead. She loves them, and uses them every day.

Liked the old tapping system with the older version rather than the pinching system for making calls etc., but you get use to it.', 'I love these so much.

One major issue they fall out all the time whem working out.  Had to buy off brand wings to help them stay in which is a pin to take off to recharge the buds', 'They fit my ears pretty good. The sound could be better as far as Bass goes. Also, love how they’ve gel with Apple products as I have an iPhone 11 Pro and a MacBook Pro at the office.

Please don’t waste your hard earned money on this disappointing Apple product!', 'These are the most poorly designed product I have ever used. Pros. They sound great. Cons. If you plan to move your head at all while wearing them they will not stay in for more than 60 seconds. I have tried every size tip and none of them help at all. If you were to sit in a perfectly still position they may last for 5 minutes max. Absolute waste of money. What’s the point of great sound if they want stay in the ear.

The music is VERY clear sounding. Bass is very good but not overbearing. Sure they cost more, but I’ve had Bose and Beats, no comparison. Also, never fell out my ear while working out in the gym.

Not the same.', 'I lost my previous AirPods and needed to buy new ones and this was perfect!', \"By far the best earbuds I've ever had.

Airpods is much better where it's almost half the price, Sony WF is 10 times better. Almost every earbuds in the markets is 10 times better and cheaper. The only thing good about those airpods is the noise cancelation, it's not great but it's ok. Definitely not worth the money.\", 'I’ll admit I was hesitant to get these but they’re super worth it.

The first pair I ordered had some problems with \"popping\" noises but Amazon was great with replacing them.

They have worked perfectly for me. I’ve tried a number of less expensive ones and you can tell the difference. The features are the biggest difference. The multiple settings on the Pros are nice.

The cheaper ones are fine, but in this case you really get what you pay for.', \"The bass response isn't anywhere near as good as, say, Beats X.

The sleek look of the original pod was the only reason it took me so long to purchase.', 'The sound quality is fantastic and the noise cancellation is amazing, if you travel on airplanes or trains a lot it’s incredible how much unwanted ambient noise these babies cancel out. They also have a very good battery life, and the case charges them extremely fast. Bluetooth range on them is great as well, when I’m cleaning the house I can walk all the way from my upstairs office down into the kitchen without them missing a beat.

The pods keep their charge for days! The quality of the sound is so crisp.

They stay in my ears, block out just enough sound with noise cancellation on and let in enough sound when transparency mode is enable. I’m in love with them.', 'Noise cancellation is a nice new feature. While it doesn’t completely block everything out it does reduce surrounding noises a great deal.

Very disappointed :(', 'This is the 2nd pair I bought that did not work. I took them to the apple store and they told me that the earbuds weren’t the same which is why they won’t connect. Very frustrating.', 'Hurts my ears so bad, i already have AirPods 1, but because of bad battery I decided to buy this one. Going to return this product and buy older model with wireless charging.', \"Broke within 2 days. I returned it and I haven't gotten a single update on it. Never got a refund for that or the cologne I returned. its been 10 days\", 'Everything is very good except the in ear fit which slips out of your ears after about two minutes. The sound quality is also OK with the volume being not as high as you would like and the bass not as present as previous AirPod models.', \"I wasn't sure how I would like these.  The transparency mode is so great I often forget I'm even wearing them.\", 'So far super reds the air pods!! I put them in my ears and said who shut off the air conditioner? Well it wasn’t shut off it was the sound cancellation. Super cool!', 'I was blown away at how much more comfortable these are than the previous versions. They barely feel like they’re in, and the noice cancellation and audio pass through are both impressive. As a pretty average user, these are perfect.', 'These truly work as some of the best earbuds you can get for the money.  The battery should be better but it is what it is. Easy recommend.', 'Just bought a pair of airpods pro and they will not fit the usb port on computer to charge.  charging cable not made for usb port.  unable to use at all. unable to charge.  what a rip off.  all other earbuds can be charged by plugging charger into usb on computer. not these.  did not know.  what a waste of money for me.', 'When I first received I’m the AirPods they worked great. After a few month the left one stopped working completely.', 'With the sale for $50 off I think these are worth it.  The sound quality and fit is great.  Also, love the design and ease of use with iOS.  Great upgrade over the original AirPods!', 'I recommend the AirPod pros very easy to set up great noise canceling good battery life. Best of all the sound is awesome', 'suddenly stopped working after 2 years.  It costs have the price of the Airpods to get Apple to look at them.  I am disappointed for the price but loved the airpods while they worked.', 'Absolutely incredible sound!  As an Apple product owner, I would highly recommend these to anyone considering ear buds!', 'These AirPod pros are amazing! Battery life, the sound quality, how user friendly they are, just to name a few qualities. Everything about them are amazing. I guess the only bad thing is you can’t submerge them in water. Still 5 stars though', 'Use for the gym every day. Half the time in the case one headphone or the other doesn’t charge. The automatic ear detection doesn’t work well. I have had days where one headphone completely glitches out and doesn’t work at all. Overall like a 3/10 product. Not worth the price.', \"Constantly has pairing problems and volume issues so I have to put them back in the container and pull back out. Battery will be full off the charger but still I have to connect it to charge and pull it back off for it to actually play where I can hear it usually. For $250 I shouldn't be having issues after 3 weeks gonna see about returning after i'm off work because I'm sick of messing with them.😡\", \"Everyone I talked to on the phone said my background noise was way too loud, louder than my own voice. Tons of threads online with people having the same problem. Called apple and they had not fix.

Fast shipping and Amazon seems to always have them in stock unlike Apple store and other physical stores like Best Buy... Even got them a little cheaper too😊', 'Love my headphones!!!! My first gen finally broke on right side. Even after washing them. Dug out of my kids mouth. I got some beats and all I wanted was my AirPods back!!! So I got the Pros', 'The sound transparency mode is such a great feature. Definitely worth the extra 100 to get the pros. They’re great for private listening and people have told me that they can hear me well when we’re talking on the phone.', 'Serving its purpose It was a replacement for a family member who lost their original set', 'I used it for a few days. Sound quality is normal. Life is OK. There’s a little bit of noise. It’s worth noting. It’s made in Vietnam. It looks different from the official website. I’m going to use it for a while.', 'Most apple products are made pretty great and this is no exception. Works great. Exactly how they should work.', 'They started out great but only a month into having them they started to malfunction. There would be static while my music is playing and sometimes only 1 airpod connects even if they are both fully charged. This began a month after I purchased them with light use and no contact with water.', 'The voice picked up by the microphone is far worse than the standard wired earphone.', 'Very worth the price, great sound quality, mic is great for calls and clear for the other person. The noise cancellation and extra features are all packed in to a tiny perfect earbud. Very happy.', 'While these sound better than the regular EarPods, they’re still lacking in terms of bass, which is expected for any earbud. The battery life is kind of disappointing, especially since I mostly use them at my desk. However, the comfort is next to none. Apple really knows what they’re doing!', 'For the everyday person the sound quality is amazing when you compare them to cheaper wireless buds and going from the AirPods to these the main reason to get them is for the noise canceling. Speaking of the NC it’s good, I’m not sure if it feels on the level of a bose quiet comfort in ear but can’t wait to see how they perform on a flight!', 'I now can go to sleep even though there’s a snoring bear lay next to me. Just put them in and listen to sleep inducing music and I’m in la la land!!!!', 'Perfect for zoning out and getting work down without having to listen to the noise around you. Only remark is I hate that it messes up the video sometimes and I have to go back a couple seconds.', 'Apple AirPod Pros are the greatest! Great sound and noise cancellation.', 'Sound quality and battery life are excellent. Falling out of ears is a problem - no matter how well I push them in, the pods are not secure.', 'New Airpod pro came with hair and dirt on the right airpod - brand new (not refurbished/renewed). Also right side airpod battery level at 29% vs left side at 55% - shows it may have been used. How did this pass QC?', 'These are fake. I mean cmon i bought these because i lost my other ones. My real airpods, id throw on my wireless charger on my alarm clock. When placed they would stay orange for a couple seconds then charge. But these airpods i would put on the charger and theyd blink different colors, they also woudnt even charge but my clock said they were charging. I mean cmon what a ripoff now!', 'Almost everything is pretty good. Sadly though, the only thing that disappoints me a lot is the battery life. Not really surprised though cause it’s apple so. My other off brand AirPods lasted longer than the apple AirPods! Since it’s apple though, it can do a lot of interesting stuff so I guess that’s the good thing.', 'Absolutely love them, can’t say enough about them. Sound quality way better than Bose. If you use them when exercising, get memory foam tips-they will slip right out of sweaty ears canals.', 'I am glad I purchased Air Pods Pro. I enjoy the sound quality and easy of charging.', 'I love the AirPods Pro they sound so much better than the regular AirPods. Definitely a must buy for apple lovers. The noise cancellation is awesome it completely blocks out noises like my dads snoring and the lawn mower!', 'We researched & researched for best deal & quick delivery & this is it!! Go Amazon!!', 'Noise cancellation is perfect. I’ve been turning off and on for verification. Turned on while my wife was talking and I could only see her lips moving. I can get used to this. Turned off, I can hear fine and music in background. I have small buds on but still have to make sure they stay in. Movements like eating and talking at times dislodge pods. Almost lost one down garbage disposal. $30 for support would have been a bargain. Those that call these fake are mistaken. This is first review I’ve even written but I’m on lockdown and bored but I give these 👍', \"I was a bit skeptical about purchasing these for my Note 10+ but after receiving them and connecting to my phone, they sound AMAZING.  I do wish I had all the features (of iPhone) but a compatible android app does allow me to experience some if not all the features.  I did experience an issue with the pods falling out of my ears but used some alcohol to wipe the rubber tips and that issued was resolved quickly.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.\", 'ANC goes in and out.  Right side bud is difficult to get to play. Several options are accessible only from an iOS device, which I do not have.', \"The ANC feature takes a little while to get used to when talking on the phone.  I really prefer these (air pods pro) to my original airpods for listening to music, but prefer the original airpods for phone calls.  These are the best bluetooth headsets i've ever used - worth the price\", 'I realized looking at my purchase history that I have only had this for a month and the battery does not last. Even if I don’t use it. I use it 2-3x /week and for several times now, I would need them and they just die after 10 mins even if I charge them the night before. Would not recommend', 'The authentic real deal. Every bit as good as people claim. Couldn’t bring myself to fork over the money for the price but with some birthday gift cards I took up the Black Friday deal. Have used them every day since. Worth it.', \"Quickly learned after purchasing these that there is a firmware issue that apple has no update or easy fix for that basically makes one or both earpods useless depending, so I'm bringing them to the apple store to be replaced. The right one worked really good though!\", \"Definitely a step-up from the AirPods. The noise cancellation doesn't block out all noises, but makes for a better listening experience overall.\", 'These are really good. The noise canceling is a really cool feature. If you want even better bass quality while listening with noise canceling, might I suggest that you go to settings -> music -> EQ and choose bass booster. This helped improve the quality even more.', \"The bomb! Son loves them! They are the best! Great sound and truly no background noise. The best comfort in your ear. You don't fell them at all. Bought them for my son, now I want a pair too.\", 'Great ear pods. They can be buggy at times. Like people can’t hear you or vice versa they can’t hear you.  Not everytime either.', \"Problems powering. Only one side works. Tech chat didn't work. Called to a Live Person who could not resolve\", 'I use these for interviews in radio and tv when better sound is required.  They are perfect.  good purchase.', \"Sound quality is really a problem while listening to music. Ambient Sound cancellation is very good considering the size. Equalizer app helps the sound somewhat but it's just not in these headphones.  Songs sound flat and muted and impotent. What a shame.\", 'airpods are a great concept and everything is great except that these tend to fall out of my ears way more than the regular airpods', 'They’re great! Much better than I expected. A1 quality in packaging. I love how apple packages their products, so soft and sleek! ❤️', 'The noise cancellation is awesome, and these have really made working from home easier (having hands free to take notes, but also privacy of info within the household).', \"Love these.  Second pair.  The first ones lasted about three years.  The pro's are a bit more but better quality sound, and longer battery life.\", \"I listen to podcasts all day everyday while working, so these are constantly being used. They're comfortable and easy to use. The battery life is great too! The noise cancelling feature works amazing as well. So glad I have these in my daily life!\", 'Love these! I had the original AirPods. These fit much better in the ear and really block out outside noises. I’ve used them for Zoom meetings so far.', 'These are nice, but I feel like Goldilocks and her porridge when it came getting the right fit. They’ve fallen out of my ears multiple times.', 'These were amazing earbuds until one of the two started crackling. The noise cancelation and passive sound is amazing, until like i said, one started crackling, now im stuck with just one good earbud', 'I received a used item. Upon first connection with my phone it appeared as “Pizza’s AirPods”. I have no idea who is Pizza.', 'I lost my original pair and had to get another set. You cannot go wrong with these especially at the Amazon price. Works seamless with other Apple products as well. Overall you get great sound quality and noise cancellation for the price.', 'They were great but after the update all I hear is popping and cackling in my ears when I try to use them. I reset them several times and tried what apple recommends to no avail. I used mine for roadside assistance to call customers and never got them wet or even dropped them', 'Brand new out the box and right ear bud didn’t work at all, wasn’t even showing up on my phone as a pair only the left ear bud was connecting, very disappointed', 'Calls are crystal clear on both ends. Noise cancellation is also great. Battery life is pretty good since the charging case easily fits in your locket. Music however, sounds like trash. The ‘fit’ is terrible despite different size tips and even foam aftermarket tips I tried. They just don’t get a good seal, period; and they actually hurt after being in for a few minutes. On top of that, they fall out at even the slightest movement.', 'Works great! Perfect size to carry them around. They are not the perfect noice cancelling ear phones compare to bulky over the ear noice cancelling devices out there, but these get the job done nicely! You can just throw them in your pocket and take them with you whereever you want.', 'bought these to record yoga videos for my website. The microphone is not compatible with my brand new MacBook Pro. It records all fuzzy. However, listening to music etc. works just fine.', 'I was very hesitant to buy these because of the price but a coworker kept bragging about them.  She was right.  The sound is excellent but the touch convenience for answering a call, pausing a video, etc., is very nice.', 'You will be disappointed If you’re expecting a strong bass from AirPods pro. However, Its a keeper as overall sound quality & noise cancellation is pretty good.', \"The noise cancelling on these are what really stands out. You can turn it on and off and you cannot hear anything when you turn it on. It's really good. The sound is awesome and they contour to fit your ears perfectly. Great product.\", 'The work great, fit well, long lasting battery life and sound fantastic.', \"Don't understand why this item came without a USB charging adapter.  The charging cable plugs into case but has a 'new' smaller non-USB plug-in on the other end.  I can't charge the Airpods.  Why didn't I get USB charging cord?\", 'Horrible design. I much prefer my $20 wired ear phones. These don’t fit no matter what tips I buy. Just an overall poor design.', 'I thought it should be a brand new product, but my airpods pro already has a name. Apparently refurbished. Never trust amazon again.', 'First time purchasing Apple Air Pod and I’m not disappointed. I’ve been waiting for the older ones to go down in price, but years later they haven’t. Well, I would recommend these ones. Better look, better sound, and just better overall from Apple.', 'Great Apple product as usual ...disappointed did not receive different size adapters got ear pieces ... left country just after receiving and could not return. Need smaller earpiece cover ...', 'I always have problems with several head sets Sony, Bose etc. connecting to Windows 10 PC but apple is the best', 'When AirPods first came out, I was among those who doubted whether they’d stay in my ears, but I let myself be persuaded by users who said they were pretty secure. Bad choice. I can’t speak for your ears, but mine are apparently the wrong shape entirely. It’s hard for me to get a good seal, and the smallest of head movements can cause them to go tumbling down to the ground. This is easily the worst Apple product I’ve ever owned.', 'I was skeptical but these ear buds are awesome.  Incredibly intuitive and east to use, with good transparency and sound cancellation modes, talk modes, and ability to pause and resume.  Comfortable too.  Not cheap but worth every penny.', 'Nice product as advertised noise canceling is better than expected. Sound quality is excellent', 'Loving my airpods pro. Super comfy. You almost forget you even have them in your ear. They pair up beautifully with the iPhone. I use them with my Windows 10 laptop too. The noise canceling feature...the bomb. I love it, especially when in noisy areas like airports, on the plane, etc.', 'Was very impressed with the sound quality and cancellation. Unfortunately, they kept falling out of my ears no matter which size I tried. Ended up going back to my regular AirPods and will be gifting these to my daughter.', 'I use mine for work. Apple has done away with the double tap feature to answer a call, change a song, or hang up. Instead you have to basically pinch the tiny little airpod. Someone with big fingers will have a terrible time trying to accomplish this. I hate the way they fit. I hate how small they are. Wasted 250 bucks! Hopefully this review will help someone else not waste their money!', 'AirPods Pro frequently slips out of my ear! Something that shouldn’t happen and it never happened with the original AirPods. Also, when noise cancelation is on, it feels like my ears are popping', 'Amazing earbuds overall. They are very good for calls and listening to music. There are no other earbuds that can come even close to these if you have Apple products.', 'I use these every day for music, phone calls, and something soothing to get me to sleep at night. There is nothing better.', 'Excellent upgrading to Apple’s standard Airpods! One feature missing is the ability to manually control volume settings at the pods w/o going to your iPhone or device’s volume +/- buttons. Otherwise, these Airpod Pros are awesome!', 'The pods wouldn’t stay in my ears. I tried all three sizes and they would constantly fall out. I didn’t have this problem with the original AirPods. Loved the sound quality and noise cancellation feature but I will be returning these.', 'Love love love these! Noise cancelling feature is my favorite! I use them to study, watch movies, answer phone calls, workout, etc. and I’ve been very impressed!', \"I wasn't sure about buying these. 1 because of the price and 2 i was sure how they would fit and if they would stay in my ear. I have some wired bose ear buds but wanted wireless. I wish i had not waited so long to pull the trigger on these. There are better than i expected. They stay in my ears perfect and never fall out. I did wait till i saw them on sale before i bought them. If you are thinking about getting some believe me you won't be dissappointed.\", 'All has been said !! Is great.  Easy to carry and to use.  I was concerned to loose it … so far.  Very easy to pop it on the eat fast.  Without interruption during the call', 'I bought the Airpods as a gift for my wife.

Sound is clear and good quality, comfortable ear pieces!  A little too slippery to handle, need little grippers.', \"overall pretty good the sound quality is good, the noise cancellation is way better than I expected, but the battery life seems to fault at times but it's not too hard to deal with. If you have multiple devices on your icloud maybe leave them further when u activate it because it seems to connect to any of these devices other than my main phone\", 'Only thing I’m finding to be a problem is they aren’t real ensure in my ears while I’m active.  They will fall out.', 'Sent them back, poor sound, made my ears itch and NO noise cancellation. (Buy Apple AirPods MV7N2AM/A with charging case instead) ;)', 'These are original air pods pro, they work great, have not had any issues besides one of them slipping out during workouts but I may have to figure out which ear plug fits better.

Was a little hesitant to buy because they are so expensive, but I am so glad I did. Great sound quality and they charge very quickly. I teach online and they are great to use since they have a built in microphone.', 'They’re not for people who move around. They constantly fell out of my ears.

I normally don’t buy into the “apple only” hype, but I was glad I purchased these. 10/10', 'Greatest to use with iPhone, the noise cancellation is amazing.', 'First year they were working ok. All features worked as expected. After a year, they began loosing charge quicker, the right earphone started malfunctioning (sound quality is awful..). the left earphone for some reasons now it takes longer to fully charge vs the right earphone.. .. a bit disappointed.. likely will not buy AirPod Pro again... we have a few regular AirPods and they all have been pretty solid..', 'I love these. In five minutes the battery life went from 28% to 52%. The noise cancellation is awesome. These are the best headphones I have had in a long time. I am still playing around with features right now.

Comfortable to wear till noise cancelling is set.  Instant head ache and nausea feeling.  I cant wear them.  Gave them away', 'I love the item. My old AirPods works almost 4 years, still works well, except the battery only last no more than 1 hour now. I bought the new AirPods Pro to replace the old one. I always use it while running. The noise cancellation is working only when you use them on your both ears.  Noise collation is wonderful, the whole world is quite, and after 1 hour using, the battery still has 85% capacity. I am so satisfied with them.', 'Yet I am out of warranty by a month. Never again will I buy these.', 'I can’t remember the date I bought these airports, make six months or less.  However the (R) charges but dosen’t work no sound.  I read some reviews and a lot of people have had the same problem.  However Apple would not stand behind their product and Amazon had to step in.  My concern is what other airpods I can buy without them going out so soon.  I’m ready disappointed. Regards Linda Washington,', 'These thing a are absolutely awesome! I have owned several ear buds, the original AirPods, Samsung’s Icon X, Jabra, Samsung buds, and these things are better than all of them!

Maybe I am not a big fan of in ear headphones.', 'Outstanding product. Fidelity is superb, noise cancellation excellent and setup is a no brained. The est yet.', \"I bought these and did like the size, feel in ear, but I am too much of an audiophile.  I couldn't handle the lack of bass and frequency response.  My 20 headphones sounded better than these, and for the price I expected more..\", \"Love these, they seem to work (most of the time) even for very small ears. Sometimes I still have to push them in, but I guess, that's the discomfort of having small ears. Overall happy with the quality.\", 'I love these ear buds.

I wish they lasted all day verses half a day.', 'I was hesitant about the noise cancellation of this type of ear piece. The fit for my ear was perfect with the medium size ear piece size. The  ear bud doesn’t move and I love the sound quality. I would recommend them for sure.', 'I love the wireless earbuds, however after 3-months the internal speakers sorta blew out so at certain sound levels they buzz. Given the price point it really should not crap out 3 months in. I’m hoping I can get these replaced. We will see.', 'Didn’t know what to expect, but it’s definitely better than the regular AirPods for me. Fit comfortably and seamlessly interfaces with iPhone Pro, my only complaint is I wish it would connect to 2 devices at the same time (iPhone & iPad).', 'Love these! I can’t believe how amazing the sound is. Oh why did I wait so long to get these?', 'Great product, great sound, and most importantly they are comfortable and stay in my ears.', 'Absolutely disappointed in what was supposed to be an improvement. The product itself is great but the user experience is shockingly bad. Often won’t connect to devices. Drop down blue tooth menu doesn’t work. Slow to connect. Won’t move from device to device. Loved my original AirPods and bought these when they started to fade after 2.5 years but so pathetic.', 'Had been skeptical at first coming from Bose’s sport pods. Apple’s pro pods have clear highs, balance, and decent bass. Connectivity and range are excellent. They hook up in a flash. Good fit. Sound reduction is a big plus over the regular air pods. Good value for quality and what they offer.', 'I’ve read reviews about problems with these staying in people ears. I’ve had for less than a month and they’ve been very irritating always loosening in my ear. That’s a personal issue for some people. For some others they are great, love noise cancellation and sound quality is an upgrade from first generation', \"Great headphones, may hurt your ears with the default fitness. May sure not to push them in too deep. But over, they're nice and easy to lose.\", 'We bought these a few months ago and for the last month, the case won’t charge the pods any more and i dont know what to do. Any suggestions', \"I purchased the AirPods Pro based on many positive reviews. I don't own many Apple products and am using this with my Samsung phone. The AirPods device is nice and has good quality, noise cancellation lives up to the advertising. They work great, until they don't. I am 4 months in to using the product and my right ear bud has stopped working. I have tried all the support recommendations on resetting. Nothing works. Now they are useless to me. I really expect more resiliency in a product from Apple. Very disappointing.\", 'Great product. Sound is pretty good for the price, noise cancelling is great during subway and train commutes and on the plane. Used to work out, they stay in your ear comfortably while running. Have had them in for hours and barely notice them. Overall great product. Better if you can get them at a discount, they are a bit expensive compared to other products that are similar from Sony and other brands', 'I do wish they had longer battery life . I end up using one most of the time', \"Oh man I love these from apple, I owned airpods 1 and didn't really like it because it didn't fit me all too well.

The noise cancellation is ok nothing special but they are earbuds so I wouldn’t expect it to be amazing. However, I gave these 5 stars for the transparency mode. It works so well, it’s hard to explain but basically it sounds like the music your listening to is playing in the room your in and you can hear people talking and other noises. It’s really cool and definitely worth the $250.', \"I can't say enough positive things about how seamlessly these work. Serious thought has gone into integration into your life and ease of use. The down side is for the price they produce the same sound as a pair of $20 in ear headphones. They sounded fine to start with but I began to notice that they distort during complex pieces of music - not sure what the term is but the drivers are not agile enough. Tried multiple songs where I heard the issue against other headphones I own and cancelled out the music source being the issue. Would I buy them again - yes. Am I still disappointed - yes\", 'I bought it or dad and sister for Christmas they love them .. my sister thinks they are the best .. I hear them on it .. seems pretty good', 'like', 'Love these. So nice when there’s nothing to do and you want to listen to your fav podcast or music. Still getting to know them, but love them.', 'Zero complaints. They are worth the money. I use them in a busy clinic. It’s hectic until I put them on. Sometimes u don’t even play music I just put them on for the noise cancellation.

Battery life is too good and overall an amazing experience with iPhone 11.', 'Love them so much, great features and amazing quality!', 'Noise cancellation and the spatial audio is why to buy this wireless earbuds. seamless connection with Apple range but few minor glitches with Android, so be warned.', 'It keeps falling out my ear and if I’m on the phone and I try to push it back, my phone disconnects!!!!', 'Sounds poor (worse than included headphones for iPhones), overpriced, all fits fall out of my ears, looks like bad earrings, wearing in public is a terrible social signal, auto connect logic is a nightmare if you have multiple apple devices. First apple product I’ve hated since the Touch Bar.', 'These are really good listening and for  blocking extraneous  sound but take care where you use them. They pop out easily. Bought an attachment to hold them in. It helps but they have to come off for charging.', 'I was contemplating getting it on Amazon but it’s the same thing as you would get at Apple', 'The AirPods integrate so well into the apple ecosphere. The noise cancelling is better than my QC35’s and they take up a lot less room.', 'So this is my second pair. I had to send back the first due to a defect in which my left AirPod would not pair or charge (apparently this is common). This occurred after less than a week of use. My second pair came promptly—it’s been over a week of use with no major issues. Noise cancellation is decent, sound quality great imho, but the pesky things become loose in my ear and fall out no matter the eartip size I use. My guess is that Apple made the tip too short. Unfortunate that I paid $250 for AirPods that won’t stay in my ears without constant readjusting.', 'These worked terribly for me. They do not sit comfortably in my ears. They fall out all time even while standing still and I end up just switching to my AirPods. I wouldn’t recommend.', 'My wife loves the fit, the sound, the noise cancellation on these.

Totally worth investing especially when it is on sale.', 'Never connects, doesn’t charge, stuck on pairing mode, the right one only works.

Best product ever.', 'There is nothing to dislike. They are a drastic improvement over the standard AirPods. The extra cost is worth it for the noise cancellation, alone. The shipping was lightening fast even during the Plague.', 'Use these to listen to music as well as talk with friends sound quality is good', 'The noise canceling technology is amazing. The background noise just goes away and you are in your own little world.', 'Love Love it but the thing is that I dropped it but it kind of broke but that’s my fault not the quality is hot so I went to the Genius Bar and I asked him if it was a real one or a fake one and they confirmed that it was a real one so I don’t understand all these reviews saying that it’s fake because it is real amazing love it 10 out of 10 loved it until a job but I dropped it from my place so it’s not about the quality', 'I have had headphones that have noise cancellation as well but holy cow do these really work.

But everything else is wonderful.', 'Needed smaller ones that wouldn’t fall out of my ears and these come with three different sizes of buds to adjust to. Also like that they are a lower profile appearance when wearing than the regular Air Pods. The noise adjustment feature is AMAZING!', 'You must buy the new brick to charge these! Wish someone had posted about that...charging brick doesn’t come with pods!!  Also if you like wearing just one bud this set doesn’t allow for that as far as I can tell. Great tech otherwise!', 'Way better than her Bose poorly constructed noise cancelling headphones. Much more travel-friendly too. BOSE, your cheaply built, bulky and NC fragile ‘phones are now threatened with extinction!', 'This was a graduation gift and he reported it was what he expected in both sound Quaility and  performance', 'The first thing I want to point out about the airpod pros is how comfortable they are. I have small ear canals so it’s really hard for me to find earbuds that fit properly. The small rubber attachment fits perfectly in my ears without feeling like they aren’t in right or falling out. I’d recommend the AirPod pros for that fact alone.', 'It’s nice to have and way better than my AirPods 1 which instantly broke. Battery life just kinda died fast but it’s cool cause I was able to have them at work because they were so small and had noise transparency', 'The sound of the Apple AirPods Pro is great no matter what you like to listen to.  For those who like to listen to all kinds of music, these come highly recommended.', 'Doesn’t fall from your ear. Noise cancellation is great. Easy adjust from not having a volume rocker since I have apple watch. Can use just one side of airpods at ease. Bluetooth connectivity is fast. Wireless charging is handy since I have qi charger.', 'I like them. Easy to set up! New right out of the box. Noise cancellation is great, transparency mode is awesome! Over all sound is great and if your on a call the other person hears you a lot clear than the airpods 1st and 2nd gen.', 'Got two pairs for me and my husband his battery dies faster than mine which is weird but overall a great product', \"While these are the most comfortable airpods I've ever had, I was disappointed in the short battery life.  Luckily they are easy to recharge, and the noise cancelling feature is less than my Bose headphones, but they are handier to carry around and the charging is fast and efficient.  I'm definitely pleased with the sound quality as well.\", 'I like that I can be hands-free and listen to my music and then answer the phone. The sound quality is great and the battery life is excellent.', 'I think they are great as far as functionality. I love that I can use them with my Apple Watch while working out. My only issue is that they don’t fit securely in my ear. They seemed to at first then start to come out I tried the different sizes and I haven’t found one to work. I purchased the “hook” accessory thy is supposed to make it stay in your ear. I hope it works.', \"As long as I don't need to adjust sound/mode from the earpods themselves, they're great. I haven't had them long enough to really know if the battery life is a 4 or 5 rating, but I rated 5.\", 'When I broke my over-the-head earphones, it gave me the perfect excuse to buy these even though I didn’t want to spend that much money at the time. But I needed them. And as it turns out, they’re worth every penny. Absolutely amazing.', 'The charging cable and replacement ear bud covers are nice, but I can’t comment on the AirPod Pros or charging cable because they weren’t actually in the box.

Very disappointed.', 'I love these AirPods my husband also has a pair and he plays his tank game while I am watching TV and I can’t believe the quite time I get.  lol', 'This is a very good product! The battery life and noise cancellation was very good. The transparency mode was an essential feature because I can continue to wear my AirPods Pro when I talk to people and can still hear them well. Overall, the battery life and the AirPods Pro feature is overkill for ordinary people but this is a good value if you want convenience of AirPods but want to listen to others also.', 'I love everything about the AirPods Pro. Very simple to use and great companion to Siri for Apple iPhones. The only thing missing are wingtips specifically made for AirPods Pro. Only need the wingtips when I go to the gym but the stay in place while I do everything else.', \"I purchased AirPods Pro in March 2021.  It is now September 2021 and I cant get the left ear piece to work.  I have done everything the instructions have told me to do.  disconnected them, checked for updates, cleaned them, etc and still it doesn't work.  I really like the sound quality and they are user friendly.  I don't know if I got a lemon or if there is a problem with the programming.\", \"These were a nice surprise gift. I didn't know I needed them, until I started using them.I am not always tech savvy, but I went online for some tips on easy use and have had no problems. I use them with my iphone and ipad; I just have to remember to switch on the bluetooth for whichever device I want to use. They make my long walks more enjoyable, as I can easily listen to music or talk on the phone, hands free and with a clear connection. Very happy with this product.\", 'I didn’t want to like them as much as I do now. Only negative is it’s lacking some bass to the sound. But the trade-off for fidelity and noise cancelation is well worth it. Also, the fact that it seamlessly switches between devices is a huge plus. I just love it. Period.', 'Why did I hesitate on buying them? Perfect w noise cancellation', 'I Expected better sound quality don’t feel as much bass as regular AirPods. Noise cancellation is good as long as you have the right size tip in and as long as you’re not chewing gum or eating food otherwise they back out.

WTF I contacted amazon and the leadership will get back to me in 2-3 days so I guess I have to wait', \"At times, ear pods will fall out for no reason, moving or not.

NO.\", \"I've using the airpod pros for about 8 months and the stated 'pros' are true. However, 4 stars instead of 5 because of poor windows PC compatibility (I got the sound to work in 'stereo' mode but not the mic).\", 'Used the earlier version non-stop and love these even more so. Keeps me sane when sitting next to hubby while he is on calls all day, from working remote.', 'Bought for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. His only complaint is that he finds them a little difficult to get out of the case at least at first. Found them slick. Over time he said it’s easier but maybe they will be able to get them out more easily with the next versions.', 'After 5 months of listening one side buzzes and hums a lot if not in place perfectly and the othe one gets annoying crackling noise. very disappointing for a $250 product. Never again from Apple', 'HAHAHAHAHAHA!  There is NO WAY to charge this product as purchased. Could have been SLIGHTLY helpful to make this fact known to your consumers. Can not wait until you are broken into little bitty pieces.  Why did I ever think purchasing your product was a good idea. Return pending.', 'The noise cancellation was really good. Transparency mode can be little startling at first but you get accustomed to it after some time. Overall, it really works well because I can focus on my workout at gym thanks to noise cancellation. Highly recommended when the discount is there!', \"I do love the airpods- but every other time I go to use them, the right ear bud doesn't work- and I discover that they were never charging in the case. Something must be loose and its very frustrating for something you pay so much money for.\", 'Expecting a lot more…The problem for me is a secure fit - Doesn’t happen. Actually the first and second generation of Apple’s AirPods are better and have a longer stem to grab...

Then we opened it and the box didn't have the plastic on is and there was earwax in it and there was some scrapes on it. and on the box there is finger prints on it.\", 'Absolutely the best!!

No complaints. so far so good 👌', 'The transparency feature is very cool. The sound is crisp and full. Well balanced audio all around. These just weren’t the right fit for me. Even with 3 eat top options, they just don’t fit well or align properly with my jawbone.', 'Fantastic sound and the fit is great. I had to u-tube how to charge case and how to use controls. Needs better instructions', 'I had bought this about a month and a half ago. Considering that it’s refurbished, I can’t add apple care. I loved the product until it stopped working. The left AirPod stopped working and Amazon won’t grant any help in exchanging it since it was just days out of the return policy. These are way too expensive to break down so quickly. I’m very disappointed.', \"Don't know if I got a faulty pair or not but one earpiece is consistently behind the other in charging by half most of the time.

And they stay in my ear!', \"They don't stay in my ears with any size tip, and noise canceling is underwhelming.\", 'If you’re torn between these or the gen 1/2, get these. They’re incredible. I let my brothers, who both have the gen 2, try these, and they’re getting their own set of pros. Totally worth the extra $60.', 'The audio quality is about average, its not impressive at all. The noise cancellation is great but not perfect, it stuggles with some noises. The battery so far has been great ive charged it once every week or two and its been solid. The transparency mode is the main point and is amazing if you live in a house with others who may need you time to time.', '', 'Great for gym workouts. Excellent sound and drowning out noise around me.', \"For the extra money spent to get better fit they still fall out.  And at times the sound will only come through one ear pod.

What a joke.\", 'I did not think I was going to like these, but actually really do! The sound cancellation is awesome! And the features that if you can’t find one you can put on a alarm like sound to find, also find my AirPods is great when my son “lost” them!! Highly recommended', 'These are great. Easy to setup and use, good sound quality and noise canceling features. The ability to enhance the ambient noise is cool. Battery life isn’t great when I’m on conference calls all day, but you can easily use one AirPod at a time while the other is charging in the case for indefinite usage. High price, but no regrets on the purchase.', 'I was afraid I would’ve hear what was going on around me while I was walking, but they are perfect! I don’t miss a note or a noise!', 'I bought these for teleconference calls mostly but truth be told I just wanted them. A) if you fit these to your ears; you can literally flip your hair and jump up and down and they go nowhere. B) noise cancellation does not exactly cut out all the noise but it does bring a sense of quiet. C) i fell asleep listening to music on these and I finally took them out of my ears around 3-4 am and my ears did not hurt one bit and they were still playing. These are definitely worth the splurge.', \"Wearing these gave me a headache. Regular Airpods had the same effect. I don't know why. No other headphones or earbuds have given me headaches.\", 'As expected! Excellent quality. I do high intensity interval training and they stay in my ears perfectly.', 'Noticeable step up in sound quality and noise cancellation but regardless of what combo of tips these things fall out all the time.

I am so disappointed with this purchase.', 'compared to the regular AirPods these are not worth the money. they kept falling out of my ear when i was working out. my first generation AirPods never fall out. if i am spending more i would at least want them to fit good. none of the inserts helped. the sound quality and noise cancelling is amazing. i was just really disappointed with the way it fit.', 'Love the sound quality! The connection is flawless and the charging speed is fast. The AirPod battery life usage per charge is around 4 hours straight. Great at collecting earwax btw!', 'Good discount, original product , works super nice I’m super satisfied', 'I do not like them because they silicon tips are uncomfortable even if you are using the right size. The previos AirPods were much more comfortable', 'The add said new but they were lying!  Mine were not new!', 'I have small ears and these hurt my ears after wearing them for 5 minutes.

She says they are the best!!', 'These ear buds have amazing sound cancelling technology. They make you feel like you’re in a private concert while walking, running or working out! Love them so much and I would definitely recommend them! They are worth the price…just like all things Apple :)', 'I upgraded from the original AirPods and am very pleased that I did.

She has been using them for months and loves them. They are real and genuine Airpods Pros.', 'Amazing quality if you have an iPhone.

I’ve got uneven ears so the left pod can fall out sometimes.

I was hoping for more considering the price.', 'Very impressed with the noise cancellation feature.  I wear them on my commuter bus and they really reduce the background noise from the bus.  Battery duration is also impressive.  Well worth the money spent.  Apple did great with these!', 'I was kinda nervous about buying these from Amazon instead of From Apple, but this was the best decision and I would 10/10 do it again. This product came with the warranty same as Apple and same quality as if you bought it from Apple. If you’re looking for the best deal and save a lot of money.

I am afraid that I could even go back to other earphone products. Yes, I become addicted to apple. You got me.', 'I wouldn’t purchase something like this ever again on Amazon. The AirPods came with only 1 working side. The other ear was completely dead. Did everything from resetting to fully charging but no avail. You’re better off buying them straight from apple.

Somehow, they invariably failed the seal test despite trying different size tips and positions of the AirPods pro.  Then they sounded tinny and noise cancellation no longer worked.

After repeating procedure (puting back to box, waiting 10 sec) it works again. I have newest firmware, so I hope it will be solved with future updates.
